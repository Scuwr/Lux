## What Makes a Good Annotation?

Ultimately, a good causal graph annotation summarizes a story by breaking it down to its individual events and linking those events in causal and temporal space. You should be able to read the graph and understand the sequence of events that occured and what lead to them. No two annotations will be the same, just as written summaries will vary based on the readers perspective and what they believe is important to the story, but there are some guiding principles to ensure some consistency.

1. Nodes should be descriptive but succinct. They should relay enough information to ensure context is not lost, while also avoiding verbosity.
2. Nodes should be directly mapped to the summary. Avoid using your own background knowledge to improve a story, especially colloqualisms and jargon. If the story refers to an event as *Accelerate-Stop* do not replace that idea with a *Rejected-Takeoff* unless also used in the story. The only exception is when events can be easily inferred by the average person.
3. Each node should describe an individual concept. Use of conjunctions like and, but, yet that link independent clauses should be avoided. Short lists or conjuctions are okay.
4. Describe the facts. Avoid using the editorialization from the author and do not include recommendations or emmotional conclusions from the author.
5. Nodes should be in the third person. Identify individual subjects in the story as little as possible. General labels such as flight crew and pilot are acceptable.
6. Do not identify the author of the story. Infer their role in the flight crew is not explicitly stated.
7. Avoid attributing error. Again, describe the facts.
8. Mark as "Confusing" any stories that are monologues excusing the author's actions, and any stories that do not pertain to aviation.

## Other Notes

Annotated graphs should contain the full context and conveyed in the entirety of the story. If a causal relationship between a flight anomaly is not known by the flight crew at the time but is later mentioned in the story, be sure to include a node of what went wrong that caused the later failures. Often times, this will require a few revisions of your annotation once you've completed your first pass.

Temporal edges should only be used to convey that an event occured after another with no known cause.
