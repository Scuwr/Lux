1920608,"We identified an unsafe and potentially catastrophic condition in the Gulfstream GVII-G500 and Gulfstream GVII-G600 Airplane Flight Manual. We contacted the Original Equipment Manufacturer Gulfstream to inform them of the unsafe condition, and did not receive qualitative justification, leading to believe the unsafe condition is still present. Gulfstream promotes that the ""Appendix A1: Reduced Thrust (FLEX) Takeoff"", located in the GVII-500 and GVII-G600 Airplane Flight Manual, can be used as an alternative to the Chapter 5 - Performance, to determine allowable takeoff weight from short aircraft. To that effect, Gulfstream has also convinced airport performance providers such as Airport Performance Group (APG) to use this supplement as an alternative to Chapter 5. Customers use those blindly. This could have devastating consequences as a quick examination of the Accelerate-Go and Accelerate-Stop distances in the Chapter 5 will clearly indicate that this method does not appropriately respect necessary basic conditions to allow a safe takeoff. Example: 5,000 ft. runway at 50 ft. elevation, WET runway and 15 degrees Celsius. The Appendix A1 tells the operator the following: At the next higher pressure altitude in the chart (1000 ft because interpolation is not accepted). Takeoff flaps 20. Takeoff weight: 60,000 lb. FLD LENGTH (FT) 4970 (although not clear or explained what this parameter incorporates). V1 KIAS 116. VR KIAS 118. V2 KIAS 133. However, when reporting those parameters in the Chapter 5, at this specific V1 over VR ratio (0.983), an effective runway length of 5,000 ft., we get that the GVII-G500 aircraft would need 4,200 ft. of runway for the Accelerate-go, but would require 6,400 ft. for the Accelerate-stop distance, putting public at great risk if the pilot had to make the decision to stop the aircraft right before V1. This situation is of great concern. The FLD LENGTH parameter in the Appendix A1 does not consider the higher value of the Accelerate-go or accelerate-stop and is therefore NOT conservative. Furthermore, the said supplement does not offer an example on how a pilot would use such a supplement in lieu of using Chapter 5 to calculate performance. All of which poses a great danger to public safety and is an accident waiting to happen."
1916481,"Aircraft X was instructed to cross Runway 19 at L but instead crossed Runway 24 at L, the departure runway with an aircraft, Aircraft Y, already cleared for takeoff and in departure roll. Aircraft Y overflew Aircraft X at approximately 10ft. The taxiway that connects Runway 19 to the Alpha pad should be renamed Taxiway Alpha to avoid confusion. Taxiway alpha should extend from the alpha pad."
1870834,"We were flying ZZZ-ZZZ1. In our descent into ZZZ1 (ZZZZZ Arrival) we were approximately at 17000 feet when I (Captain) opened the speed brakes. As soon as I opened the speed brakes we received a FLAP FAIL message. We immediately performed the QRH procedures and decided the game plan would be to divert to ZZZ2. We notified dispatch, ATC, spoke to the Flight Attendant's and passengers of the situation and game plan. ATC asked us if we wanted to request priority handling, but we told them to deploy Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) just as a precaution so they could check brake temps upon landing. ATC decided to give priority handling for us. Once set up for the approach (ILS XXC-VFR conditions at the airfield) and briefed, we set up for a long straight in final and configured early. We landed without incident and momentarily stopped the aircraft on the Runway. CFR requested we pull off the next Taxiway so we elected to do that. CFR checked all brake temperatures and gave us the ok. We proceeded to our new Gate XX67 and CFR met us at the Gate for one final brake check."
1891681,"I flew behind my house and above the woods with line of sight. Upon flight I was trying different settings on the new drone. I lost control and was disoriented with the direction of flight. I lost connection to the drone multiple times and the return to home function was not set properly and it tried to return to a location that was south of me. A helicopter was in the area. They indicated that I flew within 20 feet of their aircraft but I did not see them. I tried to navigate back to my location and after multiple attempts I was successful. The helicopter followed the drone back to my location and Public Officials confiscated the drone. I do not have access to the video, only the flight logs. The App shows when aircraft are present or close. This never occurred until returning home and the helicopter was circling the house. Not sure if the helicopter was broadcasting or any other traffic was present."
1885604,"We took off on Runway XXR on the ZZZZZ departure. Climbing through 29000 ft., we received AFT COMPT LOOP FAULT. I leveled off at 30000 ft. and we ran the QRH checklist. We then received the CARGO COMPT SMOKE ECAM message and a Master Caution. I took over ATC comm 1 radio and [advised ATC] and requested return to ZZZ. The FO (First Officer) continued the checklist, changed the destination and set us up for a return to Runway XYR at ZZZ. We had an uneventful landing and the fire department used thermal cameras to check for heat signature in the AFT compartment. No indications were seen and we taxied back to the ramp. This is an edited version of my first [report] from this event. I was PF (Pilot Flying). We took off on [Runway] XXR on the ZZZZZ departure. Climbing through 29000 ft.,we had a AFT COMPT LOOP FAULT ECAM message with a Cargo Loop Fault procedure. My FO (First Officer) opened the QRH to the Cargo Loop Fault checklist. After further reflection on our actions during the event and referencing the Systems manual and QRH again, I realized the Cargo Loop Fault checklist does not fully explain how to do a Loop Test. The checklist states, ""Loop Test - Perform"" but does not go into detail on HOW to perform a loop test. The systems manual does, and on step X. Loop Test Pushbutton it states - ""Pressed and held IN"". My FO did not press and hold in the Loop Test button, he only pressed and released it. The next sentence in the QRH Cargo Loop Fault checklist states, ""If SMOKE light does not illuminate for affected compartment (smoke condition exists):"" My FO and I looked at each other and said, ""We must have smoke."" We then continued the checklist by RE-SELECTING LOOP A (which had faulted) and turned OFF the OTHER LOOP. Almost immediately we received the CARGO COMPT SMOKE ECAM Master Warning and chime as the checklist states, Procedure: CARGO COMPT SMOKE. I took over ATC communications 1 radio and [requested priority handling], requested return to ZZZ as the FO continued the checklist, changed the destination and set us up for a return to XYR back at ZZZ. Uneventful landing and the fire department used thermal cameras to check for heat signature in the AFT compartment. No indications were seen and we taxied back to the ramp. If you look at the [Aircraft] System manual, you can see the photo of the Lower Cargo Smoke Detection system and see that by re-selecting a faulted LOOP A, and turning OFF the good LOOP B, you will receive a SMOKE detection, which is what we had. In addition, if you turn the page in the QRH you will see ""Additional Information"" which uses the example of an Illuminated LOOP A fault. This information is very important and a reference to it should be included on page XXX of the QRH. I would recommend a change to the QRH CARGO LOOP FAULT checklist to edit the ""LOOP TEST - PERFORM"" to closely match the Systems manual and should read, ""LOOP TEST - PRESS AND HOLD IN"". ALL lights on the Cargo Compartment Smoke Detection panel should illuminate which will confirm a faulty loop (see second boldfaced sentence). If the SMOKE light does NOT illuminate for affected compartment, smoke condition exists. If you flip the two boldface sentences, the checklist will make more sense after you ""perform a loop test"" by holding the button IN. Since our FO's do not perform a Main Deck or Cargo compartment LOOP test during their preflight, they may not understand you must hold the button in to do the loop test."
1870987,"During the initial climb of flight number service from ZZZ to ZZZ1, we got a BLEED 2 FAIL EICAS msg at FL320 and climbing to FL350, we immediately stopped the climb and I ran the QRH. The message did not go away, but we decided then to continue to ZZZ1 at FL310 in accordance with the QRH. BLEED 2 OVERPRESS appeared 42 min into the flight (maybe 10min after the first EICAS), also persistent, we followed the QRH as well, XBLEED was pushed out for the reminder of the flight and EICAS overpress was gone. The new QRH put a band aid on the plane that lasted about 5 to 10 min. The message came back after that, the QRH thus called to request priority handling and land in nearest suitable airport. The Captain, ATC and myself all agreed on ZZZ2. We executed a descent and ran the QRC for that and landed with no other issues afterwards. The Captain got himself numbers and worked the box, while I was briefing the approach, obtaining the ATIS and talking to ATC. He also took care of the PAs. We did not exceed any limitations, nor did we request priority into the alternate. The rest of the flight was uneventful."
1868552,"I was assigned to fly the freighter ZZZ-ZZZ1. Upon arrival in operations I was notified that the plane wouldn't likely be to the cargo parking area until around XA00, even though we had a XB55 departure time scheduled. When I met the Captain I relayed what I had heard about the arrival time and he offered the idea to taxi the plane from the maintenance hangar to cargo parking. When we arrived at the hanger we were notified it was there because it had previously been involved with a fire in the ground power receptacle area. Reviewing the logbook also indicated the aircraft had been involved with a fire and had multiple repairs done because of the fire, including damage to a pressure vessel seal. I performed a personal assessment of the threats for a roughly 3 hour 45 minute flight to ZZZ1 that we were facing. -Airplane just out of maintenance with no functional check flight. -night flight. -poor weather currently and in the forecast for ZZZ. -poor weather along the route to ZZZ1. -unknown runway conditions along route. -possibly no ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) along the route. -still need reposition from hangar to cargo. -still needed to be loaded with cargo. -needed lots of de-ice. -both pilots only getting more fatigued. -best case scenario, we would depart around XA30 after showing at XC55. I expressed my concerns to the Captain and said I'm of the opinion that the airplane should have a functional check flight prior to it operating again. Also, the fear of if we have a problem, we have almost zero divert options. Captain then called flight operations to consult the concerns and they indicated that the fire was suspected to be caused from the ground power cart cable and indicated that after consulting with Maintenance, it seems safe to proceed with the flight. Reviewing the verbiage of the FOM, it states that a functional check flight is required after major work is performed and Flight Operations or Maintenance can request the flight. We jointly decided that the repairs done should warrant a functional check flight. It was then that the Captain communicated flight operations that we are opting to decline the airplane."
1864976,This report is filed to report a maintenance omission. Aircraft X arrived with an APU keel duct pressure seal missing. The aircraft was taken out of service because of the lengthy time required to correct this issue. This can lead to pressurization leaks/issues. There have been several other aircraft with the same issue.
1864918,"We were on approach to RWY 30 into BZN on the RNAV RNP 30 from Livingston transition. We were getting moderate turbulence with the wind around 600-70 kts below 10,000 [feet]. We had thoroughly briefed the approach prior to the descent. While on the approach around 5,000ft Tower advised us the an aircraft had circled to 30 from ILS 12 and during the approach experienced a 2,000 fpm updraft and moderate turbulence on approach but braking action was good upon landing. Around LAVPE, the Captain called for below the line landing checklist while we were descending on the VPATH. I ran the checklist and then looked at my Jepp Approach Chart to confirm what the missed approach altitude was, it was right after that we got a ""Caution Terrain"" aural warning followed by Tower telling us we had a low altitude warning. We then got another caution terrain warning and the Captain disconnected the AP and started to climb, I saw at that point we were below the VPATH somehow. We started to climb back towards the path and then got the RWY in sight and descended for a normal landing. Some time between me going heads down to run the below the line landing checklist and MOSNE intersection we got low and I still do not know how. We were on AP and VPATH just a few seconds prior, I don't know if we got a downdraft or what but I'm still confused as to how the aircraft got low. We decided to continue to the approach instead of going around and I believe that was the safer of the two options giving the wind gusts and moderate turbulence in mountainous and unfamiliar (for me first time to BZN) terrain. We both had a long day (I commuted in that morning because I missed my last commute the night prior due to operational delays) and had been fighting turbulence all day long on ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ-BZN routes which probably made us more tired than normal. This was my first time into BZN and the low visibility, moderate icing from the snow storm, and moderate (or greater) turbulence on approach made it tougher to concentrate and multi task. I'm not sure how we got below the path on approach as I was Pilot Monitoring and heads down running the checklist so I have no suggestions as of now. I should have done a better job monitoring our descent and VPATH even while conducting the Landing Checklist."
1864751,Me and my student were doing ground reference maneuvers near the town of Name and a rotorcraft was inbound for ZZZ. We made several calls about where we were in relation to the airport and even other aircraft could here us making the calls. The helicopter cut through our approach path and I took the controls from my student and made an abrupt decision to introduce power and climb away from the maneuver because he was descending into us. The rotorcraft then went and cut someone off on final for Runway X at ZZZ. What I feel can be done about this is the pilot needs to be talked too about visual scanning if he would've been scanning for traffic while flying and listening to radio calls this report wouldn't be typed to begin with.
1859056,"While operating Aircraft X we received a ""Cell call"" message on ACARS from our Dispatcher. The message informed us that we were NORDO and that we needed to contact center on Frequency X. In the 5 mins prior the radios were quiet. For the night in particular, we didn't find this to be that unusual because radio chatter had already been sporadic. Guard was tuned on VHF 2, however we turned it down due to unnecessary chatter earlier in the flight. As a procedure, guard should be tuned, and selected in VHF 2 with the volume turned up loud enough to be heard. If radio chatter becomes unnecessary and distracting then guard should be turned down for no longer than 5 minutes. This could alleviate any potential NORDO incidents in the future."
1858937,"Around the last week of Month during our move from the west hangar to our new facility in the east side of the airport many pallets with un-serviceable back hold parts were loaded on trailer trucks without the proper dangerous goods documentation or undeclared, with the final destination of ZZZ1. They were loaded following instructions to do so by our leadership team. We were unaware of the present of Dangerous Goods in many or several of these pallets and were not instructed of the need to provide any Dangerous Goods documentation only to load the pallets onto the trailer trucks. We neither had the system to retrieve any information that would have alert us about the presence of these dangerous goods parts."
1857915,Solo flight in PA18 with wheel skis configured in a wheels down position. Locked brake during landing resulting in propeller contacting the ground. Landing surface snow covered gravel with areas of exposed gravel. Push rod connecting front seat brake pedal to master cylinder was discovered pinned under wheel/ski pump after stopping on the runway. Aircraft was stopped on the runway following the propeller contacting the ground. Front brake pedals were not used during the landing. No additional damage to the aircraft or property. Tower was notified of the aircraft being shutdown on the landing surface and a tow was requested. Aircraft was towed from the landing surface. Locked brake perception was insidious due to slippery surface initially and the drag increased rapidly just prior to prop contact. Mid roll out there were sounds similar to the back of the skis dragging if the pressure drops a little in the wheel ski pump or the skis are not installed properly but I did not process as possible brake lock during the landing. Sound was most likely gravel kicking up and hitting the ski from the locked brake. There was also a light quartering headwind with an approximate 5kt crosswind on the same side as the locked brake to add to the poor perception. The mechanical situation is preventable with adjustment of the ski pump installation to avoid interference with the brake push rod. I also intend to add a visual check of brake rods/cables to my before landing checklist and be more vigilant for unusual sensory perceptions that do not match my expected environment.
1849581,"In short, the Tower Controller created a situation in which I felt I was out of options, and ultimately led to a wake turbulence / jet blast encounter for my student and me. I was providing flight instruction in a Cessna 172 while my student was flying the RNAV 36 at MYR (the student was wearing a view limiting device and I was responsible for looking outside, see & avoid, etc). As we were approximately 3-4 nautical miles out from Runway 36, a Navy Aircraft Y was in the tower pattern for touch-and-goes, and the Tower Controller cleared the Aircraft Y for a short approach in front of us. This was a day with winds aloft from approximately 270, so the Aircraft Y had a tail wind on the base leg. The Aircraft Y's short approach was still a rather wide base, and it appeared to be in a steady descending turn straight toward us at approximately the same altitude as us. I asked Tower if the Aircraft Y was turning towards us; Tower acknowledged they were making a short approach ahead of us; I responded that the angle looked a little close; Tower issued the Aircraft Y a traffic advisory to look for us on a 3-mile final, to which the Aircraft Y responded they had us in sight. My student continued his approach under the hood. Once the Aircraft Y turned final (I would estimate approximately 1.5 miles ahead of us, at approximately 300 ft AGL), Tower instructed the Aircraft Y to go around. I am unsure of why the go-around was given to the Aircraft Y. I was worried about wake turbulence and began to cycle through options in my head: -I determined I couldn't go around upwind, because I would have to outclimb the short approach of an Aircraft Y to avoid wake turbulence -I determined I couldn't go around straight ahead, because the Aircraft Y had applied takeoff thrust and I cannot out-climb a Aircraft Y in a C172 -I determined I couldn't go around downwind, because the wake turbulence would be blown downwind; additionally, there's a busy tour helicopter helipad just east of the runway 36 threshold so I didn't want to conflict with any helicopter traffic. In the short amount of time this took to unfold, I determined none of the above alternatives were acceptable, which left me having my student continue the approach and just hoping the wake turbulence and jet blast had blown downwind. It is the first time I've ever felt helpless in an airplane, and it really rattled me when I got on the ground and reflected on it. We continued the approach and at approximately 300ft AGL we experienced sharp, jolting turbulence for approximately one second. I believe we were lucky and did not hit the epicenter of the wake turbulence / jet blast, as I know it can flip a light GA aircraft or cause catastrophic damage. After the encounter, my student continued the approach and made a normal landing. In my state of disbelief, I failed to inform Tower of the wake turbulence encounter. After reflecting on the incident, I think both Tower and I could have made better decisions to avoid the encounter, and maybe even the Aircraft Y as well: -I may have had a case of ""get-there-itis,"" as the only scenarios that ran through my head involved continuing forward in some capacity. I believe my best course of action would have been to take controls from my student and execute a go around with a 90-degree left turn, or a left 180 degree turn. It never crossed my mind to turn around, and I will always consider that as an option going forward. -If Tower had been more cognizant of wake turbulence, they likely would not have given a Aircraft Y a short approach in front of a Cessna on final approach -Additionally, if Tower had instructed us to go around, rather than the Aircraft Y, I believe this would have been a non-event. -It is hard for me to tell, but the Aircraft Y performed a pretty wide short approach so maybe they should have kept it a little tighter or declined the short approach. -I don't believe Tower ever gave us a wake turbulence warning after giving the Aircraft Y a short approach. I have been instructing out of MYR in Cessnas for XX years so I am very cognizant of wake turbulence even without ""Caution Wake Turbulence"" warnings from controllers, but I would be worried if a student pilot solo was in that same situation got overwhelmed or couldn't properly visualize the wake turbulence."
1849672,"After deplaning all customers, our flight attendants stated that they smelled musty fumes from the mid to aft cabin area (rows 14-21) during low altitude descent during approach and that the fumes remained until the engines were shut down at the gate. I did not smell any fumes. After obtaining pertinent information from the flight attendants, ZZZ maintenance was notified, and a discrepancy was entered into the aircraft logbook. As was previously stated, the fumes event was brought to our attention only after deplaning was completed and we did not smell fumes in the flight deck."
1848362,"We operated under Medevac, but left the kidney in ZZZ. It all started with a call to Maintenance. While powering on the aircraft, the message ""EICAS OVHT"" flashed a couple times followed by ""EICAS FAULT."" At this point, I noticed a little bit of moisture surrounding the Display Unit. I called Maintenance who suggested that I run the EICAS FAULT check. It worked, the fault cleared, and by the end of my call with Maintenance, the moisture around the Display Unit's dissipated. (I only added that because the moisture was in the back of my mind the entire flight and may have contributed to me forgetting the kidney.) Right after I ended the call, my First Officer got back from his walk around and told me that the nose wheel was missing a bonding strap. I believe it was at this point I'd take a look at the release and was aware of our Medevac status. I called Maintenance back and they told me they'd be sending Maintenance out. While waiting, we set up and briefed for the flight like normal. While briefing the departure, the mechanic arrived and took the logbook with less than 10 minutes to departure time. [Mechanic] handed it back with one minute to go. I took a quick look at it, said it was good and we closed [aircraft door]. After the before start check list, I decided to recheck the corrective action and saw that the mechanic had written main landing gear instead of nose landing gear. I called Maintenance and asked him to express urgency because we were a Medevac flight. While waiting the second time and waiting for the takeoff numbers because the plane was still showing out of service, I asked the rampers if they were sure they had loaded the kidney. He told me he'd double check and came back a moment later saying it was. At XA:55, ten minutes after departure time, the mechanic gave us the logbook back with the edit. We quickly got our takeoff numbers, pushed back and taxied out. While taxiing out, Ground asked us to confirm we were a Medevac flight. At this point, I thought we were, so for the entire flight, we kept the status of Medevac. Just before we started our descent into ZZZ1, it dawned on me that we never received a notification about Dry Ice, thinking that a human organ would need to be kept cool. I checked the takeoff remarks and didn't see anything. I messaged Dispatch who said he'd check with Ops. After we landed, I saw the message that we might not have received the kidney. After parking, I went outside to watch the ground crew unload the bags until they gave me confirmation the kidney was not on board. I did however notice a box wrapped in a red plastic bag. I believe the ZZZ rampers mistook that for the kidney we were supposed to have on board. Even though it would have all but guaranteed a delay, had I gone and looked that the kidney was onboard with my own eyes, all of this would have been avoided. The fact that I was trying to avoid any delays so I could do my part in saving a life ended up causing the biggest delay of all."
1838807,"I was made aware by the A [Flight Attendant] that we only had three of our four required emergency checklists for both ditching and land emergency evacuations. As a crew we determined this to be a ""no-go"" issue, so the A requested one each of the checklists that were missing. We were initially informed that the station didn't have any. Immediately upon being informed of the situation, the Captain became very agitated and began questioning the A as to why we needed the checklists. After an explanation was attempted, the Captain, again in a very agitated manner, proceeded to get on his cell and call the Chief Pilot. As a crew, we checked the manual to confirm that we were correct in our understanding that we had to have four on board and confirmed this to be accurate, to the best of our interpretation. Someone also called for an Inflight Supervisor to come to the gate, but I am not exactly certain which of the crew made that call. A Supervisor did arrive and informed us that they were looking for one, but she had been informed that we were ok using our [tablets] in the event they couldn't find one. At no point up to this time did I feel like anyone considered this more than an annoyance and an unnecessary interruption to their abilities to board the plane for an on time departure. I was even threatened with termination of my job after I said I would not fly if we didn't have the proper equipment. We as Flight Crew are already on high alert where safety and security was concerned, we all felt like no one else cared about anything else but the flight being delayed. I have never felt less supported or more pressured by a Captain in my time of flying. When all was said and done, they found additional copies in the training room, which was what we had recommended about 20 minutes prior."
1838688,"While [enroute] to MMMM (Morelia, Mexico), we briefed and prepared for the VOR DME 2 approach to Runway 5. We were advised by Mexico Center to contact Morelia Approach and to descend and maintain 11,000 feet. Morelia Approach asked us to report 25 nm DME from the airport. At 10 nm DME, Morelia Approach cleared us for the VOR DME 1 to Runway 5. Because of high terrain on all quadrants, night time, unfamiliarity with the terrain/environment, low to the ground condition, we decided to ask the Controller to keep us on the VOR DME 2 instead. The Controller claimed to not have such an approach available for that airport. We told him we had all the information we needed to safely execute the approach in our FMS database. We sighted the runway and asked for a visual approach. We were granted clearance for the visual approach and flew the profile corresponding to the VOR DME 2 approach which we were all set up for. The landing went on uneventfully. In the future, I'll make sure to ask the Controller as soon as able for the approach in use (there was no ATIS at this airport) so that we can set up for the right approach and thus avoid last minute changes which could be fatal specially at unfamiliar/high terrain airports."
1837663,"At (XA05 L) we were cleared for takeoff from runway XX. It was a rainy night after a typhoon had passed through, and although the wind was calm, we needed our wipers on for the rain. We were accelerating normally, I called 80 knots and the captain acknowledged. A few seconds later when my eyes were scanning the engine instruments I heard several thumps against the fuselage and heard the captain say ""Birds."" He later told me he said this when he saw many medium-sized white streaks pass through our lights. I saw the captain pull the thrust levers to idle and say ""Reject."" I believe we were about 110 knots (V1 of 143 knots was well above our speed on the speed scale) but I did not notice the exact speed. After a normal RTO procedure, the captain called and I completed the QRH procedure for Rejected Takeoff. Tower instructed us to make a 180 degree turn on the runway, and after the turn we noticed that the BTMS was climbing more than expected. I calculated for a 120 knots reject at our takeoff weight (345,000 lbs) we should see a BTMS Indication of 5. When the BTMS indication on several brakes increased above 5, I called Tower and requested the fire services to come check for fire and smoke from the brakes. After the fire services arrived and told us (via Tower because fire services did not have an aviation frequencies radio) there was no smoke or fire, we saw one wheel (#2) indicate BTMS 9, and two wheels (#3 and #4) indicate BTMS 8, so asked fire services if any tires were flat. They told us that one wheel on the left side was flat, and at that point the captain decided to start the APU and shut off the engines as it was clear that we would not be taxiing back. I tried calling Company ramp/maintenance on the frequency on the chart but we got no answer, so we asked Tower to relay information to our maintenance and request assistance. Fire services then relayed to us that a tire on the right side was also flat. Maintenance arrived around time XA50 and plugged in to the intercom to let us know they would inspect and decide on a course of action. At XB25 with BTMS in the range of 1-2, they started slowly towing us back to the ramp. We exited the runway at around XC05 and set the parking brake on the ramp at 1825 Z. Multiple Bird strikes on takeoff roll causing a rejected takeoff Airport authority should be better at controlling the birds at ZZZ airport"
1837462,"During boarding First Officer and I smelled an acrid odor. It started to get stronger and the flight attendants called and let us know they smelled it as well. Since the odor was getting stronger and we didn't have any immediate indication as to what was causing it, I chose to expeditiously deplane the aircraft through the main cabin door. While exiting the aircraft, one of the customers remarked that he thought the smell ""was electrical in nature."" After deplaning we called Maintenance out to look at the jet. After some back and forth about possible causes, Maintenance decided to take the jet out of service to do a deeper dive. We swapped aircraft and completed the flight with a different tail number."
1922435,Aircraft X was conducting a training flight in the south central working area. Student was performing a simulated engine failure scenario. Student had selected a field and was approximately abeam the field descending in a power idle glide at 68 knots. Aircraft X was beginning a left hand descending turn to intercept final for the simulated emergency field at approximately 700 feet AGL when an aircraft (Aircraft Y) flew under ours. Instructor immediately took the control and executed a climbing turn away from other aircraft. Instructor was using an iPad with ForeFlight; aircraft was equipped with a stratus. Instructor did not see the other aircraft before beginning the descending left hand turn.
1883723,I was the pilot flying. Low visibility takeoff from [Runway] XXR in ZZZ. After a 30 second engine run up engines were normal. After v1 at rotation speed we experienced a violent bang followed by a right engine failure with associated yaw and severe vibration. I thought we had hit something during takeoff it was so violent. The FO (First Officer) commented 'what was that followed by engine failure? Flames were reported coming out the tailpipe by Tower. The problem was difficult to identify because the only initial indication was low fuel flow on the right engine; other engine parameters indicated normal. We flew the special engine out procedure. Cleaned up the plane and did the engine fire severe damage checklist. We had an amended release for a takeoff alternate ZZZ1. We requested priority handling and diverted to ZZZ1 climbing to 15;000 ft. The weather at ZZZ1 was VMC and the runways were long cleared. We elected to dump the center tank fuel to lighten the plane for landing. At ZZZ1 we were still overweight for landing so we entered holding and contacted flight control about an overweight landing. We then decided to land on [Runway] XXL AT 335;000 lbs. We landed uneventfully and rolled to the end of the runway where we had fire and rescue inspect the plane and were cleared to parking. This was an extremely challenging worst case scenario with poor weather in mountainous weather and an engine failure right after v1 with a takeoff alternate. The [Relief Pilot] and FO did an outstanding job of helping to identify the failure; run checklists and coordinate with ATC and the company.
1892449,After arriving at the gate in ZZZZ; the inflight crew notified me that they smelled a strong dirty sock smell during deplaning. The APU was running; but they smelled the odor prior to the APU bleed being turned on. The odor persisted during the deboarding. I called [Maintenance Control] and local Maintenance came out. I agreed to help troubleshoot by completing 2 engine runs with guidance from the local technicians. Through isolation troubleshoot procedures we determined that the odor existed when either Eng 1 or APU bleed were supplying either or both packs. Maintenance Control and local Maintenance decided to defer both the Eng 1 and APU bleed. After landing in ZZZ on the return flight; the inflight crew notified me that they again experienced the odor during descent at approximately 18k ft.
1923706,Crash Report - Hull Loss - DJI Mini 2 - Impact with tree. No damage to property. Recreational flying - Licensed UAS Pilot - Class D Airspace 0 to 50 ft. with LAANC Authorization. Winds 10 knots with gusts to 20 knots. Mission- Acquire sunset pictures. Decision Error- Attempted to fly between two trees with 15-foot gap at a distance of 200 yards. (Adverse mental state - mission placed above safety; flying an unplanned maneuver.) Temporarily lost sight of drone and immediately went into hover. Operator attempted to reposition to regain sight of drone. Operator was unsuccessful. Operator decided to yaw UAS left 360 degrees to regain situational awareness. Approximately 90 degrees into pivot; discovered that drone was really close to a tree. (Adverse psychological state induced - surprise factor with adrenaline spike). Decision Error- Operator decided to back drone away from tree; prior to completing 360 degree situational awareness pivot. Skill based error (improper control input) Operator applies significant aft control input (still experiencing Adverse psychological state of adrenaline spike). Video image goes wacky followed by loss of signal from drone. Impact with other tree. Adverse physical state: blood drains from head; sick to stomach. Adverse psychological state- Operator remembers that he purchased DJI Care package with purchase of UAS. Operator chooses joy. Operator retrieves UAS and returns to Ready Room to tell other pilots not to do this. DON'T DO THIS!!
1894363,On our descent to Grand Junction we encountered severe turbulence while being vectored to CESBA the IAF on the RNAV 29. We were at the turbulence penetration speed when it occurred due to moderate turbulence most of the flight. It occurred at about 12;500 feet; the aircraft banked approximately 30 degrees; we lost plus or minus 300 feet of altitude and had a 20 kt loss in the sudden descent. We checked in on our FA (Flight Attendant) and passengers and no injuries were sustained. We were also given a 230 heading but during the intense workload but the PF accidentally turned to 320 but was corrected promptly without any issues with ATC. We had to switch to runway 11 after a major wind shift and landed safely to end the flight.
1894632,Cleared to Land on Runway XXL at ZZZ. At minimums call-out was stable and continued. As entered ground effect; the flare was slightly flat causing a bounce. As a result of this the aircraft was left of center line. Right rudder was applied however the aircraft veered to the left and directional control was lost. The aircraft came off the runway and crossed the taxiway coming to a complete stop on the parking area. The propeller had struck the ground at slow speed once entering the taxiway. What I have learnt from this is making sure landings are not flat and the flare is initiated at the appropriate time. Whilst doing so maintain directional control and make sure toes are off the brakes on landing. And to correct in the situation would have been to go around when a bounce occurs and to apply enough rudder to maintain directional control.
1921597,I completed a visual approach and landing on Runway 15 at SAF. After landing on 15 I rolled past Taxiway F and as I approached Runway 02/20 the Tower Controller issued taxi instructions to turn left on 20 and taxi to parking via Taxiways G and A. I did not hear the latter part of the transmission clearly and asked for a repeat. He repeated the instruction as I was turning left onto 02/20. During the turn I struck something; at this time I do not know what I hit but it was large enough to reach the prop and cause significant damage. I immediately informed the Tower Controller that I had hit an unknown object. He had not observed the event. During the approach to landing an airport maintenance truck requested permission to inspect the runway; he did not state why. I assume so but do not know if the sweep was completed or if the object I hit was found. My turn was across the transition paved surface between [Runway] 15 and 02/20. I do not recall any marking on this surface and I do not believe the edges of [Runway] 15 are marked.  When I got the instruction to turn I believe I was too close to the surface over which I taxied to physically be able to see what was on the ground immediately in front of the aircraft. If I hit something like a runway light the runway environment at this location is very poorly marked. If maintenance knew there was a foreign object in the area they should have so stated and cleared the area before any further operations took place.
1906763,Towards the end of boarding B FA (Flight Attendant) asked if I smelled anything unusual aft of the aircraft; I didn't; we waited some more. B FA had communication with flight deck and said that there was a smell aft of the aircraft. I then moved to the left aft of the aircraft to see if I could notice it and did; B FA and I thought it was coming from air vents on top ably everything jump seats. Then pilots made an announcement to let passengers know we might have to deplane; then when we did deplane; maintenance happened.
1897882,Just after acceleration height and after gear and flaps were up; somewhere around 200 kts. we got master caution pitch trim light. Ran the checklist during climb and came to the conclusion we lost pitch trim control meaning the trim was stuck in an aft pitch up condition. Once we leveled off at cruise alt we concluded that 200 kts. was the best airspeed since at that airspeed the aircraft was pretty much trimmed out with very little manual elevator control needed. Called Maintenance and Dispatch and made the decision to continue to ZZZ1. Our biggest concern was how much manual elevator control was going to be needed at landing configuration and which flap setting was going to require the least manual input. Ended up [requesting priority handling] because by asking for XXL it triggered ATC to declare it for us due to priority handling. Landed on XXL with flaps 15 which turned out to be the best configuration since the approach and landing turned out to be a none event. No FAR's or aircraft limitations were exceeded or broken during event.
1931515,Upon approach to ZZZ from the south; ATIS frequency was observed; but no information was broadcast. After contacting ZZZ Approach; was advised that wind was 120 at 10 knots and cleared to enter right downwind for runway XXL.  The aircraft touched down smoothly and inline with the runway centerline. When the nose wheel touched down; the aircraft suddenly veered to the right. Attempts to correct the direction resulted in tire skidding and the aircraft nearly tipped over onto a wing. I allowed the aircraft to continue on course to avoid damage.  The aircraft entered the runway edge grass and the propeller struck a runway light.  The aircraft came to rest with no damage to the airframe or landing gear.  Upon exiting the aircraft; it was observed that the wind had changed direction and the landing had been executed with a 10-15 knot tailwind. ATC immediately changed the traffic pattern to begin landing aircraft on runway YYR after my excursion.
1889438,Received information 10 minutes after push back that HAZMAT was not secured. HAZMAT not listed since it was less than 2.5lbs of dry ice.Flight came back to the gate.
1889455,737-700 pushed back from gate to spot Bravo. Employee followed procedures to remove bypass pin when brakes were set per policy and procedure. Employee put the pin in left gloved hand then proceeded to disconnect the wireless connector that allows communications to the cockpit and the push back driver. Employee put this device in left gloved hand as well. Employee then walked from right side of nose to left side of nose and headed back to gate.Once back at gate was putting equipment back into the lead box and realized that something was missing. Employee retraced steps and saw the bypass pin on the tarmac to just about 3 ft. from the left of the nose gear. The aircraft had already powered engines and was in the process of turning to the right because there was an Airbus directly in front of him.  Immediately notified the lead to get hold of supervisor or control center to have the aircraft stop or return to gate or something so that the bypass pin could be safely retrieved and removed from being a hazard on the tarmac/taxi area.The Captain/Crew did not get notified to stop and as the plane continued around the Airbus the bypass pin was ingested into the #1 engine. Employee and other members of the ground crew saw the bypass pin get lifted from the ground and into the engine and the noise that ensued. The flight had taxied away and when finally returned to gate; Maintenance met the aircraft.
1913818,Taxiing out of ZZZ1 we noticed that the 'LEFT COMM PANEL PTT' was inoperative since Tower was calling the airplane a couple of times to give us climb instructions. Eventually the Captain realized of the malfunction and used the PTT from the yoke. During climb and already past FL180 the Captain also noticed the standby attitude indicator showing 400 ft. above normal altitude and he was showing me where I can find the altimeter reading limitations on the Fault Reporting Code manual. During cruise he also noticed that the radar was showing a lot of 'noise' on the display and we tried to troubleshoot by resetting with no success. The Captain was filling out the [form] with the faults that we had encountered so far while I was still at the controls when he noticed that the 'return to seat' light in the galley came on. He expressed his concern out loud to which I responded that from training I remember that one of the reason the light comes on is because of a depressurization of the 'main cargo deck'. He then looked at the pressurization gauges and read out loud 'Cabin 10K ft.; differential 3.8'; a couple of seconds later it dawned on him what he had just said and immediately proceeds to pull the oxygen mask; don it and broadcast PAN PAN with ZZZ Center. It took me a couple of seconds later to do the same because I just couldn't believe what was happening but shortly after I don my mask and established comms the 'CABIN ALTITUDE' master warning and EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) came on. ZZZ instructed to descend to 16;000 ft. all while I pulled the thrust levers to idle; speed breaks extended; FLCH; and set manually the speed to MMO and the Captain was reading the checklist out loud. After we concluded the checklist and still in a descent we were doing about 5;000 ft./min the Captain noticed that the cabin was staying at 10;000 ft. but the differential was slowly coming down. When we level off at 16;000 ft. ZZZ asked if we wanted to descend to 10;000 ft. The Captain consulted with me and I agreed since we had no high terrain in the area based on the depiction of the terrain feature. We continued the [descent] to 10;000 ft.; removed our masks when we leveled off and the Captain transferred left comm to me so he could talk to [dispatch].ZZZ was asking information about our intentions to what I responded to give us a few minutes since the Captain was conferring with [dispatch] on the next best course of action. I also decided to pull the speed back to 250 KTS to help with the fuel consumption in case we decided to continue to ZZZ2. We had about 30k lbs. of fuel and were burning about 9;700 pounds per hour. Distance to ZZZ2 was showing about 315 nm. ZZZ handed me off to ZZZ3 Approach.The Captain finished his conference with [maintenance] and informed me that they have decided to divert to ZZZ3 since the software used to determine fuel burn numbers wouldn't give information below FL200. I mentioned that we had enough gas to go to ZZZ2 and since the weather was perfect I didn't have a problem continuing but he reaffirmed that without 'official numbers' the safest course of action was to divert. He contacted ZZZ3 Approach; informed our decision. While he was still with [dispatch] I had already pulled out info of frequencies; altitudes; got the ATIS for ZZZ3 and were pretty much ready to brief and run checklists. I did request the Captain to ask for delayed vectors because I didn't feel comfortable with the rush to get us down since we were not in an urgency anymore. When on final approach we noticed the LAND 2; NO LAND 3 on the auto land status. We made an uneventful landing in ZZZ3 and Tower gave us an apron on [Taxiway] 1 to wait for further instructions. During interaction with Airport Authorities I provided some input on informing them of the nature of our cargo (flammable) and seal the airplane since Captain was security coordinator in a situation like this.
1929353,While doing a touch and go at ZZZ airport; the student started to takeoff without getting the carb heat in and the flaps up. I reminded the student that we needed to get the flaps up first and told him to release the back pressure and pull out the power for an aborted takeoff/full stop taxi back. There was a miscommunication with the student and he did not pull the power out right away. We both got fixated on what he was doing with the controls and not where we were going and that there was left rudder being put in. We went off the left side of Runway XX into the grass. No damage to the aircraft or persons occurred. I needed to have made my instruction more clear to him and taken the controls away from him sooner. It was too early to be doing touch and goes and we should have practiced more with stabilized approaches; go-arounds; and full stop taxi backs first. We needed to brief more about aborted takeoffs and the terminology used for putting power in/out/and idle.
1927497,Upon departing the FBO I taxied into a cone. The prop hit the cone with no decrease in RPM. Upon inspection of the prop and finding no issues I departed. The cone did not cause damage to any other aircraft or equipment. I was at an unfamiliar airport and did not receive the customary support from the FBO for parking or departure. However; the mistake was all my own and I plan to be more careful going forward.
1876863,Flight was supposed to be approximately 2.5 hours from ZZZ-ZZZ1. Immediately after takeoff from ZZZ; I (Pilot Flying) realized the electronic trim for the horizontal stabilizer was not working. It was working prior to takeoff and was used to set the proper stab trim. The First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) tried his yoke trim switches; and they also did not work. We ran the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative checklist; which restored our ability to trim the stabilizer using manual trim. A secondary effect of losing electronic elevator trim is also losing the autopilot. We decided the best course of action was to return to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ for an uneventful landing. Airplane was then turned over to Maintenance for repair.No known causal factors. We had been de-iced prior to takeoff; but there is no reason to believe there was any ice buildup or contact with the deicing equipment since the manual trim worked fine.My opinion is this event was the result of a mechanical malfunction. Sometimes complex machines have malfunctions; so I have no suggestions to prevent a similar event in the future.
1919803,On short final for Runway 27 on the RNP-M in SAN. Shortly after my FO (First Officer) called 500 [ft.]; we heard ATC clear an aircraft for immediate takeoff off Runway 27. I instantly conferred whether there was an aircraft on the runway with my First Officer as I could not see anything. We had a very brief conversation about it; questioning if we had a wrong frequency in Comms 2; that had come in for a different airport as we could not see another aircraft on the runway; and it seemed unlikely that such clearance was being issued given how close to touchdown we were. I suddenly noticed the center lights of the runway disappearing and reappearing; subsequently realizing there was in fact an aircraft taking off. Within a second or two; ATC issued a go-around; which I was anticipating at that point and executed instantly. ATC told us to start a left turn almost immediately; which I did as I was concerned about climbing over the departing aircraft.There was a bit of confusion on the heading ATC wanted us to fly on our part; so I continued the turn over the bay where I knew I would have the best visibility due to the lack of city lights. The go-around was uneventful; and ATC gave us further climb and heading instructions putting [us] on the downwind for Runway 27. We ran through our procedures to get the aircraft set up for landing on Runway 27; and landed uneventfully.
1912738,I was working the ZZZ Sector with some afternoon arrival traffic. I received a handoff from ZZZ1 with Aircraft X. I told them to expect the RNAV Runway XXL and descended them to 050. I then went back and cleared Aircraft X to cross ZZZZZ at or above 047; cleared ZZZ2 approach. The pilot read it back correctly. I subsequently slowed the aircraft after the clearance and read back. During my scan; I saw Aircraft X at 042 outside of ZZZZZ in a 044 MVA. I issued a low altitude alert and asked if they had the field in sight. They did so I cleared them for a visual approach to eliminate the MVA requirements; Aircraft X proceeded on the visual; ended up calling traffic ahead in sight; and followed them in landing without incident. This is a tough event to prevent a reoccurrence of from the Controller side because I verified that the read back was in fact correct; even listening to the audio after the fact. Somehow in the cockpit the restriction got lost as far as I can tell. Luckily in this instance; I observed the aircraft descending below my issued restriction quickly and ensured that VMC allowed them to be on a visual approach. The low altitude alert was definitely necessary to prevent a further descent. I will continue to scan at all times to continue to try to catch these errors in the future; and issue alerts as necessary to correct instances like this.
1888970,On Date at approximately XA:00; while PIC on a solo flight in my Extra 300L; I had a rolling electrical failure (first on one device; then sequentially lost use of other devices) about a minute; or so after take-off from ZZZ Runway XX with a left crosswind turnout to the Southwest. Conditions were VMC; sky clear; 10+ miles of visibility. Here is what happened: Shortly after take-off; I noticed that I lost the ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) traffic feature on my G430; so I recycled it; but when the G430; including Com. 1; didn't come back on after 30-60 seconds; I knew something was amiss.  Initially; after the Com. 1 failure; my Com. 2 was lit up; but by the time I went to use it to call the Tower; Com. 2 did not work; I then noticed the Communications panel was dead and then the LED lights on my Com. 2 went out so; I knew it too was dead. It was at this point I realized I had lost my radios and all other electricals as my tachometer too was dead. I ran a quick check of all circuit breakers; all the while maintaining control of the plane and looking for other traffic. All breakers were in; so the only prudent choice for mine and others safety; was to head back to ZZZ (NORDO). Upon reaching midfield to the West of the Tower; at about 1000 ft. AGL; I then circled around in this area to the West of the Tower about 1000 ft. or so away from it and wagged my wings over and over for what seemed like 2-3 minutes or so. To be safe; I did not want to overfly the field because the area to the East of the field there is an aerobatic box that is quite often active and there are helicopters and military aircraft at the field as well as a Company facility. I figured the Tower would see and hear me where I was and could also see me on radar. After some time; I saw no light gun from the Tower at all; so I figured that maybe it was broken. I then went southbound in the downwind towards left pattern for Runway XX and before turning base; I saw that a Aircraft X or similar aircraft was on a take-off roll; so I went back to the area West of the Tower and did some more circling and wing wagging. I was concerned; but not panicked; that this could develop into an emergency; if this electrical failure was the beginning of more going wrong with my plane; (maybe an engine failure; fire; etc.) if there was a short of some kind that might also take the magnetos off-line. So; I wanted to stay close to the field/Runways. Then being in the area to the West of the Tower; after I saw the Aircraft X take-off and away from the area and saw no planes on base; or approach; I figured it was most prudent to bring my plane in for a landing (as the AIM says with a com. failure; 'land as soon as practicable'). As I was already in the downwind for a left base; I kept close to the runway/did a moderately short approach; in case I had an engine failure. This was all the while I was pretty sure that the Tower must have seen me with all my extensive circling and wing wagging. As I was NORDO; I got off on [taxiway] A3 and then taxied back to the ramp. As soon as I exited the plane; I called the Control Tower to let them know I had a total electrical failure and the person I spoke to said given the conditions I did a good job. I gave them my name; tail number and phone number to file in their report to the FAA. They said the total electrical failure would explain why they didn't see me on ADS-B. I was surprised to find out that they didn't have radar at all to see planes with INOP ADS-B. Since the event this is what has been done. The aircraft was grounded and sent to maintenance shop to replace the battery; starter motor; alternator and to check all electrical systems. Return to service logbook sticker will show replaced battery; alternator; starter; etc. What I will do in the future: Carry a handheld battery operated radio and the control tower frequencies in for departure and arrival airports in my phone.
1887607,On Date I was operating Aircraft X for jump operations at ZZZZ.Prior to the incident I (PIC (Pilot in Command)); was told that 13 Skydivers would be practicing for a big way formation jump. There was a minor brief with the Coordinator for the formation jump wherein he advised me that they were planning on having up to 10 Skydivers hanging off of the jump step and in the door situated aft and on the left side of the aircraft. I advised the Jump Coordinator of the following:'This won't work and it's not a good idea. Here's what I mean - If we use a weight estimate of 170 lbs. per skydiver; multiplied by 10 bodies; we get a conservative estimate of 1700 lbs. aft of the center of lift or balance point. This will put the aircraft well out of the CG limitations. If this happens I'll lose pitch control of the aircraft and there's a very good chance the aircraft will stall; and possibly go into a spin.' The Jump Coordinator responded: 'OK; we'll figure out a different configuration.'My response: 'Listen; if your guys don't get this right this bird's going to drop a wing; stall and there's a good chance the aircraft will enter a spin right on top of you guys.'The Jump Coordinator though that I was joking as he responded with a laugh. I replied with a reaffirmation of my previous statement: 'hey man; I'm dead serious! If this happens and that wing drops; you guys need to get the hell out of dodge quick because there's a good chance the plane's coming right on top of you!'Prior to the skydivers boarding I warned my Trainee (who was observing on this flight from the right seat):'If these guys screw this up we're going to get some spin recovery practice... I'm hoping this won't be the case but I'm going to plan for it and carry extra speed as well as trim the elevator forward on the jump run. This way; if we get out of CG and I start to lose pitch authority; it'll buy us a few extra seconds. Just be ready because these guys lose 98% of their brain cells once they get around airplanes... Point being - let's hope for the best but expect the worst.'Takeoff and climb out were normal with no anomalies. At 12;500 ft. I flashed the standby red-light in the back of the aircraft. Two miles prior to the exit point; I turned on the red standby light which gives the 'OK' to open the jump door. 1 mile prior to the exit point; I configured the airplane with 20 degrees of flaps; pulled the power back to 1000 lbs. of torque; pulled the propeller back to the 1st detente; trimmed the nose forward; and put the aircraft in slow flight pitching for an 80-85 kt. airspeed (roughly 10 kts. faster than usual) .From there I turned on the green light signifying to the jumpers that they were clear to exit the aircraft. Immediately; the skydivers began moving from the front of the aircraft and positioning themselves on the step outside of the airplane. A few seconds past when I told my Trainee: 'look; I'm full forward on the yoke; I have no more pitch authority and I'm out of of elevator trim. At that very moment two more skydivers rushed to join the group already at the rear of the airplane. The airplane began to pitch up and yaw to the left. I immediately came in with a slight amount of right/opposite rudder to bring that retreating wing forward; and back into the relative wind. About two seconds later the left wing stalled and the aircraft rolled aggressively into a roughly 80 degree bank to the left which threw the skydivers off of the outside step. Once the skydivers were off of the plane; control was restored back to the pilot (me); I rolled the wings level; took out the rudder input and recovered from the stall and leveled the aircraft off in order to stop it from accelerating past 130 kts.From there; I made my descent to land and all else was fine.
1918784,I was operating flight XXX; ZZZ [to] ZZZ1 on Date. The crew and I were waiting for the aircraft at the gate. Once the aircraft arrived and deplaned; a FA (Flight Attendant) came up and told us about how the APU was inoperative and effected their flight out of ZZZ2. She also stated how there was a smell in the aircraft; but didn't know if it was associated with a fume event or just a funky smell. The FO (First Officer) and I went down to the aircraft and put our luggage into place. Upon entering the cockpit; both the FO (First Officer) and I commented on the smell. The smell did not seem to at first be that of 'smelly socks' but more of what the FO and I described as a well used horse stall. Thinking it was just remnants of a previous crew; we went on with our checks. The FA's got on the aircraft and while preparing for the flight made a comment about the smell. Upon hearing this I walked the aircraft trying to smell for a different smell to see if it was a fume event or just a smell. After getting back up to the cockpit; I asked the FO if he felt any different. He said he felt a little off. At this time; I then told the entire crew to get off the airplane until we figured out the source. It wasn't until the crew was off of the airplane did I start to feel a little light headed. That was when I knew it was a fume event. I then got the logbook and the FO notified Operations that we had a fume event. We waited on MX (Maintenance) to show and I then was asking the crew if anyone felt sick. At first; the FA's didn't say anything about feeling sick. They decided to go back up to the gate and wait inside. I obtained the number for [contract medical service] and advised the lead FA that if anyone of them felt sick to call [the contract medical service] and to also advise their Supervisor. MX had shown up and was addressing the problem. During this; I called [the medical service] and after my phone call with them; they advise me to be checked out by medical professionals. Scheduling then called me because I had timed out and they released me from the flight. I left to seek medical care.
1915775,A few minutes after the plane landed the ramp closed. 10 or 15 minutes after the plane pulled up to the gate the remote van came and parked the plane. As soon as the plane parked customer service pulled the bridge up to the plane and begun to deplane. There was no tail stand and the truck did not put any chocks up to the airplane. A few moments after the bridge was pulled up the nose began to bounce up and down. I called the sup and let them know what was happening and the sup instructed them to stop deplaning.
1872577,Taxiing from gate; approaching A7; ATL Ground cleared us A7 A 26R; taxi speed 15 kts. Fire Truck approaching from the right; high rate of speed crossed in front of us on service road. If I had not stood on the brakes a collision would have occurred. Fire Truck never slowed. Explained the situation to Ground Controller and said that it happens a lot. Fire Truck was returning to station. Did NOT have emergency lights on. Fire Truck driver ignoring ground procedures. Have fire truck driver abide by ground vehicle rules.
1905731,The Captain was flying the leg; and on a vectored base leg to join the approach into ZZZ. ATC asked if we saw the airport and traffic at our 12 o'clock. We called the airport in sight; but not the traffic and we were cleared for the approach for XXR. We dialed in the lower altitude and started descending on the glide slope. At around 3300-3400 ft. we were asked if we had the traffic in sight; we said no and we were told to maintain 4000 ft. I asked if they wanted us to climb to 4000; and we got a vector of 300 away from the traffic and off the approach. Then ATC made the comment it looked like we were on the localizer; and we were told to continue the approach. We rejoined the localizer and continued descending; and it was when we were about 200- 300 ft. below the glide slope that the Captain said something wasn't working right; and added power to climb out. ATC called us with a terrain alert; and we climbed to correct and the Captain finished the approach hand flown. Unclear and misinterpreted instructions by ATC caused us to change automation modes very rapidly in the terminal environment. We think that this resulted in us being in an undesired automation state; and since we were very task saturated; we didn't notice that we were not in the correct mode when the incident occurred. When things get as hairy as they did there; then looking back at it the smartest thing would have been to go around as soon as we were confused about ATC instructions and intentions. It would have given us time and let up on the workload that we were experiencing. Verbalizing task saturation would be good to do as well; and to be more aware of the saturation levels that can happen in the terminal environment.
1877870,After taking off from ZZZ-ZZZ1; we were not able to retract the landing [gear]. At around 35 feet with positive rate after calling for gear up; I tried to put the landing gear lever in the up position and was unsuccessful. We notified ATC and told them what had happened and that we wanted to level off at 3;000 feet and get some vectors so we can complete our required checklist. We ran the QRH and decided to return to ZZZ because there was no (LG WOW SYS FAIL MESSAGE DISPLAYED) so the QRH directed us to land at the nearest suitable airport. We completed the QRH and notified Dispatch of our intentions. We also briefed the flight attendants and passengers about the current situation. We never [requested priority handling] or gave any brace commands because the QRH never called for it and furthermore everything was under control and completely safe. While returning back to ZZZ; I suggested that we held for a few minutes to burn off some fuel and avoid an overweight landing. Once we were below max landing weight; we decided to contact ATC for the ILS XX. We landed without any further incident. On the ground we informed Dispatch and Maintenance Control of what occurred and Maintenance responded that they already knew because their system indicated there was something wrong with the nose wheel sensor. We briefed the Gate Agent and passengers and told them that there will be a replacement aircraft landing soon. After we swapped aircraft we departed without any further incident.
1915614,Aircraft X check on frequency at FL390 requesting FL350. I told him I have his request. I called for control. I couldn't descend to FL350 yet because of traffic at FL370 within 3-4 miles. Aircraft X said he needs to descend now so I turn him; assign him FL380; and call the ZZZ1 traffic for him. He tells me he's looking for the traffic and reads back descending to FL380. I see his data block update to FL377 and ask him about his descent. He tells me he can't maintain the altitude and is going to FL350. I turn him again but lose separation with the other traffic. I had about 4.5 miles going through the altitude of FL370. I ask what the problem is; and he says he's having a pressurization issue but that FL350 should be fine for now. But soon after requests to go lower and eventually we [gave him priority handling]. Just better communication. He said he would like to descend now but did not tell me the reason. If I knew there was an issue I could have given more urgency to vector and descend. I understand it's a possible situation and a pilot is worried about flying his aircraft first. Maybe I could have prevented the separation loss.
1893927,Misread planned dangerous good (DG) summary for final planned dangerous good summary and push back without final. Discovery was made when final weight manifest was sent to printer that included timestamp of when final DG was sent. Contacted Operations and obtained an electronic copy of final DG summary. Flight operated on time.
1890341,On visual approach backed by the ILS into ZZZ XXR; very gusty crosswinds on final. Final configuration checked and checklist complete; at slightly under 100 knots on short final near the overrun; a GPWS warning announced. After assessing glide path was normal; descent rate was normal; no terrain conflict was in sight and airspeed was fluctuating due to gusty crosswind at that moment we felt the we were still in a safe position to land in the touchdown zone and the decision to land was safer than going around with a wide body aircraft turning right over the departure end of the runway. PF (pilot flying) landed in the touchdown zone and brought the aircraft to taxi speed and exited the runway. During the debrief we believe the GPWS warning to be either erroneous or related to the very gusty erratic crosswinds.
1916405,I was outside on [the gate] wing walking on the Captain side; and saw a black passenger bag laying inside the envelope. I tried to move it before the push back as far out as I could. I took a few steps forward to wing walk and turned around and realized that the wing goes out of the safety envelope. I threw up the X but the local didn't see it in time with the engine to my right and the catering truck to my left. The wingtip got stuck on the top to the catering truck. When I turned around to face the local and realized the wing tip was going over the side of the truck I threw up the X. I saw the plane wing grazed the top of the catering truck. I thought that the safety envelope line was correct and that the wings fell inside the envelope; until the push back. During the push back is when the event occurred and it showed that the plane wing fell outside of the line. Crew Chief notified management.
1907482,After takeoff the landing gear would not retract. A Gear Tilt message was displayed on the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System. Also gear door and gear lever disagree messages became displayed. We informed departure of the problem and were given vectors while we ran the appropriate checklists. The airplane never exceeded 265 knots during the flight. We consulted with dispatch; the Duty Pilot; Maintenance Control and the mechanic onboard the aircraft. We came to the conclusion that the best course of action was to divert to ZZZ.Fuel was dumped in the ZZZ area; while in coordination with air traffic control. We proceeded to land uneventfully in ZZZ. Upon arrival in ZZZ Maintenance informed us that a body gear door had separated from the aircraft. I believe it was on the same gear as the tilt message. We did experience some vibration in the airframe at all airspeeds after departure. The vibration remained constant at all airspeeds. The vibration did cease and it is my belief that that is when the door departed the airframe.Gear would not retract after normal takeoff. Gear tilt message. After debrief with other crew members we agreed that the event was handled fairly well. All of us had minor suggestions as to what we do differently if the same event were to occur again; but overall I/we feel the event was handled okay.
1916861,After parking on spot 1 and when we were in the midst of our shut down flows; the parking brake released. I had my feet on the brakes on the rudder pedals; but apparently not enough as the aircraft rolled a couple of inches. In fact; when it happened; I thought to myself; 'Good thing I have my feet on the brakes.'; and wasn't aware we had rolled at all until my First Officer asked; 'Are we rolling?' By the time she asked; the aircraft had stopped and she noticed her brakes were ineffective as my feet were still holding pressure on the brakes.
1909753,During climb out from ZZZZ-ZZZ; CAS (Crew Alert System) message ENG2: PARAM EXCEED annunciation came on; Immediately reduced power and accomplished abnormal checklist; continued to destination because checklist stated no further action required as all parameters were returned to normal. After arrival in ZZZ; contacted Company Maintenance and advised of occurrence. After discussion of issue with Maintenance on phone and other pilot it was decided that since there were no faults recorded in the CMC; no log book discrepancy write up or Maintenance would be required prior to next flight. While investigating a separate aircraft discrepancy that occurred on flight ZZZ-ZZZ1. Company Mechanic advised me that a write up is required for the ENG2: PARAM EXCEED. We then contacted NAME and NAME1 to discuss issue. Aircraft was taken out of service; discrepancies were written up and maintenance arrangements were made. Subsequent investigation revealed that the exceedance is within the transient limit and no maintenance action is required.There should be a CAS amber warning prior to reaching limits not after. A call out and response for power reduction after flaps clean up. If foreseen; pre takeoff brief to include possible distractions at low altitudes during climb out and actions to counter. Example; avoiding Towering Cumulus or VFR traffic.
1926988,On take off; near Vr the First Officer alerted me to the fact that the Right (#2) Engine EGT was starting into the red. We did not have any ECAMs or Alerts because I'm sure they were inhibited. We also did not notice any indications of compressor stall. While continuing a normal takeoff and climb out; I eased the Right (#2) power lever back just a little out of the FLEX position and the First Officer stated that the EGT returned to the green. The EGT was probably slightly in the red for approximately 5 seconds. I then eased the right (#2) power lever back into the FLEX position and the EGT remained in the green and we climbed out normally. The remainder of the flight the engine had all normal indications. After landing and parking at the Gate in ZZZ; I made a logbook write up and called maintenance. To be honest; I have no idea why the engine began to overheat. The temperature was warm outside for ZZZ1; but it wasn't extreme. And we were using FLEX thrust; not TOGA thrust! Maintenance needs to look at this engine to make sure it is preforming properly; so that it doesn't happen to another crew.
1889016,Departed ZZZ on direct flight to ZZZ1; VFR. After takeoff heard position report of local RV-7 on assumed VFR approach to ZZZ - position report indicated '10 miles South of ZZZ airport; inbound for Runway XX'. My position report indicated 'Departing ZZZ to the south-east'. Position reports indicate separation of several miles and that aircraft should not be a factor. Approximately 5-6 miles from ZZZ at 2000 ft. the inbound aircraft passed directly in front of us on descent into ZZZ. No evasive action was required. Neither I nor a passenger with me who also holds a PPL saw the aircraft until it was almost directly in front of us; passing left to right and descending. Discussion with the other pilot was had and we both agreed that the other plane was obscured by the ceiling and A-pillar of the aircraft windshield until it was almost in front of us. I leveled at 2500 ft. and continued on my flight. I called ATC about 2 minutes later to obtain clearance into the ZZZ1 Class C. Approach made no mention of the near-miss and I do not believe that they noticed it. I did not mention the near-miss to ATC but upon landing and researching NMAC regulations under section 3 determined that I likely should have asked to make an NMAC report. After discussion of the situation with my CFI it was decided to make this report and to also alert the FSDO when they open in the AM to file a proper NMAC report.
1905794,As we took off from ZZZ on our way to ZZZ1 climbing through 12;000 I noticed a strange smell. Shortly after; we both noticed smoke in the Flight Deck. While the Captain (CA) and I were processing what was going on and subsequently calling for the Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) SMOKE FIRE FUMES checklist and doing the memory items; the Flight Attendant (FA) called using the EMER call button. After putting our O2 masks on; we answered the call and she said they were also having smoke in the cabin. We said okay and that we were working on it and to keep us updated with any changes. At this point I was running the checklist while the CA was flying. We leveled off at 17;000. The checklist called to [request landing priority] and land. At this point we requested to go back to ZZZ1.After running through the first half of the smoke fire fumes checklist we got to the part where it said to deploy the rat and turn off integrated drive generators (IDGs). The CA and I discussed it and we did not see the need to do this as the smoke began to clear. Therefore; we reverted back to the smoke evacuation checklist. ZZZ Approach gave us vectors for the ILS XR approach. We coordinated with ATC to exit the runway and have crash fire and rescue inspect the aircraft from the outside. After they cleared us we continued to the gate safely. Provide more guidance as to which specific scenario it would be best to run the smoke fire fumes vs smoke evacuation.
1908651,After push back; the Ramp Crew advised me to set the brakes. I thought l had; however I noticed one of the ramp crew waving their wands. I then noticed that the airplane was slowly moving and immediately applied the brakes. No one was hurt and no equipment was damaged.This event has really shook me up. I was sure I had set the brakes; but the parking brake worked correctly for the rest of the flight; so obviously I did not. Contributing to this event was a dark ramp and that I had the dome light on in the cockpit.Obviously; attention to detail on my part. I will also have the dome light off during push back.
1896761,While established in the traffic pattern; we were following the aircraft ahead of us; another C172 at normal sequencing. Following our touch and go on Runway XXL; a Student Pilot in a C172 was cleared for takeoff behind us. The Student Pilot behind us lost situational awareness and turned crosswind early without first clearing the turn visually. This led to us (established in the downwind) getting overtaken by the Student Pilot in the downwind. After becoming visual with the aircraft overtaking us; I executed a right 360 degree turn in order to establish a safe distance between us and the other aircraft. Tower then provided the amended sequencing to the Runway; and the rest of the flight went normally.
1898391,Destination showed 0 SM in ATIS while enroute. Crew informed me that they were planning to set up for a CAT II approach. At this point I rechecked all NOTAMs and saw the 5G NOTAM. I looked at the release and saw that there was a remark that ZZZ AMOC (Alternative Method of Compliance) was approved for Runway XXL. I messaged the crew to tell them that I showed we could only do CAT II on XXL. They responded 'that's what we are seeing also'. A few minutes later I decided to check the AMOC just to be sure. The latest version I had was not searchable and was alphabetical by airport name; not identifier so when I didn't see ZZZ as I expected I would because of the release remarks; I immediately emailed the duty managers and asked for a searchable document in case the airport name was different or I was missing something. I was sent an Excel document and ZZZ was not in it so I immediately sent a message to the crew that the remarks on the release were incorrect and we could not do a CAT II approach to any runway in ZZZ. At this time they were on final approach. They were able to land and I became curious about what their 5G uplink from Company had told them about which runways were in the AMOC. I looked in the ACARs traffic log and saw it told them 'RWY XXL 5G NOTAM IN EFFECT. SOP 5G POLICIES APPLY. RWY XXR 5G NOTAM IN EFFECT. SOP 5G POLICIES APPLY.' I referenced memo number X which told me this message meant 'All runways requested are NOT on the AMOC and FOM/SOP 5G restrictions apply'. This told me that their 5G uplink from Company matched the AMOC but the remark on the release did not. I immediately emailed the duty managers and informed the other dispatchers of the discrepancy. The CA (Captain) called me after the flight and I apologized that the automated release remark was wrong but mentioned that I saw the 5G uplink message was correct. The CA said that he thought the 5G uplink was just telling him that there WAS a 5G NOTAM not that he couldn't do a CAT II to those runways. I agreed that I found the wording of the uplink confusing too but referred him to the memo that explained the meaning of the various messages. I asked him if he ended up shooting the CAT II approach and he said he did not. I decided to file a report because the automated remark on my release was incorrect and I told the CA we were AMOC approved for that runway based on it before I verified it in the AMOC. The incorrect remark combined with the Captain's confusion about the meaning of the 5G uplink message created a situation where we nearly shot a CAT II approach to a runway that could have had 5G interference.The process we use involving release remarks to identify AMOC runways continues to fail us. I have emails showing that every time we have gotten a new AMOC the release remarks have been found to be incorrect for one or more airports. Last month this was not discovered until 20 days into the revised AMOC. On many occasions the subsequent AMOCs are removing runways; giving us further limitations to operations so it's definitely a safety concern when they are not updated. I would personally rather not have a remark on there at all than have the information be incorrect so maybe we should remove the remarks completely since our administrators cannot manage to keep them up to date. The process to needs to be fully audited; changes made to ensure compliance; and continually spot-checked.
1876085,This was the first flight after significant maintenance work on the field at ZZZ; with my autopilot and my turn coordinator both acting up. The shop replaced an autopilot servo and the turn coordinator and returned the plane to service on Date.I did an especially thorough pre-flight and run up but everything checked out. I added a pint of engine oil supplement after a recent oil change during pre-flight. The new turn coordinator worked in taxi and the autopilot worked on the ground. I filed IFR to ZZZ1 and back for a shakeout cruise and proceeded as planned.Approach asked if I was planning approaches at ZZZ1 and I told them I was just doing the shakeout flight; so flying around would be fine. Approach gave me vectors west as I ran through flows; making sure things looked good in the autopilot.About 5 minutes into the flight as I leveled out at 4;000 ft; I heard an alarm or alert and the standby alternator light was activated. I smelled hot electrical smell or smoke and started troubleshooting the primary alternator. There wasn't that much load to shed; but I turned off running lights and strobes and I cycled the alternator on and off. When I turned it off; the alarm or feedback through my headset went away; it came back on when I flipped the primary back on. I cycled it a few times; and the sound eventually faded.I asked to return to ZZZ and soon after [requested priority handling] with Approach. The electrical smell was still there; but wasn't getting worse. Approach asked me about my gear and I was able to deploy it; but I should have waited until closer to the field. Still; once they were down and I had three green lights indicated; the gear was staying down.Approach passed me back to Tower; which cleared me for landing on [Runway] XX Right. I asked for and got [Runway] XX Left; because it was closer to parking but also the nearest runway to me. Tower confirmed gear down and I landed uneventfully. About 50 yards down from my tie-down; a pilot was watching me come in and said he smelled the plane but neither of us smelled smoke after I shut down; so probably something electrical.I'll put the plane back in for maintenance to look at next week; with particular focus on the voltage regulator; alternator and battery.Reviewing the flight and areas of improvement; I should have [requested priority handling] more forcefully. I made the right decision to return to ZZZ to land; it was as close as other options and has services on the field. I also dropped the gear too far out; worried that I wouldn't have power to get them down otherwise -- I should have maintained the slicker plane and dropped the gear closer to landing; as usual.
1892744,Aircraft X had a engine change on the right motor. On the aircraft first departure the flight crew experienced high vibration on the right motor. Was just notified by [Engineering] so awaiting for more information at this time; and will provide [information] in the [company reporting form] as we progress with the report.
1908811,I contacted the ZZZ ground controller and informed them of my intentions to depart to the North West on a flight to the X area and then continue north to ZZZ1 airport; and then gave the current ATIS info.  I was cleared to taxi to runway ZZ.  Upon contacting the tower for a takeoff clearance; I was cleared for takeoff and given instructions for a right turn to the North West. I cleared the runway and turned right to the North West per clearance instructions. After clearing the horizontal and vertical limits of the delta airspace I requested permission for a frequency change. The tower controller approved my request for frequency change. I then changed frequency to ZZZ approach to request flight following and permission to fly a sight seeing path over the X area. Upon switching channels; I attempted to contact the ZZZ approach controller three separate times; between other aircraft transmissions; with no response.  The approach controller responded on the fourth attempt. There was never any concern with my position. After I was given a squawk code; I instructed to remain outside of the Bravo airspace; but I was not given a clear clearance into the X [area] airspace ('not approved or denied.....') per the controller.At this point I had a large cloud to my left; Bravo above and to my right and a layer of clouds in front of me that I could not climb above without violating the Bravo airspace. I could not turn left without violating VFR cloud clearance spacing.  The only option left was to descend below the clouds in front of me before breaching cloud clearance. My descent apparently put me near the path of inbound traffic; that was on the other side of the clouds to my left which blocked my field of vision.  I never saw the traffic. Nor did I feel any wake/turbulence. I was never in the clouds. The air continued to be smooth.  Upon my return I was informed to contact the tower. I was then informed of a possible deviation.  I wasn't given a restriction to deviate from.For topics relevant - I was never given a heading; an altitude restriction; or informed of inbound traffic (at any point); by the ZZZ tower. I was on a climb and still below three thousand feet at the time of incident; therefore plus 500 did not apply.Prevention of recurrence - Aircraft departing airports that sit under a busy airspace should be given more attention; particularly when the departure direction keeps them engaged with multiple airspaces/special use areas; i.e. issue squawk code before clearance to takeoff.  Tower controllers should be informed of inbound / handoff traffic earlier.
1871669,The nose of the aircraft slide across the hold short line of [Runway] XXR. We advised Tower that the nose came across the hold short line. They issued an abort for a AC that was just issued a take off clearance on [Runway] XXR. The Tower thanked us for letting them know soon because the aircraft did not initiate the takeoff role. There was active snow and the hold short line and sine was covered in snow. As I preceded to stop the aircraft it was on ice so it slide to a stop just past the hold short line. The nose was between 5 feet to10 feet past the line The taxiing was difficult because of all the snow very slippery there were many times that the ac was slipping. It would have been nice if the taxi services were plowed and treated. The hold short sine was covered in snow and was difficult to see with the active snow.
1900799,ATC informed crew that [we would] have to remain at FL330 due to crossing traffic. After traffic passed overhead at approximately 2;000 feet above aircraft; ATC instructed [us] to climb and maintain FL370. At FL335 crew encountered the wake of the aircraft that had passed above. Aircraft snap rolled in a split second to an estimated 90 degrees to the right and pitched down 5 degrees. Crew recovered the aircraft extremely quickly and climbed to FL370. One passenger and aircraft technician were not buckled during the incident. No injuries or issues noted. Passengers were informed directly after encounter by the PIC as to what happened. Aircraft landed with further incidents. Maintenance team performed inspection for excessive G loading after landing as a precaution. Excessive G loading was not experienced during event. No damage was found.
1892245,On straight-out departure from CNO to ZZZ tonight just after sunset; I planned to climb to 2600 ft. MSL but misread the altimeter and leveled off at 1600 ft MSL. The dim lighting condition of the dusk and the shade on the altimeter due to the downward angle of my headlight were contributing factors. It was difficult to judge my altitude above ground when it is getting dark but not completely dark. As I approached Chino Hills; my GPS terrain warning system was activated which prompted me to re-check my altimeter reading and realized I was 1000 ft. below my planned altitude. I started climb out immediately and cleared the hills at 2500 ft. MSL. Although I may have stayed legal in this process by initiating the climb early enough before the rising terrain; the highest terrain in that area is ~1500 ft. MSL and I could have been involved in an accident if the error in my interpretation of the altimeter reading was not corrected promptly. In addition to cross checking instruments and pilot carefulness; an altitude check from the ATC (in this case the CNO Tower) acknowledging 'altitude 1600 ft.; frequency changed approved' if workload permits at dusk and night may be an additional preventative measure.
1884667,We had a smoke; odor & fumes event.This was not a A320 dirty socks event... on approach about 6;000 AGL I was notified of a faint electrical cord burning smell in aft cabin/galley area. I told the FA's (Flight Attendants) to keep me informed if it got worse and we would land in a few minutes.I was told upon arrival at the gate the FA's speculated it was probably smell from a passengers older laptop (FA's said faint electrical burn smell in back of aircraft that went away fairly fast). I speculated it was possibly pollution smell as we were on descent well below 10;000 ft.The FA's did report that they turned off the passenger charging ports when they detected the smell  I noted this in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry and report.No passengers or crew reported ill effects.Dispatch notified; Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry made; Smoke; Odor & Fumes form completed; and conference call with Maintenance Operations Center and [Checklist] completed upon arrival per Flight Operations Manual.
1918380,Drone lost link; no communication of this. Called ZZZ [TRACON] and they said it lost link. Recommendation- Communicate when a drone looses link.
1887319,We were flying a Visual Approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ. At about 1500 ft. MSL; Tower offered us Runway XXL; seemingly due to closeness of the aircraft in front of us. We were given 160 kts. until the marker; and had not configured to our final flaps (30). When we accepted Runway XXL; I 'went inside' and re-tuned to the Runway XXL Localizer. We made the 1000 ft. call; but had not fully configured. We got a 'Too Low; Flaps' alert and I selected flaps 30. I had 'tunnel vision'; focusing on the approach profile; which was normal; and didn't call for a go-around. We continued the approach and landing.Don't accept a runway change close in. We should have gone around when we got the alert. Aviate first; (complete configuring); then Navigate (I was distracted when I re-tuned and we really didn't need the new localizer to fly the visual); then Communicate (we both missed the Before Landing Checklist).
1930688,I arrived to work at XA00 for a midnight shift and assigned both North Control and CIC (Controller in Charge). Middletown Sector was staffed with a Controller only; not CIC capable in the Tracon. Prior to me signing on; Management was informed that one of the 4 midnight Controllers would not be in until XC00L. No Controllers or Supervisors were required to be held over to help out with the extraordinary departing traffic or TFR for the event. OSU; a Contract Federal Control Tower stayed open until XE00L; normally closes at XB00L; for the departing traffic. I also informed ZID Columbus sector that I had 35 departures proposed at XC00L and that it would be abnormal traffic for a typical [night]. They thanked me later that I informed them of the extra traffic as they help over extra Controllers to help them work the abnormal traffic. As a CIC; I had a report of a UAS in the TFR and was not able to relay the information to the DEN (Domestic Events Network) until 3 hours after the incident. Management should have been in the facility the entirety of the TFR to help with coordination. 3 Controllers for 3 positions as well as CIC is not a safe operation.
1923391,We were operating Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1; with a planned departure from Runway XX; due to the remaining runways being closed. Based on our performance calculations; we were legally and safely able to depart from that runway. We lined up on Runway XX and pushed up the thrust levers for takeoff. Just after commanding 'set thrust'; we received an aural alert stating 'CAUTION SHORT RUNWAY; SHORT RUNWAY'; as well as an EICAS message stating ' SHORT RUNWAY'. I immediately rejected the takeoff and retarded the thrust levers. We notified ATC; taxied clear of the runway; and found a spot to park the aircraft in coordination with ATC. After bringing the aircraft to a stop and completing the after landing checklist; I called the Duty Officer; who arranged a conference call with Captain. Based on their guidance; we temporarily selected the GND PROX RUNWAY OVRD switch to inhibit the RAAS (Runway Awareness and Advisory System) from giving us another alert on our subsequent takeoff. We completed the RTO checklist; as well as the after start and before takeoff checklist; verified our fuel was sufficient per the Flightplan/Release; and proceeded for another takeoff; which was uneventful. The RAAS on the B777 did what it was programmed to do; which is to alert the crew on a runway that has an available length of less than 7;500 ft. and the ground speed is greater than 40 kts. Runway XX at ZZZ has 7;278 ft. available. Not being familiar with this particular alert; I decided to reject the takeoff. I have never encountered this scenario in my six plus years of operating the B777; mainly because takeoffs on relatively short runways are rare; but I also do not recall seeing this scenario in any training environment. Maybe I missed it somewhere along the line; but it could be incorporated in a future syllabus.
1869925,On departure; [we] received [an] UNABLE RNP EICAS message. [We] believed [the message] to have been directly related to [a] local 5G NOTAM. Due to ATC informing us of [a] previous departure receiving effects of 5G-related malfunctions; [we] strongly believe this to be related to 5G near PDX. 5G near airports is a safety issue affecting automation and navigation.
1895081,After run-up and instrument check; departed ZZZ2; picked up IFR pop-up clearance to ZZZ3 with 3 souls on board and 4 hours fuel. Approximately halfway to our destination; we suffered complete electrical shut down. Momentarily losing control in a dark cockpit in IMC at night; we lost our checklist and flashlight to the floor. Making available the artificial horizon on Foreflight coupled with a stratus and opening Foreflight on iPhone with the use of an Approach plate into ZZZ1; the most direct route to final was made and so was a safe landing. Once on the ground; an immediate call to ATC was made with a report of the situation. In future; I will be wearing a head-light and my checklist secure within hands reach.
1891576,On take-off roll; the yaw damper engaged while in the off position and took control of rudder pedals. Take-off was aborted.
1891422,Just before departure; I received one of the newer NOTAC (Dangerous Goods Form) stating we were carrying two fire extinguishers. The airbill # was XXX-XXXXXXXX. I kept one copy and returned the other to the Ops Agent. Since I hadn't seen the new forms yet; I looked in my EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) for information and looked in the Manual. I found the relevant sections detailing the new form and when it was required. During cruise; I looked over the form again and saw a note in the corner saying that a note was required to be on the Release indicating Dispatch was aware of the HAZMAT and it was entered on the Dispatch Release for tracking purposes. Since this had not been done; when we landed I called Dispatch and we conferred. He said there was nothing to be done at that point and so I am filing a report as my action.
1932488,On an IFR flight plan into ZZZ with a student under the hood flying the LOC Y Runway XX low approach only. We were on approximately a 2 mile final and at this point a Citation which we had been tracking on our ADS-B was now same altitude off our right wing. They were previously issued an instruction to follow my aircraft and be number two for Runway XX into ZZZ. The Controller in the Tower was asking for multiple position reports from four aircraft inbound to the field. The Controller then issued the Citation a right 360 instruction and rejoin final for Runway XX. This instruction turned the Citation right over the top of my aircraft and the ADS-B in was alerting traffic was 400 ft. directly above us. Following that we were given the instruction to go missed at 800 ft. MSL and 1 mile for the runway. The student executed the missed as instructed by Tower and I informed the Tower of the near midair collision from my perspective and loss of separation. Though I believe the verbiage I used on the radio of the time was 'near miss.' I was then given a phone number to call once on the ground; which I did and spoke with the Controller on duty at the time of the near midair collision. When asked why he turned that aircraft into our flight path; his response was because he didn't want to turn them over the field and they were above us. This entire event could potentially been avoided if the Tower had radar; but they don't and rely on aircraft reporting their positions.
1907055,"At FL380 we received a CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING"". We immediately donned oxygen masks and established crew communications. The First Officer (FO) contacted ATC and I started an emergency descent. The FO ran the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist. As we were descending; the FO stated that the cabin altitude was 9000 ft. The CABIN ALTITUDE warning light remained on for about 8-10 minutes and then extinguished. I don't know exactly at what altitude this occurred; but I believe it was in the low teens. After the FO completed the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist; requested special handling and coordinated a divert into ZZZ. We accomplished all normal checklists and an uneventful ILS XXC approach and landing. We taxied into parking without incident. CABIN ALTITUDE 2 was enunciated on the status page. My ears popped as we received the warning and I felt slightly light headed as I was donning the oxygen mask. It went away shortly thereafter. Overall; I think we did a good job. I could have included the experienced jumpseater in the resolution of the event sooner. Once he was involved; some of the load was lifted from the FO and I. The other jumpseater was a new hire and this was his first flight on the 757."""
1893869,Departing [Runway] XXL ZZZ XA:35 on Date; a pair of military helicopters were passing left to right over Runway YY; below 100 ft.  We switched to tower frequency and received immediate takeoff clearance w/ traffic advisory on 6 mi final.  Not advised of military helicopters flying in formation over Runway and as we began takeoff roll we assumed they would hold short of XXL. As it became evident they would not; an abort was quickly considered; and I decided against it as we had entered the high speed regime.  We delayed rotation as we ran directly below the two military helicopters; had we rotated we would have collided.  Had the military helicopters had a midair; or descended we would have collided.  Contacted ZZZ Tower upon arrival in ZZZ1; Supervisor initiated an investigation. Received a call several hours later from supervisor requesting additional info.  Sup stated we should have been advised of military helicopters traffic; however a review of tapes indicated no advisory was made.  He further stated that evidence reviewed warranted further investigation; that he was writing a report and submitting it for review of procedures.If we were made aware of the traffic there is 0% chance we would have accepted the takeoff clearance. Suspect local controller was distracted by traffic on final.This was an unsafe operation; we should not have been given takeoff clearance; or advised of traffic so we could have not taken off.  In retrospect an immediate reject while still in low speed regime may have been the safest course of action; but we really expected them to hold short of our runway.
1876484,I was flying Aircraft X Cessna C-172N from ZZZ to ZZZ1. This was a personal flight to help maintain pilot proficiency. This is a rental aircraft from a flight school located at ZZZ. I did a full checklist-based pre-flight inspection; and normal takeoff from ZZZ. Flying my planned ZZZ1 RNAV XX approach; I proceeded to ZZZZZ; via ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ2 altitudes; and performed pre-landing checks. Had 4 white lights on the Runway XX PAPI; reduced power to lose altitude and speed. PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; I adjusted power and attitude to maintain glide slope. Checked airspeed was in the white; added first notch of flaps. Waited for aircraft to stabilize; verified PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; checked airspeed; adjusted power; added second notch of flaps. Almost immediately after second notch of flaps there was a loud bang; an immediate turn to the right; losing altitude very quickly. I corrected the uncommanded turn as much as possible; adjusted power to maintain altitude; looked for cause of problem. I noted one flap up; one down; and went around. Gained altitude; circled; and carefully explored controllability of the aircraft; 'no change' to the flaps was best for aircraft controllability. I landed without incident. In addition to the control system failure; the aircraft apparently suffered damage to the flaps. The flight school Mechanic; and the flight school; are not communicating with me; so I do not know the extent of the damage. A careful look at GPS data shows the aircraft was operated within limits; including Vfe; at all times prior to the incident. While this flight ended with a safe landing; for me this was a very close call; and caused me a few sleepless nights processing the event. I was mentally processing the event through the evening of Date1; and did not report the control system failure as quickly as I should have. It took me a while to overcome the seriousness of the event before I started my reporting responsibilities.Not having any communication or support from the flight school added additional delay. I was hoping for more information and cooperation from the school in the reporting process; as well as resolving what happened and how to avoid this situation in the future. I regret my delay and have reviewed my reporting duties and responsibilities as pilot in command to help ensure prompt reporting as required by regulations.
1913350,My student and I flew to ZZZ1 where we executed multiple successful touch and goes. We experienced very slight engine roughness during one of our takeoffs from ZZZ1 for a brief second due to my student advancing the throttle too quickly. Other than that; nothing was out of the ordinary. After a few landings we departed for one more touch and go at ZZZ.The approach into ZZZ was normal; and we had no indications of engine trouble. After touching down on Runway X; my student added full power to takeoff; forgetting to remove the flaps beforehand. Flaps were set 20 degrees; so our initial airspeed after lift off was very low (somewhere around 50 KIAS). This was the first moment I came on the controls; only to keep my student from pitching up anymore; and to keep him from removing the flaps before we were at a safe airspeed/altitude to do so. Still assisting my student with slight forward pressure on the yoke to allow airspeed to increase; I removed 10 degrees of flaps. As soon as I set the flaps from 20 to 10 degrees; the engine began running extremely rough and we experienced a partial loss of engine power. I cannot recall the exact altitude; but we were roughly 400-500 ft. AGL. So that leaves us at a very low altitude; with little to no runway left ahead of us; and a decrease in lift from reducing flaps just before the loss of power occurred.I immediately took over the flight controls. I noticed we went from a respectable climb rate to only maintaining level (at full power). I verified the fuel selector was on both; fuel mixture was full rich; and checked engine instruments. Oil pressure read slightly high; nothing catastrophic. However; the roughness sounded and felt to be getting worse; and I was not confident that we would be able to maintain altitude much longer. Due to our critically low altitude; and the uncertainty of whether or not the situation would deteriorate further in the next few moments; I made the decision to execute a precautionary landing; while the possibility of landing on a runway still existed. I informed ZZZ Tower that we were experiencing engine roughness and stated that I was turning around to land Runway XY. At the time I made that call; I did not declare an emergency because it was only engine roughness; and although it was the worst engine roughness I've ever heard; and I was fearful that the engine would give out - it hadn't yet and we were still making power. I was prepared to declare an emergency if the situation got any worse; but after the point when I began my turn there was no time to do anything except fly the airplane.I made a left turn into the wind to begin my descent for Runway XY. Losing altitude in the turn; and considering load factor/airspeed; I turned with the minimum radius possible while avoiding a stall/spin situation. The stall horn came on for a moment; and it became clear that we were not going to make the runway. I had a few moments left to consider the remaining options: land on Taxiway 1; or try to clear the GA ramp/Terminal to land in the grass beyond them. The Taxiway was the safest option; considering no other aircraft were occupying it at the time; and Runway XZ-XA is closed. I touched down on Taxiway 1; brought the airplane to a stop; and regathered my thoughts. Tower asked if our engine was still operational; to which I answered yes. I offered apologies to the ZZZ Tower for landing on Taxiway 1; because as mentioned above; I did not have enough time to declare an emergency/update them on my situation once I began the descent to land. I requested to taxi to the GA ramp and shutdown.Final words:If I could have a second chance on dealing with this scenario; I would have done everything exactly the same. As much as I wanted to fly a pattern for Runway X and do a precautionary landing with a headwind; that option did not seem to be on the table. My choices were:Enter a downwind for Runway X and hope we keep the limited performance we have to make it all the way around the pattern; orLand the plane as soon as possible before it turns into a complete power lossI chose the latter and would do it again.
1935714,During pre flight in cockpit the aircraft was felt to lurch and shake. Followed by constant vibrations and another lurch. I witnessed the bag loader from the jet bridge in contact with the plane. Ramp agent said she contacted the plane with the belt loader and then backed off.
1866852,Very short taxi to [Runway] 8L in Ontario so we had discussed and ran before takeoff checklist down to the line before leaving ramp. As we approached 8L I had called Tower and let them know we were ready for departure. If I remember they briefly told us to hold short awaiting IFR clearance and then it was just a couple seconds later she cleared us for takeoff on Runway 8L. The Captain was taxiing the aircraft into position as I was running the before takeoff checklist. As the airplane was just getting aligned with centerline the Captain mentioned he thought there was something on the runway. I was actually looking towards the far end of the runway to see if I could see any type of strobes or lighting as it was night time. It was once we had all the aircraft lights on that we could clearly see a van parked broadsided right on the middle of the runway about 1;000 feet in front of us or so. I had not yet called before takeoff checklist complete or verbally mentioned Runway 8L verified before the Captain had noticed something on the runway. No takeoff power was added or anything like that. I called the Tower to let them know there was a vehicle on the runway and the controller seemed very surprised. The controller cancelled our takeoff clearance and gave us a clearance to line up and wait. Controller then began communicating with FAA ground vehicles to try and get a hold of whomever was on the runway. Controller was unable to contact vehicle on the runway but was able to get a nearby airborne helicopter to hover over the vehicle and use a spotlight and or loud speaker to alert the personnel on the ground. We saw the ground personnel then run over to the vehicle; hop in; and drive off. The tower controller then had another FAA vehicle do a runway inspection the length of the runway and verify that everything was clear of the runway. Once the runway was verified to be clear we were once again cleared for takeoff. We ran the before takeoff checklist below the line again as it had been several minutes since our initial takeoff clearance. We departed ONT without further incident. The controller was very apologetic about the issue. Not sure exactly what happened or where the breakdown was that allowed the vehicle onto the runway without the controller's knowledge. It would have been very very difficult for controller to see the vehicle on the runway from the tower.Some type of breakdown in communication between FAA Ops vehicle/operator and Control Tower. The controller mentioned to us that the vehicle had not been authorized to be on the runway. I believe the operator had been out on the runway changing lights possibly? I do know the vehicle was running though and there was not anybody in the vehicle. Not exactly sure how/why vehicle had gotten out onto the active runway without authorization. Better communication/procedures between Ground Ops/Tower. I also think that if you're going to have vehicles like that on the runway; especially at night; they should be required to have some sort of strobe or beacon light. The vehicle was honestly very hard to see before all of our aircraft lights were on. If the vehicle had been further down the runway; I'm not sure we would have noticed it before we began the takeoff roll.
1933225,After takeoff from Runway XXR at ZZZ; First Officer was flying; he noticed his electric trim was not working. We continued to climb and retract the flaps; to get some altitude to troubleshoot while manually trimming the aircraft. My electric trim refused to work as well. I pulled the checklist for Stab Trim Fail to start working the problem while [the First Officer] controlled the aircraft; and we elected to stop climbing at FL 190. We elected to return to ZZZ; and ATC gave us vectors to return and descend. I alerted Dispatch that we were returning; told the Flight Attendants; and made an announcement over the PA to the Passengers. First Officer continued to fly the aircraft with me assisting with the manual trim; while I got the performance numbers loaded and worked the radios. I briefed the approach to Runway XXR; then took over flying for the final approach and landing. After landing we ran the brake cooling [checklist]; and it indicated that we were good to taxi to the gate.
1917899,Aircraft received landing gear airground fail message on short final. Performed go around; ran QRH; came back to ZZZMaintain vigilance for changing conditions.
1925122,On our go around from [Runway] 19R in Las Vegas we encountered a RA from a departing air carrier. My FO (First Officer) failed to respond in a correct and timely manner so I took control of the aircraft and complied with RA. When I looked outside the window and saw how close the other aircraft was I turned as well to the rear of the plane. I think that the FO did not comply with the RA. Also Tower couldn't give us instructions fast enough to avoid the conflict. Better training.
1891775,During cruise; about an hour after departure; both FMC computers stopped working for about 25 seconds (roughly). The FMC option disappeared from both CDU MENU screens. Both moving maps stopped; all performance data was removed and the autopilot defaulted to CWS roll (as anticipated) when the navigation data became unavailable. We began the process of verify raw data navigation when both FMC computers came back online and proceeded to operate normally. Operationally; we called Operations Control and Maintenance Control and concurred that we were safe to continue. Basic navigation was unaffected and so the safety of flight was not reduced in the event it happened again. However; it does seem to qualify as a serious impact on aircraft systems -- especially since the design redundancy did not work (both sides failed simultaneously). Because the system reset itself normally and did not repeat the fault; it qualified as an INFO-ITEM and the AML entry was made in ZZZ; but the event also appears to qualify as a mandatory report. The description is the same verbiage used in the report. There were no additional factors that indicated the reason that both FMC computers would simultaneous shutdown and then simultaneously restart. No turbulence; we were not interacting with either CDU at the time; nothing. The event is very strange since it caused a breakdown in the 'design through redundancy' principle.Simultaneous failure of redundant systems is a bigger problem than 'an anomaly'. We happened to be in cruise within VOR and VHF range. If this had happened at a more critical time of flight-- where time critical usage of the FMC is greater-- this would have been a larger problem. If this had happened when we were beyond VOR/VHF range; this would have also caused a more serious impact on flight safety. When the FMC computers went offline; we had no access to GPS or IRS navigation data. We also lost all access to FMC performance data. Finding the cause and correcting it appears to be a high priority.
1916103,Early in the boarding process; the B-Flight Attendant came forward a let me know there was a passenger who was cleaning a row of seats with an aerosol spray cleaner. In addition the passenger was verbally difficult when the matter was brought up with her. The Flight Attendant asked for a Customer Service Supervisor. I was able to locate one and requested that she speak with the B-Flight Attendant and the customer to ensure there was not going to be any issues airborne. I was not specific with her about the spray cleaner as I was more concerned that there would be a personality conflict. In addition; throughout this time I was managing two new MELs with Dispatch and Maintenance. Upon completion of that effort; I understood that the issues in back were resolved and we proceeded without incident. Later in the day I asked how the flight had gone with the passenger in question and while they handled the personality clash; no problem we reflected back upon the aerosol issue. It seemed the cleaner was still on the aircraft. I reviewed the FOM and the First Officer reviewed the Company manual. It appeared from that review that the item could have been considered a HAZMAT item that may have been required to be in the checked baggage; vice carry on. What was also noted was [that] there is the HAZMAT Hotline that would have been able to make the proper assessment of the item.
1909769,Air Turn Back. A/C X took off from ZZZ and got engine oil temp alert. Temp went into the red. The Captain followed Quick Reference Handbook and rolled engine back to idle. The temp dropped into Amber. Flight landed back in ZZZ. No request for priority made.
1929726,Practicing power off 180's with Instructor at ZZZ. I did a GUMPS shock midfield; but failed to extend the gear. Once power was set to idle the gear unsafe horn came on; after doing various other power off maneuvers at altitude; my brain ignored the warning horn and I became hyper focused on speed and my landing point. Flew the approach and upon entering into ground effect I noticed something was wrong as the wheels should be touching. I looked down and the horn came back into focus and I caught the error. Immediately added power to initiate a go-around and upon doing so the prop stuck the runway. I was midfield and committed to the go-around at that point and began the climb. I was shaken up so I handed the controls over to my Instructor. The airplane did not indicate any adverse effects; no vibrations and the climb was normal.I have a lot of time in the Arrow and always go a GUMPS check once on downwind and a secondary gear check on final; my failure to comply with my own personal procedure led to this happening. Also I noticed a better glide and that should have been another indication that something was wrong.For the future; I will be sure to continue utilizing a GUMPS check and secondary gear checks as well as adding a third while crossing the threshold and not tuning the gear unsafe horn out. Also I need to be more mindful of becoming hyper complacent in airplanes that I am comfortable with; as well as being impulsive during times of high workloads. For a future abnormal procedure where a landing is aborted in a high stress environment; I need to focus on flying the airplane. I was able to focus to initiate the go around and the climb; but I felt the need to transfer controls after I began to think about what just happened rather than flying the airplane. Lastly; and most importantly I need to be mindful of becoming hyper focused on a few items and be more Thorough with checklist items and keep a good scan going throughout every maneuver.Airplane is grounded and has been reported.
1882701,Aircraft had MEL 34-XX-X and MEL 34-XX-Y. ATL was conducting ILS Runway 26R. I was flying had nav1 signal for LOC 1 with IGXZ on PDF. The LOC became intermittent working and red flag in VMC conditions. Corrected each time but was vectored around for another approach. During this apprise the FO (First Officer) NAV 2 LOC was working. Briefed the changes due to FO will be flying now. When cleared for approach the Flight Director failed and came back. Still VMC and then the FO nav 2 loc 2 went red with red loc flag; which went back to green. Told ATC again there was a problem. Low on fuel we diverted to ZZZ. Discussed with Dispatch. Landed with 1;600 lbs. ATL Approach was very helpful and understanding. Loss of reliability with navigation NAV 1 and NAV 2.
1921391,I was on my break. The purser woke me up and told me that I was needed in the cockpit. I saw that we had offset 5 miles right of course and I was told of the problem. The L ENG OH checklist had been accomplished. When the left throttle was reduced to idle; the L ENG OH message went away. We were between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 on the D track to ZZZ Airport. We [requested priority handling] and received clearance to descend to FL310 and then turn left and proceed directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We made a radio call on XXX.XX stating our position and our planned descent. The L ENG OH checklist came on again on the EICAS. We did the checklist again and this time; when the throttle was reduced to idle; the message did not disappear. We continued the checklist and shut down the left engine. We got clearance to FL200 and we flew directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We communicated with Dispatch; ZZZ Radio; the Flight Attendant's (FA) and made a PA to the passengers. We were given priority vectors to Runway XXR and landed uneventfully.  We taxied clear of the runway and had the Fire Chief look over the plane concentrating on the left engine. We then taxied to Gate XX and shut down.Cause: The L ENG Fire Loop has apparently been replaced 3 sequences prior to our flight. My guess is that it was not completed properly.Suggestions: I don't know how it could have been prevented; but I will say that the training we receive at recurrent is excellent. We performed very well as a team. We discussed things together before executing anything.
1919103,During descent in VMC; the Captain PF (Pilot Flying) asked me; FO (First Officer) PM (Plot Monitoring); to request a VMC descent from Denver Center. Our clearance at the time was to cross the Dunoir DNW VOR at 14;000 ft. I requested the VMC descent from Center. Center asked if we were requesting a Visual Approach and I believe I said yes and they may have said to expect that. Our understanding was that we were cleared to descend VMC. The Captain then began a VMC descent prior to reaching DNW. At approximately 12;700 ft. ATC issued a low altitude alert and told us to climb to 14;000 ft. We told them we were descending VMC to the airport. They asked if we wanted to cancel IFR to which we replied yes. They then said 'IFR cancellation received; squawk VFR; frequency change approved'. We then contacted the JAC Tower; conducted a Visual Approach and landing to Runway 19 with no issues.
1866347,While at Gate XX during heavy wet snow with wind blowing 10-15 kts. 90 degrees from the right side; the APU tripped off line 3 separate times. At some point; we also noticed zero duct pressure. The mechanic found no issues [and] suggested shutting the APU down for several minutes. Upon restart; pressure was normal for approximately 10 minutes; then it started to decrease again. [Contributing factors were] heavy wet snow; [flying] in direct right crosswind; [and] possible issue with design of MAX APU inlet. [I suggest] publishing a note in AOM or somewhere to let crews know this is a possibility on the 737-MAX and have Boeing examine this scenario.
1930163,This was our third leg of the day in Mexico that had numerous immigration issues at all stops. The first leg was a deviation due to thunderstorms over the field and Mexico Approach Control training. We were cleared the Lenul 2A arrival into MMTO. My copilot was on a different frequency verifying we did not have to clear customs now that we were in range and could be heard. Between TO603 and TO604 we were at 15000 [ft.] and the Controller stated 'Cleared direct GAINY descend to 13;000.'  We entered direct GAINY and started the turn and also initiated a descent to 13000. AT 14;200 the Controller asked if we were VMC. We replied no and he told us to climb immediately to 15;000 due to terrain. He then mentioned that we were not cleared to 13;000 until after GAINY.  We climbed to 15;000 and maintained that altitude until he cleared back down to 13;000. Nothing else was mentioned and we were handed off to Tower. Be terrain aware and always double check altitudes if the clearance doesn't make sense. Mexico Controllers phrase clearances and directions slightly different. Take the time to verify instructions.
1870173,We first noticed engine thrust surging during climb through 12;000 ft. The aircraft wasn't climbing at a normal rate. Then through 15;000 ft.; N1 on the number 1 engine was observed to be surging between approx 56% N1 and the climb target N1. We elected to level off at FL 190 to troubleshoot. This was difficult due to the absence of EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System) messages or abnormalities other than the N1 indications. The engine continued surging on and off for roughly 5 minutes between 56% N1 and the cruise target of about 79% before normalizing. A decision to request priority handling was made and along with our Dispatcher we elected to continue to ZZZ. The flight attendants were briefed on the situation. The rest of the flight was normal until initiating the descent at which time the number 1 engine surged again briefly and normalized again throughout the landing roll. Upon rollout ENG 1 NO DISPATCH EICAS message illuminated. The MX logbook entries were made and MX personnel met the aircraft at the Gate. I'll note that 2 MELs were present on the aircraft; ENG 1 short dispatch and engine 1 bleed system.
1900299,Air quality incident.
1876950,First Felt like Left Tire Went Flat. (tire was not Flat). Next nose gear went down. Propeller Hit Ground. plane stopped.
1909164,We received a clearance for a visual approach to [Runway] 35L with direct to the FAF.  I was monitoring our class B floor to ensure compliance and the FO was flying 250 knots. I stepped down his altitude as required to remain in class B. ATC  told us the airspeed was our discretion. As we approached the final marker we were high and fast.  We did not intercept the glide slope at the marker and used vertical speed to continue. At 500 feet we were stable; but I did not get our flaps to 30.  I did not hear a call and we were focused on salvaging the approach. The GPWS said 'terrain' and I thought this was an error. At 50 feet I noticed the flap gauge at 25. Our Vref was 164 knots due to gusts.  Clearly we should have gone around and I offer no excuse.
1898630,Departing APV Runway 18; I left traffic pattern westward in the upwind following Aircraft Y also departing. Immediate west departure was for safety as additional aircraft were attempting left downwind entry of 18 at APV. Nearly immediately after turning west; I received a terrain advisory on a garment 430 NAV. The warning would not clear and I continued to follow departing traffic as I was clear of terrain but between two hills southwest of APV. For safety; I continued to focus on climbing to altitude and departing traffic rather than continue to clear the warning from the 430.I noticed I was in VCV airspace when followed departing traffic began to descend and I looked down to see an aviation boneyard. I immediately turned east to vacate the airspace and began to clear terrain message to obtain VCV Tower frequency. Although; VCV's airspace was not 'busy'; my concern is that the persistent terrain message can make it difficult for pilots to identify Class D airspace and be problematic if airspace is more congested.
1905145,We took off XX in Aircraft X. At about 1200 AGL there was a shutter similar to an ECU swap but more intense. This was accompanied by a power decrease to 63%. The airspeed dropped from 88 to 83. I then took controls; leveled off; and asked ATC to land on XL. I made a tight downwind and base for XL.
1869805,I was conducting an initial Part 141 check for a flight instructor. We requested a Northbound departure and were assigned Runway XXR. Once on a northbound heading we were given a traffic alert from ZZZ Tower for traffic at our 1 o'clock position. We lowered the nose slightly to gain visual.  The traffic passed below us on a Westerly heading. ZZZ Tower informed us the aircraft was with ZZZ1 Approach executing a missed approach from Runway XXR. [The difference in our altitude] was 2;700 ft. MSL [for our flight] and the other aircraft was 2;500 ft. MSL.
1892471,On the ILS XXL approach into ZZZ; I was Pilot Flying and my First Officer was Pilot Monitoring. At approx 2;500 feet in descent we received an EICAS (engine indicating and crew alerting system) Slat Fail. The First Officer also mentioned he had a loud pop. I elected to discontinue the approach and perform a go around. Once leveled off; I transferred flight controls to the PM (FO) and ran the Slat Fail QRH (quick reference handbook). ZZZ gave us delays vectors while running the QRH. There seemed to be confusion between us and ATC. I think they thought we had a flight control malfunction despite stating we had a slat malfunction. They then [assigned priority handling] on their behalf and we gave SOB and FOB. The slats were stuck at 1 but flaps were able to be extended to 5 for landing. After running the QRH; I took back the flight controls to perform the landing. After landing we exited the runway and had the ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting) trucks perform an inspection on the right wing to verify there wasn't any damage to the wing that would prevent taxi back to the gate.
1905852,On departure at FL240; had HYD G RSVR LO LVL ECAM message followed by associated low pressure and other hydraulic messages. Completed ECAM actions and follow ups. Requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ for overweight landing on Runway XXR. Gravity gear extension required. Landed 24;900 pounds overweight. Uneventful landing and cleared the runway. After ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) inspected aircraft; taxied to the gate. There were no causal factors; just mechanical failure. As this incident was caused by mechanical failure; there is nothing I can suggest that would prevent this type of event from occurring in the future. However; it is worth noting that due to good policies; procedures and crew coordination; the event was handled in a superior manner.
1901122,During training flight with instructor. On short final for XXR into ZZZ; 'gear pump on' indicated but 3 green (gear down; not in transit) also shown. Additionally; 'Gear NOT down' auditory message came on when throttles were brought to idle. Performed low approach to determine if gear was down at all - which Tower confirmed was down. During return to final; trouble shot in order to determine any false indications; gear not locked; or other issues. None were found; approach was continued; [priority handling was requested] as precaution for possible faulty landing gear system. Landing performed as normal with no abnormalities except for 'gear NOT down' auditory message sounding.
1896041,I had just received a position relief briefing from the Controller being relieved and was told that Aircraft X was IFR and was going to be executing the published missed approach to KREEN but will want their IFR clearance to JRF. Shortly after taking the position; Aircraft X checked in stating that they were climbing VFR and wanting to pick up their IFR to JRF at 7;000 ft. I then asked the pilot to verify that they were canceling IFR and going to proceed VFR at this time. The pilot responded that they wanted IFR at this time. I then asked the pilot if they were on the published missed approach and the pilot advised that they were flying runway heading at this time. I advised the pilot that you understood that he was assigned the published missed approach procedure to KREEN. The pilot advised they were not issued anything and was just told to contact you on departure. I then pulled up the EOVM map and vectored Aircraft X to a heading of 055 for terrain. Then I went back and told Aircraft X to climb and maintain 4;000 ft. since the missed approach only would climb to 3;000 ft. and I knew I would need Aircraft X at 4;000 ft. to the east of LIH for his IFR. Aircraft X was apparently in the 7;000 ft. MIA when I issued climb and maintain 4;000 ft. Aircraft X was only out of 2;400 ft. and climbing when he reached the 4;000 ft. MIA 50 seconds later. Eventually; I issued Aircraft X their IFR clearance back to JRF once they were mid channel. I don't have any recommendations for this instance.
1870392,On Departure off of Runway 17R in DFW on the AKUNA9 SID; the FO (First Officer) side Radar Altimeter (RA) displayed a flag; and the Captain side RA displayed roughly 200-300 ft. higher than the FO side. This flag was displayed for approximately 5-10 seconds; and then resumed as normal. The first indication of an anomaly occurred around 2;000 ft. MSL; or 1;500 AGL. Possible 5G interference departing DFW. Delay implementation of 5G service until all issues with radar altimeters and transport category aircraft have been dealt with.
1921310,During departure climb through FL230 we experienced a loud bang/pop originating in the nose section of the aircraft immediately followed by a significant increase in volume of air rushing through the cockpit. Notified ATC; stopped the climb at FL280; checked that the aircraft was maintaining cabin altitude/pressurization; it was. Prior to push back we had to have the sensor on the avionics access door deferred per MEL. This coupled with the extremely loud sound of moving air in the cockpit; which was originating in the avionics bay (I opened the floor access door in the cockpit and verified there was no significant movement of air) we determined that the avionics door was still at least partially latched and that a possible door seal failure had occurred. Which was the case. A second pop was experienced with a momentary cabin rate of climb increase to 700 FPM. Contacted Dispatcher; decided to air turn back to ZZZ. Notified Maintenance. Vectored back to ILS [Runway] XX. No emergency declared or crash fire and rescue alerted. Uneventful descent and landing into ZZZ.Cause - Door seal failure; Avionics Access Door.
1869402,Trigger...at FL380 was given descent to FL340. At approximately FL360; the CAB PRESS status page displayed showing a cabin altitude of 9;500 feet and rising. Action requested priority handling with ZZZ ATC; started rapid descent to 10;000 feet; seat belt sign on. First Officer (FO) and pilot flying; performed a maneuver with the autopilot on. ATC gave us initial descent to FL270 and a frequency change. New Controller gave us descent to 10;000 feet with altimeter setting of 29.80. We were in VFR conditions; minimum safe altitude from charts approximately 5;000 feet. FO was able to descend quickly enough that a CABIN ALTITUDE ECAM did not trigger nor did the oxygen masks deploy in the cabin. I was able to speak with FA1; during the descent. FA1 confirmed that passengers were okay and did not report any injuries but would update us if something changed. I made a PA to passengers about aircraft condition and plan of action. Requested all to remain seated until in ZZZ.After level off and confirming aircraft was safe to continue; removed the aircraft alert from ZZZ ATC; but requested priority handling into ZZZ. Sent ACARS message to Dispatch. Stated our problem; action; current situation and plan. Received acknowledgment and new fuel remaining calculation for Denver at 10;000 feet. Highest cabin altitude was 11;350 feet. No ECAMs showed on the upper display. Outflow valve; inlet and extract vents all showed closed. During level off; safety valve opened when cabin diff pressure at -.5 PSI. Remaining flight was uneventful to a landing at ZZZ; XXR. Taxi to Gate at XX. Met by ZZZ maintenance and ZZZ FO representative.
1895477,VFR conditions. I was the PF (Pilot Flying); FO (First Officer) was the PM (Pilot Monitoring). PM had initially set the ILS 36R in the FMC as a back up to the briefed visual approach. Prior to waypoint BOWTZ (the final waypoint on the arrival with a 4000 ft. crossing altitude); ATC gave clearance to descend to 2000 ft. PF selected Level Change; verified with PM and continued descent. Captain (PF) then asked FO to request the RNAV A Approach as a backup for the briefed visual approach. ATC cleared us the RNP Z 36R Approach. RNAV approach was loaded in FMC and briefed as the backup to the visual approach. Prior to the IAF waypoint (BOWTZ); I failed to select/ confirm VNAV; leaving the vertical mode in Level Change. I then set zeros in the MCP altitude window thinking more of a visual approach verses the RNP. At waypoint MYOPE; Tower called a low altitude alert. We were at 1800 ft. MSL with a minimum of 2200 ft. at MYOPE per the approach plate. Vertical deviation was immediately corrected and the approach/landing was continued uneventfully. Weather was clear and we were visual with the field the entire approach. [Automation Management] breakdown with Pilot-to-Pilot communication. There was some initial distractions with Approach Control having difficulty understanding FO's radio transmission saying the radio was scratchy; resulting in a brief discussion between the FO and me on transmission clarity. PM was also distracted with a frequency change that disrupted [Automation Management] as well as the late change to the RNP backup versus the ILS. PF complicated a simple visual approach by task loading the PM with the late ILS to RNP backup. [Automation Management] must be brought to a conclusion despite interruptions and distractions and additive conditions. Minimize the risk by planning and sticking to the plan. I take full responsibility for late changes; task loading and not using [Automation Management] to its entirety.
1899769,We were on the ZZZZZ1 arrival into ZZZ and set up for the ILS Z XXR. After passing ZZZZZ2; we were told to fly present heading and descend and maintain 3000 ft. MSL. As we approached the river; I began to slow to 190 KIAS and asked for Flaps 8 because I felt we were being vectored in close to ZZZZZ3. We asked approach if we could get lower because we were being vectored in between ZZZZZ4 and ZZZZZ3 at 3000 ft. Approach told us to turn to 020; descend and maintain 1800 ft. MSL; cleared for the VISUAL XXR approach. I set 1800 ft. in the altitude select and began my descent while I turned to 020. Because we were cleared for the approach; I activated Approach Mode. The LOC and glideslope (GS) captured immediately on my side. I thought this was strange because we were still intercepting the LOC; and we were above the GS. The aircraft turned to approximately a 050 but did not appear to capture the LOC even though the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) showed captured. The aircraft also began to pitch nose down and began a steep descent. The Captain (CA) announced I needed to get under the GS for it to capture because his side still showed LOC and GS armed; not captured. As I was trying to diagnose the problem; the airspeed began to rise. The CA announced it and deployed the Flight Spoilers to arrest the descent. I tried to use Vertical Speed mode to shallow the descent; but it did not work. At approximately 235 KIAS; the flap over speed clacker was heard. Shortly after; the 'Glideslope' alert was heard then the 'Terrain; Terrain; Pull Up' was heard as the autopilot was disengaged and a go around was initiated. The CA contacted approach; and they told us to turn to 360 and climb to 2000 ft. We were vectored around and tried the approach again; entering from the north. Approach told us to turn to 130 and intercept the XXR LOC. I engaged NAV mode; and the autopilot did not turn in time so we began to fly through the LOC. I engaged Heading Mode and corrected the course. Once on-course; I reengaged NAV mode and the LOC captured successfully. We were cleared for the Visual XXR a second time; and I engaged Approach mode; and it captured the GS successfully. Once on the ground; we contacted maintenance about the flap over speed; and the Autopilot anomalies. Maintenance decided to defer the Autopilot; and we remained on the aircraft for 2 additional legs (ZZZ-ZZZ1 & ZZZ1-ZZZ). On the next leg; we flew the RNAV XY into ZZZ1; but experienced similar LOC and GS issues coming back into ZZZ on XXR. The CA flew ZZZ1-ZZZ and was on the ZZZZZ1 and ILS Z XXR. As we approached the XXR LOC from the south; we noticed the GS indicator was fluctuating almost full scale up and down. He was given a heading to intercept the XXR LOC in between ZZZZZ4 and ZZZZZ3; and with just the Flight Director; the aircraft started to fly through the LOC again. He caught it and flew raw data until on course. Once cleared for the approach; he engaged approach mode and was able to capture the LOC and GS. At first; we thought the gusty winds made it hard for the autopilot to capture the LOC and GS. The winds were 040/14G23 initially and 050/20G27 when we landed. However; when the CA flew his leg back into ZZZ; the winds weren't as bad; and the autopilot wasn't used. There were still large fluctuations in the GS but never any red flags or missing data. The Flight Director was displaying inaccurate data which caused the autopilot to make the wrong inputs. After landing back in ZZZ the second time; the CA called maintenance and decided to upgrade the MEL due to safety of flight. If this same situation had happened in IMC; it would have been much harder to identify as opposed to under VMC. I think the LOC and GS capture was a false capture. Because I devoted too much time trying to diagnose why it was a false capture; I didn't observe the rapid descent. Once I noticed something was wrong; I should have disengaged the Autopilot and hand flown. This would have been safer thanrelying on automation.
1906938,ZZZ ILS Z XXR During ILS Z approach to ZZZ Runway XXR; the G650ER was slightly below GS just after passing DH; inbound to land on Runway XXR. Crew was likely task saturated while practicing a 'simulated' EFVS (Enhance Flight Vision System) approach to TD/Rollout in VMC and may have lost some situational awareness resulting in EGPWS Mode V activation. Crew had recently completed initial EFVS TD/RO simulator training course and annual recurrent training and sought the training benefit/objective of 'real-world' application of newly learned procedures; practice somewhat confusing call-outs; and actual decision making in a live environment; given the opportunity of good weather and somewhat familiar airport. One interesting takeaway is that it is rather confusing to do EFVS simulated procedures in VMC/daylight while simulator training is done in simulated LIFR/night conditions.After aircraft passed DH; and; as PM may correctly recall; on a normal descent profile; the PF became slightly low on GS while referencing HUD 3.0 degree down FPA guidance. PM (self) did not detect the initial GS deviation as he was focusing too much awareness on identification of 'EVS Runway' lighting which takes place at 100' barometric above TDZE. *Note: Runway lights were not illuminated/daytime/VMC.  GPWS Mode V 'Glideslope' audible warning sounded and PF took immediate corrective action. A normal landing followed. Not much thought had been given at the time as there was no perception of hazard by the crew during debrief.  Several other interesting/distracting events (consistent with normal ops in the [metro] area) occurred earlier in the flight including a TCAS TAs during the ZZZZZ. ZZZZZ1 SID and just prior to commencing GS capture on ILS Z XXR. PM recalls delayed automated capture of the ILS Z XXR GS about this same time during the earlier stage of the approach. PM does not recall at this point in time (11 days later); if the A/P was coupled/re-coupled.
1931983,On Day; I was the Second-In-Command on a Part-91 Ferry operation flying a SF-340 from ZZZ to ZZZZ operating on a special flight permit. The aircraft was released for flight by Company X. On the flight; I was the pilot flying and the Pilot-In-Command was the pilot monitoring. METAR was (W) reporting 140/08 10SM; light rain; 700 OVC. I always include in my takeoff briefing should I notice an irregularity; I would call it and let the PIC make the decision for abort or continue. During takeoff at approximately V1; the right engine Torque (TQ) increased to 108%. (Maximum power in the Saab 340B with CTOT-engaged is 100% TQ. CTOT is a device on the aircraft to set desired Torque for takeoff and go-around; Constant Torque on Takeoff. When this occurred I called Right Torque 108%; the Captain said to continue the takeoff and take the aircraft airborne. As soon as we were airborne; the right engine Torque decreased to 40% TQ causing a right yawing moment. (In the Saab 340; if the power lever is pulled back with the CTOT engaged the torque will decrease to approximately 40%). I pushed both power levers forward and grabbed the yoke to maintain directional control. The PIC requested to return to the field and ZZZ Tower gave us left traffic pattern. We leveled out at 3000 ft MSL (around 1500 ft AGL) in IMC and turned the CTOT off. Once the CTOT was switched off the TQ on right engine returned to its previous power setting of 80% TQ (making us believe there was a malfunction with the CTOT). Both Power Levers were then reduced to around 60% TQ. The PIC requested vectors back to land since we were in IMC.We were unable to fly an RNAV approach as the GPS database did not have approaches installed. The PIC requested vectors for the ILS Runway XX in ZZZ. While on vectors to intersect the localizer; both NAV 1 and NAV 2 radios failed and were unable to capture the localizer; glide slope; or VOR/DME. I verified the frequency was correct and approach mode was on. Tower asked our intentions since we overshot the approach course. The PIC requested vectors to an airport with VFR weather. We were given a heading (west) to avoid weather and were transferred to ZZZ Center however; we weren't able to make contact. I tuned in to ZZZ VOR and ZZZ1 VOR to trouble shoot the Nav radios. We received conflicting readings with DME and radials so we confirmed it was a NAV failure and not a station failure. Another aircraft on the same frequency was able to relay messages back and forth for us to ZZZ Center. After climbing to 4;000 ft and out of weather; we were able to speak with Center. The Captain had comms and informed ATC of engine malfunction and lost navigation. Center informed us they had [given us priority] and vectored us south to ZZZ2. I descended the aircraft to 2000 ft to get below the cloud layer and executed a visual approach to Runway XY. I landed the aircraft in ZZZ2 with no further incident.
1906846,I was on my third circuit of the landing pattern for Runway 5 on downwind when Aircraft Y from local flight school says he was entering the pattern on a 45 degree when crossed in front of me descending through my altitude. This is a common occurrence at this airport. All attempts to have a tower installed have failed.
1915468,Performing a #2 service on Aircraft X; found door 2R emergency exit light assembly not installed. Further troubleshooting discovered the area had been panlamed over. Gained access to lower panel of aft galley and found wires dangling. Had to order new lite assembly to install and hook up wiring. Similar to Aircraft Y which had same problem 2 days earlier.
1903140,On taxi in at ZZZ; the number 2 engine flamed out. On approach we got an Auto Fuel Feed Fault ECAM. I elected to continue the approach. We had 6.3 in the Center tank; 1.4 in the Right Inner; and 7.9 in the Outer tank. The flow bar was absent on the right outer and there was no 'OFF' indication on the outer tank isolation valve. The outer tank isolation valve was discovered closed with no OFF indication. This was verified on block in. We shut down the other engine as we were on the ramp and I had us towed into the gate. Auto Fuel Feed Fault coupled with Rt Outer Isolation Valve closed with no 'OFF' warning. Be more vigilant with respect to fuel system.
1878386,Hour and a half out of ZZZ get an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) that comes and immediately goes away. What was that? Then it came back for a little longer: HYD G RSVR LO LVL. And quickly goes away. HYD system page shows low green quantity; just above the amber range. ECAM comes back and stays on. Run ECAM actions; QRH; discuss our understanding together; talk with Dispatch and MX (Maintenance) Control; inform ATC of situation; requesting special handing by ZZZ Tower due to no nose wheel steering after landing; brief inflight and customers. Inflight code yellow; as normal landing expected; except for stopping on runway; and tug to gate. Landed uneventfully on Runway XXL. Super tug to gate; ZZZ MX noted large amounts of hydraulic fluid in gear bay.
1882701,Aircraft had MEL 34-XX-X and MEL 34-XX-Y. ATL was conducting ILS Runway 26R. I was flying had nav1 signal for LOC 1 with IGXZ on PDF. The LOC became intermittent working and red flag in VMC conditions. Corrected each time but was vectored around for another approach. During this apprise the FO (First Officer) NAV 2 LOC was working. Briefed the changes due to FO will be flying now. When cleared for approach the Flight Director failed and came back. Still VMC and then the FO nav 2 loc 2 went red with red loc flag; which went back to green. Told ATC again there was a problem. Low on fuel we diverted to ZZZ. Discussed with Dispatch. Landed with 1;600 lbs. ATL Approach was very helpful and understanding. Loss of reliability with navigation NAV 1 and NAV 2.
1921210,Moderate wake turbulence event during second segment climb beginning at 1200 ft. AGL. Followed B757 on takeoff. Had three separate roll events of 30 degrees to both the left and right. Two minute takeoff separation for following B757 should be re-instituted.
1898596,My student and I announced our takeoff; crosswind; and our downwind for the runway at an uncontrolled field. There was one plane short final for the runway. A Luscombe announced one mile out crossing midfield. I then asked if they were planning on going behind us as we were already on downwind. They said traffic no factor; possibly confusing us with the aircraft landing. I then told them they were headed right at us as they were crossing mid field. They then said they do not have us in sight. We were right in front of them and lower than them as they approached the traffic pattern almost t-boning us. I asked him if he was planning on slowing down and getting space between us as we were ahead and lower than him. He still said he did not have us in sight. He continued to fly right on top and slightly behind us even as I told him we were turning base and he should extend downwind to create that spacing. He was careless; not paying attention to radio calls; and very complacent with not searching for traffic even though we were right in front of him if he would've just looked. After looking up the pilot on the FAA website; his last medical was [many years ago] and does not have basic med.
1874185,After takeoff from ZZZ; the FA's (Flight Attendant) reported a chemical/exhaust smell and a brief period of a haze in the cabin. Both of the items soon disappeared; but we were able to briefly smell a exhaust type smell briefly in the cockpit as well. As we started the descent into ZZZ1 and the power levers retarded to idle thrust; the odor returned and was reported by the rear FA's but without a haze report this time. The odor was faintly noticeable in the cockpit and would dissipate quickly once the power levels were returned to a greater than idle power setting. After landing and upon gate arrival; I consulted with the FA's and decided the aircraft was to be written up for a smoke/odor/fume event. The FA's met with their respective Flight Service managers and were evaluated by EMT's at the airport. The EMT's instructed the FA's to seek further medical attention. At that point; the FA's left the airport for the hospital to be further evaluated. The FO (First Officer) and I decided that we did not need medical attention. Our aircraft was taken out of service and eventually cancelled due to lack of cabin crew.The aircraft had been sitting in ZZZ for 24 hours with constant rain. My guess is certain areas that get hot following application of bleed air may have steamed off latent oil and/or other fluids that may have been ingested into the packs.[I suggest] more aircraft maintenance that revolves around preventative care of the aircraft.
1875781,On approach into LAX at 2;500 feet we had a near mid air with a large yellow drone. It passed just below and left of the nose/wing. We notified ATC and landed normally. Post flight inspection by both pilots and maintenance showed no impact.
1890242,Aircraft Y was shooting a practice VOR-A approach into AUO under VFR conditions. Weather was clear; no ceiling; visibility unrestricted; light winds and no turbulence. Aircraft Y called he was crossing midfield to enter left downwind for Runway 18 at AUO. Aircraft X was departing Runway 18 at AUO. Instead of crossing midfield at the prescribed 500 ft. above Traffic Pattern Altitude; crossed midfield at 500 ft. below Traffic Pattern Altitude. Aircraft X was forced to stop climb as evasive action to avoid a collision with Aircraft Y. ADS-B data reported a vertical separation of less than 300 ft. as the airplanes crossed each other's paths over midfield.
1877527,New Hire Student First Officer on initial operating experience has bounced landing due to lack of feel of aircraft approaching ground during the landing phase of flight. On go-around; the student applied max thrust and relaxed back stick pressure causing the aircraft to point at the ground requiring Instructor to take controls to avoid ground impact and execute go-around procedure. Student inability to identify aircraft closure rate with ground to start aircraft flare on time; resulting in bounced landing. Instructor Response; have a training event that focuses specifically on balked landings and go-around during simulator training for First Officers prior to releasing students to the line for initial operating experience. Implement a policy for initial operating experience students to return to simulator for specific landing practice if not on track to complete initial operating experience by the 50 hour point due to deficiencies in landing the aircraft.
1879052,During initial climb; passing about 8000 feet an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) Cargo Smoke Warning occurred; but then quickly stopped and went away. However; the last page; only; of the ECAM Actions for cargo smoke was displayed on the STS (Status) page. Moments later; passing through about 10000 feet the same warning recurred and again stopped and vanished. The STS continued to display the same last page.Since we [were] coasting-out and were unable to determine whether or not we were on fire; and unable to determine if the warning was for the for the forward or aft cargo compartment; I transferred aircraft control and ATC communications responsibilities to the First Officer; with the command to request priority handling and return to the departure airport ASAP.We each completed our divided duties and re-joined as a crew; so to speak; on about a 10 mile final. Although we were about 21;000 pounds above maximum landing weight; First Officer rolled the aircraft onto the runway as smooth as could be and brought us to a stop on the center line. I found the procedure of calling 'My Aircraft' and the onset of both warnings very helpful. And the method of dividing responsibilities; i.e.; 'Your aircraft; your radios' to serve us perfectly as well.
1909840,Broken Stab R2 brake assembly removed and stowed in flight deck. Please review MEL XX-XX-X and XX-XX-X. The stabilizer has two EMCU (Electric Motor Control Unit) units L2 and R2. Their inputs are single path summed inputs to the HTAS (Horizontal Trimmable Stabilizer System) (Company name for the jack screw that moves the horizontal stabilizer). This MEL allows one of the two to be inoperable (and requires the entire EMCU and brake assembly to be removed); and for the plane to fly 10 flights before being fixed with no restrictions (such as no ETOPS; etc). In the last several years a high proportion of fatal aviation crashes have involved broken stabilizers or jack screws. A single failure of the remaining control unit (but breaking in a different way than unanticipated by Boeing) could create a very difficult to control airplane. The backup for the remaining stabilizer control unit is the elevators to provide pitch control--but they could be fighting against a non-faired stabilizer and CG both moving in the same direction against them. Issues with MEL: 1. Only a single failure of the other EMCU stabilizer motor control brake unit could create a priority situation. While the elevators could still control pitch; the non normal checklist for stabilizer requires a flaps 20 landing because elevators alone may be insufficient to overcome an out of position stabilizer. An example of this scenario is where the plane is loaded with an aft CG requiring nose down trim on the nose down limit for takeoff (what we had) and the stabilizer assembly breaks on transition from climb to cruise and locks in the climb attitude. You would have two strong forces pitching the nose up and the smaller elevator surfaces to bring it down again. Additionally this stabilizer position would create parasitic drag and increase fuel burn.2. Unlike other parts on the plane (for example the center fuel pumps; each of which can fully fuel both engines); the stabilizer control units are each designed for only half the load/work of moving the horizontal stabilizer. This is called single path summed inputs design. This is evidenced by the fact the trim rate drops to half with the MEL. When you remove a part of system and leave the remaining parts under a heavier than normal strain they are likely to break earlier and different than they otherwise might have. For connected systems the failure of one component can often cause damage to any attached system elements because as one brake assembly is breaking it is putting greater than normal load and strain on the remaining unit and everything else attached to it. The fact that this MEL could allow 100 hours plus of flight time on the remaining stabilizer assembly is increasing the chance that it breaks. Any wear statistics on the stabilizer assemblies are based on both working in concert each taking half the load. Does Boeing really have failure data on a single assembly? Especially flown over 100 hours; and after the other one was breaking first?3. Dispatch over ETOPS compounds the problems a single failure could create. Parasitic drag of the stabilizer could increase fuel burn. Alternates are far away.4. The EMCU R2 was removed and placed in the flight deck and not tied down. So created a hazard for the pilots.
1882861,During our approach into ZZZ; we where given the RNAV GPS XX; using high LPV minimums. During the brief we added in a 2 mile fix around the FAF to give us visual awareness for the 'GPS APPROACH' callout. Our initial ATIS information we received called for 10 miles of visibility; high winds and a ceiling of 6500 ft. As we descended through the STAR and vectors to the GPS approach; weather was rapidly deteriorating. On final approach we descended down to 1700 ft. and the next altitude was of 800 ft. was set. Once approaching the 2 mile point the GPS approach was called and I started a vertical descent of 700 fpm mistaking it for the 0.2NM descent. With Windshear and poor visibility; I was focused on maintain proper airspeed to ensure no over speed occurred. The Captain was making sure we had forward visibility and when he glanced back into the cockpit he noticed we were below the snowflake. At the time we were approaching 1100 ft. and ATC made an altitude alert call. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and rejoined the snowflake and continued down on a 700 fpm descent following the guidance.No contact of the runway environment was made and a go-around was initiated. On the go-around ATC noted that multiple aircraft have gone around at this point. During this time a new ATIS had come out with a visibility of 1 1/2SM. We didn't realize this until after making it on the ground. ATC was giving weather updates stating that improving visibility was from the viewpoint of the Tower but no actual visibility was stated as well as ceiling updates. We went around and made a second attempt using the GPS XX approach and made contact with the runway environment and landed. With the favorable weather conditions upon the original ATIS information; we had an expectation bias that the weather was going to be good upon landing. Poor visibility due to dropping weather conditions and high winds caused a high workload environment. We set up a 2 mile fix around the FAF; ZZZZZ; to remind us to call out 'GPS APPROACH' callout. I mistakenly mistook the 2 mile distance from the FAF for the 0.2 mile distance to initiate the descent. With both the CA (Captain) and I in a high workload situation in poor weather conditions; the callout for 'VS' was unchecked even though the confirmation of 'VS' was made. The distraction wind shear and monitoring the airspeed caused me to not fully check the distance correctly from the FAF. This brought the aircraft to descend too early and caused the low altitude callout from ATC. Another error of the cause was a lack of experience on my part; this was my second GPS approach in a real aircraft in weather conditions. A go-around should have been made instead of continuing the approach even though forward visibility was there when we received the Low Altitude Alert. Had we known the visibility an approach into ZZZ1 would have been more reasonable. Even though the checklist for the GPS approach was briefed; it probably would have been good to go over it again once closer to the airport to ensure all callouts and actions are properly made. An ILS approach would have given us more visual awareness and a reduced workload. Checking the automatic ATIS update prior to making the second attempt. Another suggestion would be to review familiarize myself with GPS approaches more so since I have only done two at this point.
1910841,When the flight crew arrived at the aircraft; it had been towed from the maintenance hangar sometime in the middle of the night before our departure. During preflight; the Captain noticed the Gear Pins were missing from the cockpit and the FO reported after his preflight walk around that they were still installed in the Landing Gear. The AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) showed that the Gear Pins had been removed and stowed the night prior by employee NUMBER. The Captain contacted OPS on the radio ad well as Maintenance Control by telephone; and entered the discrepancy in the AML . The local ZZZ OPS sent a newly hired ramper who immediately removed the three gear pins; and rushed them to the cockpit. The ramp agent did not know where they belonged in the cockpit or how to store them. He was also not trained or authorized to make any entries in the AML. The CA discussed the issue with the ramp agent; an operations agent; and the Maintenance Representative who later arrived at the airplane. All three stated that there is an ongoing issue at ZZZ where ramp teams tow aircraft from the maintenance hangar to the gates in the morning with zero representation from the maintenance team.These ramp tow teams have been performing unauthorized maintenance on the aircraft by installing and removing gear pins without properly logging such activities in the AML. The Ramp agent and Maintenance agent expressed that this was at least the third instance of an aircraft being released to a flight crew with installed Gear Pins (and no AML logging) in the last week. Maintenance verified the Gear Pins were properly removed and stowed; and then signed off the AML while the FO performed a new preflight walk-around inspection. Ramp Agents are performing unscheduled and undocumented Gear Pin installations on aircraft. This greatly and significantly increases the chances of an aircraft launching with the Gear Pins installed. The 'Swiss cheese holes' are lining up! Immediately stop the ZZZ ramp crews from towing aircraft without properly documenting when they have installed the Gear Pins. Provide training to all ZZZ operations managers and ramp agents on the importance of proper procedures; AML logging; and the dangers of an aircraft launching with Gear Pins installed.
1896666,Electrical problem whereby entire avionics system and engine lost power temporarily; then intermittently until landing. Headed straight in to ZZZ. Configured aircraft for best glide. Initial thoughts were battery/alternator problems (Have 2 Alternators and 2 Batteries); but avionics were in the process of rebooting so could not observe Voltage/Amperage at first. Avionics rebooted; and began emergency procedures: Battery Voltages Green; Alternators producing voltage/amperage; all Circuit breakers in; switched to ECU 2 (backup ECU) and Fuel Pump 2; switch fuel tanks. Radios came up; called into ZZZ Unicom and advised local traffic that I was having problems and coming in on a right base for Runway XX. Noticed there was power lines running across my path to Runway XX; observed to ensure clearance. Resumed diagnosis; and deduced might be the Electronic Bus Mgr. upon which time engaged the Emergency Bus Bypass switch which routes direct power to the Buses. Reached over and Pulled RPM control (Prop pitch) back to reduce drag and began slight turn to line up with Runway XX once Power Lines were cleared. At 300 ft. AGL; had runway made and continued reduced power descent. Dropped landing gear; received Green Light on Nose; but not Mains. Was now at about 50 ft. AGL and just about to cross threshold. Pumped emergency gear pump a couple of times and noticed the Emergency Bus Bypass switch was back in the off position. Quickly flipped it on again and dropped full flaps. Engine began to come alive again and thought for a moment that I should do a go around and work on gear; but decided that I had runway made and wasn't sure that problem was totally fixed. Decided continued landing was smartest/safest bet.Touched down at 65 kts.; soft landing; but Mains had not locked out and retracted back into wells. Nose Gear remained down and aircraft settled on rear tie down skid under tail. Shut engine down to avoid prop strike if Nose Gear happened to give way. Continued down runway with no braking (brakes are on Mains) and limited rudder authority. As aircraft slowed to about 20 kts.; lost rudder authority and aircraft slowly veered to left side of Runway XX and came to full stop about 25 ft. in soft turf at which point the nose gear retracted and aircraft sat down on belly.Damage incurred:Minor repairable abrasions on belly and Tail skid section.Nose Gear Hydraulic Cylinder brokeOne of Three prop blades damaged when nose gear retracted at stop; unrepairable remaining blades and hub no damage.Time from Occurrence to landing = 3 mins
1921319,We had a PACK INOP on take off out of ZZZ on Aircraft X. We transferred the bleeds from the APU to the engines when we got a Left PACK High Press Caution Message. We ran the QRH at 3;000 ft. and the Caution Message continued. We then proceeded to the unpressurized flight QRH and completed that. At that time cabin temp was 32 Degrees C; and we were close to reserve fuel landing in ZZZ1. We deemed the safest option was to go back to ZZZ. Cause: Complex single pack operations. QRH was vague in stating that if the High pressure caution message continues that the Pilot should then proceed to the unpressurized flight QRH.
1935688,We took off Runway XX out of ZZZ. I was the Pilot Flying (PF). Climbing out of 7;000 ft. we experienced a loud bang; accompanied by severe shaking and vibrations. After a second bang; I looked at the engine indications and saw the right engine was surging severely. I suspected a compressor stall.  I immediately shallowed our climb; pulled the thrust lever to idle and the compressor stall went away with normal engine indications at idle. The Captain (CA) initiated a request for priority handling with ZZZ Approach; and we leveled off at 8;000 ft. We ran the ECAM procedure and pulled out the QRH for Engine Stall. We ran it and tried several times advancing the thrust lever; and the compressor stall returned every time. We left the thrust lever at idle; ran the single-engine approach procedures and told ATC we were diverting to ZZZ2. I continued being the PF and flew the ILS to [Runway] YYR. The landing was uneventful; and we exited the runway. As we began exiting the runway the engine auto-shutdown and displayed an Engine Stall ECAM. I transferred control to the Captain; ran the ECAM procedure; and we came to a stop. Airport Rescue & Firefighting checked over the aircraft and the right engine and saw no abnormal indications. We taxied to Gate XXX and disembarked the passengers as normal.No factors played a role in this from the flight crew. All indications and procedures were normal up to this point.No suggestions; this was a mechanical issue.
1899756,We were on X country dual time building flight ZZZ to ZZZ1. During preflight we noticed oil level was very low around 1 quartz; so we added 6 quarts during preflight. After ground check was normal; we taxied to Runway XX. When holding; the alternator amps where at zero; volts where at 23; and battery amps where at zero; even when alternator where turn off the battery amps went negative (troubleshoot was unsuccessful). Also; oil temperature indicated 235 Fahrenheit (almost touching the red range). We requested Tower to taxi back to ramp. While taxing back we also experienced issues with hand brake. After returning safely to ramp; airplane was squawked for all the issues noted.
1909109,I had experienced an alternator failure enroute from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and made a precautionary landing at ZZZ2. A local retired A&P assisted in checking the airplane and removing the battery. I had called my local A&P and he flew a C-210 and brought a 24 volt charger and charged the battery. It was expected the battery would have enough charge to make sure that I had lights to land. I took off; with my passenger; a private pilot. We wanted to get as much daylight as possible. We had agreed prior that I would fly at 2;500 ft. and the C-210 would fly at 3;000 ft. The A&P was to call the tower; explain the situation and be on the lookout for me and then follow. While I was flying; the private pilot was trying to contact tower via text and voice messages. About 15 miles out; I activated every light that I had. All along; both the private pilot and myself were monitoring our individual Foreflights on tablets and phones to look out for traffic. As we were approaching ZZZ1; I check the favored runway. I saw both [Runway] XX and YY were indicating 2kt; but XX was favored. It was my plan to enter a 45 for a right downwind to obtain a light gun. As I was monitoring Foreflight; I noticed traffic taking off on YY. At that time; I made the decision to turn wide and enter a left downwind for YY for a light gun. Not receiving any; not observing any traffic; I landed. As I am on short final; I notice that I have a landing light; and flashing strobes reflecting off the ground. As I taxied to the hangars; I noticed that my A&P were landing on [Runway] XX. After I shut down; I called the tower on my cell phone. I explained to the controller what I have shared here. While talking with him; a fireman wanted to obtain my info. The tower controller said; 'I just popped up' when he saw me land. He suggested we could have filed a flight of two; or returned the next morning and that he had 10 minutes before closing to file his report.
1919011,Approach to ZZZ last minute changed from Runway XX to the ZZZZZ Visual to Runway XYR. A vector heading was given to join a left downwind with the terrain and the airport in visual contact at all times VMC conditions. On joining the downwind while descending and configuring for landing with the terrain clearly visible off the right of the aircraft a caution alert 'terrain /terrain' was annunciated. This was a momentary alert as the rising ridge on the downwind was well off the horizontal plane of the aircraft and was cleared in seconds. More vigilance should have been given to closure rate while descending in this environment so as not to activate mode 2 GPWS.
1868292,While enroute ZZZ-ZZZ1 our center hydraulic quantity started decreasing. While reviewing the appropriate non-normal checklists in [App]; the application crashed twice. We had to close and restart it each time; which resulted in a loss of all open tabs. Essentially we had to start the checklists over from the beginning.This happens frequently (like once or twice per trip). [App] just freezes sometimes -- it doesn't matter whether you're connected to the internet or not.Flight Operations wants to remove paper QRH's from the airplanes. This absolutely cannot be allowed to happen until we have a replacement system that works 100% of the time.
1909382,I landed Runway XX in ZZZ during VMC conditions and exited the runway on A4. At that point; contacted ground and received clearance to taxi to parking (foxtrot) via alpha; cross XX. My student and I were taxing on alpha and wanted to double check to make sure we were cleared to cross Runway XX. Ground then confirmed we were cleared to cross Runway XX. We continued to taxi. As we approached Runway XX; my student and I proceeded to visually check Runway XX for traffic as a precaution. To the right; we saw an aircraft taking off Runway XX. Had we not held short of Runway XX at that time or checked late; there could have been a collision on the runway. Thankfully we held short. At that point I called tower and stated we were holding short of Runway XX for the plane that just took off. Tower then cleared us to cross XX for the 3rd time and apologized.
1868126,After clearing the Runway 36L at AUS on Taxiway G; Ground Control issued us taxi instructions:  'G; C; West Ramp on C.  The First Officer then went off frequency to call Operations. Just before reaching taxiway C; I looked to my left in the direction of the upcoming turn and saw a Aircraft Y; moving southbound on C at about 30-40 knots. I had to slam on my brakes in order to avoid a collision. I then made a snarky remark to the Ground Controller that a head's up about Aircraft Y jet would have been appreciated. He apologized and said something to us to indicate that he had been distracted by ramp traffic and airplanes waiting to get to gates. This could have been a catastrophic collision had I not been glancing to my left.  Recommend a dedicated ramp controller that deals with ramp traffic thereby allowing the Ground Controller to monitor and control the movement area.Ground Control distracted with ramp congestion and never told us about other aircraft.Suggest a dedicated Ramp Control frequency and Controller.
1892421,On DATE; crew scheduling contacted me requesting that I fly Aircraft X that evening due to crew fatigue. The previous crew had experienced a series of mechanical problems throughout the day; and I was to be the relief captain. Knowing this; I arrived at the gate approximately 15-20 minutes before scheduled show time to determine the status of the aircraft; and how repairs were proceeding. Mechanics were working on repairing the hydraulic systems on Aircraft X after a complete hydraulic failure earlier that day. Aircraft X was also being looked at for a pressurization issue. Maintenance believed the hydraulic issue was a simpler problem that could be resolved more expeditiously to minimize potential delay; and they told me it would take 45-60 minutes to complete. When I was notified that the repairs were completed; I returned to the aircraft with the First Officer; and I told him to coordinate with the ramp crew so that I could taxi Aircraft X from the auxiliary parking space to [gate]. I ensured that the hydraulic system was producing pressure via the hydraulic pressure gauge and the lack of annunciation on the annunciator panel. The nose wheel steering system (NWS) was not operating when I attempted to turn out of the parking space; so I shut down and NAME came over to the plane. After various tests and checks to determine the cause of inoperative NWS; and coordinating with NAME1 and NAME2; we determined that it would be best to defer maintenance on the NWS per the MEL procedure; and continue the flight without it. From this point; everything seemed to be returning to normal. I taxied Aircraft X to [gate]; the First Officer and I prepared it for passengers; and we boarded after being fueled. Engine start; taxi; pre-takeoff checks were all normal. During takeoff; after standard call outs; at approximately 100-102 KIAS; prior to our V1/Rotate speed of 106 KIAS; I noticed the taxi light located on the nose gear strut turn off; and the nose subsequently fell to the ground. I immediately and continuously held full aft yoke pressure to shift as much weight to the main gear struts as possible. The First Officer immediately requested priority handling and assisted me with holding the yoke aft. I then pulled both Stop and Feather controls simultaneously; and focused all of my effort to keep the plane on the runway center line using rudder only. I did not use any brakes. During this time I also clarified the nature of the situation with Tower; and requested priority vehicles to meet the plane. After rolling/sliding for approximately 10;000 feet; the First Officer and I looked out the flight deck windows to ensure that there was not a fire; and I asked the Tower if he could see any flames coming from our aircraft.When he answered in the negative. Leaving all exterior lights on; I instructed the First Officer to open the main cabin door; assist the passengers out of the aircraft; and take them to the grass on the East side of the runway. I made an announcement over the PA that we were deplaning; to follow the direction of the First Officer; and exit the plane via the main cabin door. I informed the Tower of all of these things; then assisted the remaining passengers out of the airplane. After ensuring everyone was unharmed; I returned to the aircraft to inform the tower that I was shutting down all remaining systems. I coordinated with company; emergency crews; and airport operations to manage the situation; and only returned to the aircraft a few minutes later to retrieve my jacket. There was an extremely simple step that could have prevented several of these issues along the way: thoroughly; diligently utilizing the acceptance/pre-flight checklist located in the aircraft to ensure the correct configuration of the flight deck. This was not done; and the pre-flight was accomplished by memory; without checklist verification or utilization. Because of this; the Gear Position Control lever was in the UP position throughout this entire chain of events; and was never corrected. It is almost certain to be the cause of the NWS issue; as well as the emergency on the runway. I can't speak for any other pilot; but I can say with absolute confidence that this critical step will never be missed by me again.
1888435,Staffing numbers for the evening shift were four below the number; eight out of twelve; plus one Controller in Charge for the entire shift. Supervisor for the morning/day shift called me at XA:00L asking if I could come in for two hours of overtime at the beginning of the shift since the night shift had taken sick hits. I was originally scheduled to be in at XF:00L and agreed to come in at XD:00L. The other person scheduled for a XF:00 shift also came in at XD:00 for two hours of overtime. The day shift had also taken sick hits and was below the number. Nine out of twelve. One person changed their shift from XD:00L to XZ:00L and was held over one hour at the end of their shift for coverage. Two certified D-Sides from the morning shift were held over two hours. There was one Controller in Charge for the entire night shift starting at XD:30LThe warning areas along the east coast were all active. Within fifteen minutes of working Sector 50; every sector in the area had a D-Side staffing; except Sector 25 (Low sector). On a normal day. D-Sides are not staffing unless it is for training or currency time. During the position relief briefing; I was told that coordination sector to sector had occurred for AR (Atlantic Routes) traffic; single flow over CARPX intersection (190 miles offshore) due to weather and a rocket launch. If aircraft were not offshore capable; then there were to be routed inland; down J121. This coordination had been started early during the day shift; but no official routing was on the status board. Surrounding areas had been told about it. Northern sectors were not participating with the reroutes and aircraft were departing with normal AR routing. There was thirty miles in trail for PBI; MIA; and FLL for aircraft filed down J121 (inland). I had been working roughly ten minutes when the daytime Supervisor came into the area and announced the ZJX inland sectors (J47/J48) had shut off southbound traffic and to expect the same call to my area's south sectors (09/35). About five minutes later; ZJZ sectors J48 and J47 shut off southbound traffic and told to hold. Sector 09 exhausted holding fixes and altitudes available to them with warning area still after. They coordinated the last plane they could take with me at Sector 50. My sector quickly exhausted available holding fixes and altitudes; again with warning areas active to the east. I coordinated with the sector to the northeast side; how many planes I could take from them and hold any other Florida traffic. Sector 34 (sector below mine) shut off daily departures from another sector to the north and told to hold any Florida traffic. Sector 09 shut off northbound traffic from ZJX after roughly twenty to thirty minutes due to holding stacks using every altitude. Any aircraft within sector 09 northbound were vectored to avoid the holding stacks.; which would be coming into my sector and had to be vectored around my holding stacks as well. Any aircraft not going to Florida; either southbound or westbound; also had to be vectored around holding stacks in my sector. After about forty to forty-five minutes later; ZJX started taking southbound traffic; thirty miles in trail per airport. By this time; some aircraft I had been holding requested to divert to nearby airports (RDU or CHS). These required lengthy vectoring to get them lower. Warning areas (W122 and W386) went cold/inactive to accommodate holding for the sectors they were in. W122 is in Sector 09; and W386 is in the sector north of the one I was working; Sector 39. This happened about the time I was being relieved from the sector. AR traffic could still be routed single flow over the CARPX fix if they were able. I was relieved from the sector at about XE:05L. I took a thirty minute break and when I returned; I relieved the controller at Sector 09. There was no longer holding; there was still thirty miles in trail for inland (J121) traffic; very low volume and D-Sides had been released from positions.Earlier in the day; ZJX had shut off ZTL southbound traffic; which in turn; ZTL had shut off the western areas of ZDC. The event that occurred on the east coast could have been avoided. Communication between the Command Center; TMU; and the Centers needs to improve. Although sector to sector coordination is a valuable tool for Controllers; it should not have to be used throughout an entirety of a day; when there is an ongoing issue with the NAS. This event was a complete breakdown in communication when feasible plans could have been put in place to help the centers being inundated with traffic who have weather or low staffing. (Ground stops; SWAP routing; etc.)
1877028,Plane had an air return the day before for nose gear noise on takeoff. We briefed and anticipated an issue. Normal takeoff just prior to 4000 ft. initial level off a thumping sound started followed later by a LGICU (Landing Gear Control Interface Unit) 2 FAIL ECAM. We leveled at 10;000 ft. and coordinated with Maintenance and Dispatch who all agreed we needed to return to ZZZ. We had burned below Max landing weight while coordinating so we returned for a normal landing. Tower did decide to [assign priority handling] for us. Upon landing we had an over wing exit show open. That turned out to be just the cover came off (another repeat from the day prior). PA to remain seated and coordinated with Flight Attendants that the exit was closed. Taxied to the Gate and swapped planes to go to ZZZ1.
1893168,Shortly after takeoff out of ZZZ airport we got an auto press caution message at around 3;500 ft. We elected to level off at 5000 ft. and get vectors away from the storms. I was Pilot Flying. I took controls and radios and asked my First Officer to pull out the Quick Reference Checklist and Quick Reference Handbook for Auto Press Caution message. We completed the checklists. Advised Dispatch; ATC; and Flight Attendants. I received reports of ear discomfort from the Flight Attendants.I noted we had passengers onboard who were susceptible to medical issues from potential extraneous ear pressure; i.e. babies and older passengers. We elected to return to the airfield in the interest of safety. Other contributing factors I had in mind were storms; high cruising altitude; high task saturation; and the increase of risk factor of potential further issues/emergencies/failures that could arise in flight on top of the already highly task saturated duty of manual pressurization and deviations of storms.Auto pressurization failure; inner ear pressure issues potentially causing damage. Task saturation. If anything else were to occur during flight on top of having to dedicate duties away from flying to control the pressurization manually then it would increase risk factor and degrade pilot attentiveness and safety of flight further.
1903585,Uneventful Qual Line Check flight to ZZZ from ZZZ1. After the passengers had deplaned; our Flight Attendant (FA) cabin jump seater entered the flight deck and informed the pilots that doors 1L and 1R had incorrect placards installed. Specifically; the placards with the word 'OPEN' and the illustration on how to open the main cabin door in a priority situation. The placards for the 'Left' doors are mirror images of the placards for the 'Right' doors. The difference being the orientation of the diagram. She explained that she had found this discrepancy on 'at least 10' aircraft; that it was a 'no-go item' and that we should write it up once we were inbound to ZZZ1; since cabin inspectors would be looking for this issue. I thanked her for bringing this to our attention; and explained the requirement to write up any known discrepancies or irregularities as soon as they were known. We contacted Maintenance and described the issue; and they dispatched a contract mechanic; who did a fantastic job deferring the issue. They printed facsimile placards and fastened them in place; resulting in minimal delays. I bring this to the attention for several reasons. This aircraft as obviously operated numerous flight segments with improper placards installed.  I recommend reaching out to Maintenance to see if a fleet directive or other inspection program should be initiated to check for similar errors. Should consider reaching out to the safety team in case there are mechanics who should file reports for the incorrect placard installation. Should consider reaching out so that the jump seating Flight Attendant can submit a report with her perspective on the event. What is most troubling for me is that she likely noticed this issue during boarding in ZZZ1; as she was one of the first people on the aircraft and had notified numerous crews of this issue yet she chose to wait until her commuter flight arrived in ZZZ to notify the crew of the discrepancy. This act indicates that our Inflight Services partners might need to re-emphasize the importance of notifying the flight deck as soon as they find a defect or discrepancy with the aircraft.
1867680,"I was flying in the pattern doing takeoff and landing practice. It was extremely crowded with many airplanes in the pattern. I was on the downwind getting close to turning base to Runway 31. That circuit is a right pattern. I was probably alerted by TCAS; but I looked at my display and saw an aircraft close to me and below on my left side. I looked out the window and there was another airplane passing below me from my left to my right. I then saw it about 200 or 300 ft. below me on my right side. At that moment the Tower Controller asked if I saw the airplane on my right. I responded with yes"" and then I said that ""I just flew over him."" I then proceeded to turn base and subsequently land. At that time; I was surprised that the controller didn't warn me about the airplane; but I continued my day without thinking much about it.This evening I was reflecting on what happened and realized that the incident could have been my fault. I don't recall the Tower saying to follow another airplane before landing. If so; then I should have kept that airplane in sight. As I am thinking now; if that was the case; maybe the other airplane was in the downwind leg as normal or possibly rather wide. Then; maybe I continued in the downwind pattern moving closer to the runway than the other airplane; which would put me to the right of it. It then turned to base and passed below me. By the time I saw it; it was too close for me to take any evasive action; even if I thought it was necessary.It may have been lucky that I was about 250 ft. above the published pattern altitude and the other airplane was either at pattern altitude or lower; giving us a wide margin. Had that not been the case it could have been a near miss or worse."""
