1920608,"We identified an unsafe and potentially catastrophic condition in the Gulfstream GVII-G500 and Gulfstream GVII-G600 Airplane Flight Manual. We contacted the Original Equipment Manufacturer Gulfstream to inform them of the unsafe condition, and did not receive qualitative justification, leading to believe the unsafe condition is still present. Gulfstream promotes that the ""Appendix A1: Reduced Thrust (FLEX) Takeoff"", located in the GVII-500 and GVII-G600 Airplane Flight Manual, can be used as an alternative to the Chapter 5 - Performance, to determine allowable takeoff weight from short aircraft. To that effect, Gulfstream has also convinced airport performance providers such as Airport Performance Group (APG) to use this supplement as an alternative to Chapter 5. Customers use those blindly. This could have devastating consequences as a quick examination of the Accelerate-Go and Accelerate-Stop distances in the Chapter 5 will clearly indicate that this method does not appropriately respect necessary basic conditions to allow a safe takeoff. Example: 5,000 ft. runway at 50 ft. elevation, WET runway and 15 degrees Celsius. The Appendix A1 tells the operator the following: At the next higher pressure altitude in the chart (1000 ft because interpolation is not accepted). Takeoff flaps 20. Takeoff weight: 60,000 lb. FLD LENGTH (FT) 4970 (although not clear or explained what this parameter incorporates). V1 KIAS 116. VR KIAS 118. V2 KIAS 133. However, when reporting those parameters in the Chapter 5, at this specific V1 over VR ratio (0.983), an effective runway length of 5,000 ft., we get that the GVII-G500 aircraft would need 4,200 ft. of runway for the Accelerate-go, but would require 6,400 ft. for the Accelerate-stop distance, putting public at great risk if the pilot had to make the decision to stop the aircraft right before V1. This situation is of great concern. The FLD LENGTH parameter in the Appendix A1 does not consider the higher value of the Accelerate-go or accelerate-stop and is therefore NOT conservative. Furthermore, the said supplement does not offer an example on how a pilot would use such a supplement in lieu of using Chapter 5 to calculate performance. All of which poses a great danger to public safety and is an accident waiting to happen."
1916481,"Aircraft X was instructed to cross Runway 19 at L but instead crossed Runway 24 at L, the departure runway with an aircraft, Aircraft Y, already cleared for takeoff and in departure roll. Aircraft Y overflew Aircraft X at approximately 10ft. The taxiway that connects Runway 19 to the Alpha pad should be renamed Taxiway Alpha to avoid confusion. Taxiway alpha should extend from the alpha pad."
1870834,"We were flying ZZZ-ZZZ1. In our descent into ZZZ1 (ZZZZZ Arrival) we were approximately at 17000 feet when I (Captain) opened the speed brakes. As soon as I opened the speed brakes we received a FLAP FAIL message. We immediately performed the QRH procedures and decided the game plan would be to divert to ZZZ2. We notified dispatch, ATC, spoke to the Flight Attendant's and passengers of the situation and game plan. ATC asked us if we wanted to request priority handling, but we told them to deploy Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) just as a precaution so they could check brake temps upon landing. ATC decided to give priority handling for us. Once set up for the approach (ILS XXC-VFR conditions at the airfield) and briefed, we set up for a long straight in final and configured early. We landed without incident and momentarily stopped the aircraft on the Runway. CFR requested we pull off the next Taxiway so we elected to do that. CFR checked all brake temperatures and gave us the ok. We proceeded to our new Gate XX67 and CFR met us at the Gate for one final brake check."
1891681,"I flew behind my house and above the woods with line of sight. Upon flight I was trying different settings on the new drone. I lost control and was disoriented with the direction of flight. I lost connection to the drone multiple times and the return to home function was not set properly and it tried to return to a location that was south of me. A helicopter was in the area. They indicated that I flew within 20 feet of their aircraft but I did not see them. I tried to navigate back to my location and after multiple attempts I was successful. The helicopter followed the drone back to my location and Public Officials confiscated the drone. I do not have access to the video, only the flight logs. The App shows when aircraft are present or close. This never occurred until returning home and the helicopter was circling the house. Not sure if the helicopter was broadcasting or any other traffic was present."
1885604,"We took off on Runway XXR on the ZZZZZ departure. Climbing through 29000 ft., we received AFT COMPT LOOP FAULT. I leveled off at 30000 ft. and we ran the QRH checklist. We then received the CARGO COMPT SMOKE ECAM message and a Master Caution. I took over ATC comm 1 radio and [advised ATC] and requested return to ZZZ. The FO (First Officer) continued the checklist, changed the destination and set us up for a return to Runway XYR at ZZZ. We had an uneventful landing and the fire department used thermal cameras to check for heat signature in the AFT compartment. No indications were seen and we taxied back to the ramp. This is an edited version of my first [report] from this event. I was PF (Pilot Flying). We took off on [Runway] XXR on the ZZZZZ departure. Climbing through 29000 ft.,we had a AFT COMPT LOOP FAULT ECAM message with a Cargo Loop Fault procedure. My FO (First Officer) opened the QRH to the Cargo Loop Fault checklist. After further reflection on our actions during the event and referencing the Systems manual and QRH again, I realized the Cargo Loop Fault checklist does not fully explain how to do a Loop Test. The checklist states, ""Loop Test - Perform"" but does not go into detail on HOW to perform a loop test. The systems manual does, and on step X. Loop Test Pushbutton it states - ""Pressed and held IN"". My FO did not press and hold in the Loop Test button, he only pressed and released it. The next sentence in the QRH Cargo Loop Fault checklist states, ""If SMOKE light does not illuminate for affected compartment (smoke condition exists):"" My FO and I looked at each other and said, ""We must have smoke."" We then continued the checklist by RE-SELECTING LOOP A (which had faulted) and turned OFF the OTHER LOOP. Almost immediately we received the CARGO COMPT SMOKE ECAM Master Warning and chime as the checklist states, Procedure: CARGO COMPT SMOKE. I took over ATC communications 1 radio and [requested priority handling], requested return to ZZZ as the FO continued the checklist, changed the destination and set us up for a return to XYR back at ZZZ. Uneventful landing and the fire department used thermal cameras to check for heat signature in the AFT compartment. No indications were seen and we taxied back to the ramp. If you look at the [Aircraft] System manual, you can see the photo of the Lower Cargo Smoke Detection system and see that by re-selecting a faulted LOOP A, and turning OFF the good LOOP B, you will receive a SMOKE detection, which is what we had. In addition, if you turn the page in the QRH you will see ""Additional Information"" which uses the example of an Illuminated LOOP A fault. This information is very important and a reference to it should be included on page XXX of the QRH. I would recommend a change to the QRH CARGO LOOP FAULT checklist to edit the ""LOOP TEST - PERFORM"" to closely match the Systems manual and should read, ""LOOP TEST - PRESS AND HOLD IN"". ALL lights on the Cargo Compartment Smoke Detection panel should illuminate which will confirm a faulty loop (see second boldfaced sentence). If the SMOKE light does NOT illuminate for affected compartment, smoke condition exists. If you flip the two boldface sentences, the checklist will make more sense after you ""perform a loop test"" by holding the button IN. Since our FO's do not perform a Main Deck or Cargo compartment LOOP test during their preflight, they may not understand you must hold the button in to do the loop test."
1870987,"During the initial climb of flight number service from ZZZ to ZZZ1, we got a BLEED 2 FAIL EICAS msg at FL320 and climbing to FL350, we immediately stopped the climb and I ran the QRH. The message did not go away, but we decided then to continue to ZZZ1 at FL310 in accordance with the QRH. BLEED 2 OVERPRESS appeared 42 min into the flight (maybe 10min after the first EICAS), also persistent, we followed the QRH as well, XBLEED was pushed out for the reminder of the flight and EICAS overpress was gone. The new QRH put a band aid on the plane that lasted about 5 to 10 min. The message came back after that, the QRH thus called to request priority handling and land in nearest suitable airport. The Captain, ATC and myself all agreed on ZZZ2. We executed a descent and ran the QRC for that and landed with no other issues afterwards. The Captain got himself numbers and worked the box, while I was briefing the approach, obtaining the ATIS and talking to ATC. He also took care of the PAs. We did not exceed any limitations, nor did we request priority into the alternate. The rest of the flight was uneventful."
1868552,"I was assigned to fly the freighter ZZZ-ZZZ1. Upon arrival in operations I was notified that the plane wouldn't likely be to the cargo parking area until around XA00, even though we had a XB55 departure time scheduled. When I met the Captain I relayed what I had heard about the arrival time and he offered the idea to taxi the plane from the maintenance hangar to cargo parking. When we arrived at the hanger we were notified it was there because it had previously been involved with a fire in the ground power receptacle area. Reviewing the logbook also indicated the aircraft had been involved with a fire and had multiple repairs done because of the fire, including damage to a pressure vessel seal. I performed a personal assessment of the threats for a roughly 3 hour 45 minute flight to ZZZ1 that we were facing. -Airplane just out of maintenance with no functional check flight. -night flight. -poor weather currently and in the forecast for ZZZ. -poor weather along the route to ZZZ1. -unknown runway conditions along route. -possibly no ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) along the route. -still need reposition from hangar to cargo. -still needed to be loaded with cargo. -needed lots of de-ice. -both pilots only getting more fatigued. -best case scenario, we would depart around XA30 after showing at XC55. I expressed my concerns to the Captain and said I'm of the opinion that the airplane should have a functional check flight prior to it operating again. Also, the fear of if we have a problem, we have almost zero divert options. Captain then called flight operations to consult the concerns and they indicated that the fire was suspected to be caused from the ground power cart cable and indicated that after consulting with Maintenance, it seems safe to proceed with the flight. Reviewing the verbiage of the FOM, it states that a functional check flight is required after major work is performed and Flight Operations or Maintenance can request the flight. We jointly decided that the repairs done should warrant a functional check flight. It was then that the Captain communicated flight operations that we are opting to decline the airplane."
1864976,This report is filed to report a maintenance omission. Aircraft X arrived with an APU keel duct pressure seal missing. The aircraft was taken out of service because of the lengthy time required to correct this issue. This can lead to pressurization leaks/issues. There have been several other aircraft with the same issue.
1864918,"We were on approach to RWY 30 into BZN on the RNAV RNP 30 from Livingston transition. We were getting moderate turbulence with the wind around 600-70 kts below 10,000 [feet]. We had thoroughly briefed the approach prior to the descent. While on the approach around 5,000ft Tower advised us the an aircraft had circled to 30 from ILS 12 and during the approach experienced a 2,000 fpm updraft and moderate turbulence on approach but braking action was good upon landing. Around LAVPE, the Captain called for below the line landing checklist while we were descending on the VPATH. I ran the checklist and then looked at my Jepp Approach Chart to confirm what the missed approach altitude was, it was right after that we got a ""Caution Terrain"" aural warning followed by Tower telling us we had a low altitude warning. We then got another caution terrain warning and the Captain disconnected the AP and started to climb, I saw at that point we were below the VPATH somehow. We started to climb back towards the path and then got the RWY in sight and descended for a normal landing. Some time between me going heads down to run the below the line landing checklist and MOSNE intersection we got low and I still do not know how. We were on AP and VPATH just a few seconds prior, I don't know if we got a downdraft or what but I'm still confused as to how the aircraft got low. We decided to continue to the approach instead of going around and I believe that was the safer of the two options giving the wind gusts and moderate turbulence in mountainous and unfamiliar (for me first time to BZN) terrain. We both had a long day (I commuted in that morning because I missed my last commute the night prior due to operational delays) and had been fighting turbulence all day long on ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ-BZN routes which probably made us more tired than normal. This was my first time into BZN and the low visibility, moderate icing from the snow storm, and moderate (or greater) turbulence on approach made it tougher to concentrate and multi task. I'm not sure how we got below the path on approach as I was Pilot Monitoring and heads down running the checklist so I have no suggestions as of now. I should have done a better job monitoring our descent and VPATH even while conducting the Landing Checklist."
1864751,Me and my student were doing ground reference maneuvers near the town of Name and a rotorcraft was inbound for ZZZ. We made several calls about where we were in relation to the airport and even other aircraft could here us making the calls. The helicopter cut through our approach path and I took the controls from my student and made an abrupt decision to introduce power and climb away from the maneuver because he was descending into us. The rotorcraft then went and cut someone off on final for Runway X at ZZZ. What I feel can be done about this is the pilot needs to be talked too about visual scanning if he would've been scanning for traffic while flying and listening to radio calls this report wouldn't be typed to begin with.
1859056,"While operating Aircraft X we received a ""Cell call"" message on ACARS from our Dispatcher. The message informed us that we were NORDO and that we needed to contact center on Frequency X. In the 5 mins prior the radios were quiet. For the night in particular, we didn't find this to be that unusual because radio chatter had already been sporadic. Guard was tuned on VHF 2, however we turned it down due to unnecessary chatter earlier in the flight. As a procedure, guard should be tuned, and selected in VHF 2 with the volume turned up loud enough to be heard. If radio chatter becomes unnecessary and distracting then guard should be turned down for no longer than 5 minutes. This could alleviate any potential NORDO incidents in the future."
1858937,"Around the last week of Month during our move from the west hangar to our new facility in the east side of the airport many pallets with un-serviceable back hold parts were loaded on trailer trucks without the proper dangerous goods documentation or undeclared, with the final destination of ZZZ1. They were loaded following instructions to do so by our leadership team. We were unaware of the present of Dangerous Goods in many or several of these pallets and were not instructed of the need to provide any Dangerous Goods documentation only to load the pallets onto the trailer trucks. We neither had the system to retrieve any information that would have alert us about the presence of these dangerous goods parts."
1857915,Solo flight in PA18 with wheel skis configured in a wheels down position. Locked brake during landing resulting in propeller contacting the ground. Landing surface snow covered gravel with areas of exposed gravel. Push rod connecting front seat brake pedal to master cylinder was discovered pinned under wheel/ski pump after stopping on the runway. Aircraft was stopped on the runway following the propeller contacting the ground. Front brake pedals were not used during the landing. No additional damage to the aircraft or property. Tower was notified of the aircraft being shutdown on the landing surface and a tow was requested. Aircraft was towed from the landing surface. Locked brake perception was insidious due to slippery surface initially and the drag increased rapidly just prior to prop contact. Mid roll out there were sounds similar to the back of the skis dragging if the pressure drops a little in the wheel ski pump or the skis are not installed properly but I did not process as possible brake lock during the landing. Sound was most likely gravel kicking up and hitting the ski from the locked brake. There was also a light quartering headwind with an approximate 5kt crosswind on the same side as the locked brake to add to the poor perception. The mechanical situation is preventable with adjustment of the ski pump installation to avoid interference with the brake push rod. I also intend to add a visual check of brake rods/cables to my before landing checklist and be more vigilant for unusual sensory perceptions that do not match my expected environment.
1849581,"In short, the Tower Controller created a situation in which I felt I was out of options, and ultimately led to a wake turbulence / jet blast encounter for my student and me. I was providing flight instruction in a Cessna 172 while my student was flying the RNAV 36 at MYR (the student was wearing a view limiting device and I was responsible for looking outside, see & avoid, etc). As we were approximately 3-4 nautical miles out from Runway 36, a Navy Aircraft Y was in the tower pattern for touch-and-goes, and the Tower Controller cleared the Aircraft Y for a short approach in front of us. This was a day with winds aloft from approximately 270, so the Aircraft Y had a tail wind on the base leg. The Aircraft Y's short approach was still a rather wide base, and it appeared to be in a steady descending turn straight toward us at approximately the same altitude as us. I asked Tower if the Aircraft Y was turning towards us; Tower acknowledged they were making a short approach ahead of us; I responded that the angle looked a little close; Tower issued the Aircraft Y a traffic advisory to look for us on a 3-mile final, to which the Aircraft Y responded they had us in sight. My student continued his approach under the hood. Once the Aircraft Y turned final (I would estimate approximately 1.5 miles ahead of us, at approximately 300 ft AGL), Tower instructed the Aircraft Y to go around. I am unsure of why the go-around was given to the Aircraft Y. I was worried about wake turbulence and began to cycle through options in my head: -I determined I couldn't go around upwind, because I would have to outclimb the short approach of an Aircraft Y to avoid wake turbulence -I determined I couldn't go around straight ahead, because the Aircraft Y had applied takeoff thrust and I cannot out-climb a Aircraft Y in a C172 -I determined I couldn't go around downwind, because the wake turbulence would be blown downwind; additionally, there's a busy tour helicopter helipad just east of the runway 36 threshold so I didn't want to conflict with any helicopter traffic. In the short amount of time this took to unfold, I determined none of the above alternatives were acceptable, which left me having my student continue the approach and just hoping the wake turbulence and jet blast had blown downwind. It is the first time I've ever felt helpless in an airplane, and it really rattled me when I got on the ground and reflected on it. We continued the approach and at approximately 300ft AGL we experienced sharp, jolting turbulence for approximately one second. I believe we were lucky and did not hit the epicenter of the wake turbulence / jet blast, as I know it can flip a light GA aircraft or cause catastrophic damage. After the encounter, my student continued the approach and made a normal landing. In my state of disbelief, I failed to inform Tower of the wake turbulence encounter. After reflecting on the incident, I think both Tower and I could have made better decisions to avoid the encounter, and maybe even the Aircraft Y as well: -I may have had a case of ""get-there-itis,"" as the only scenarios that ran through my head involved continuing forward in some capacity. I believe my best course of action would have been to take controls from my student and execute a go around with a 90-degree left turn, or a left 180 degree turn. It never crossed my mind to turn around, and I will always consider that as an option going forward. -If Tower had been more cognizant of wake turbulence, they likely would not have given a Aircraft Y a short approach in front of a Cessna on final approach -Additionally, if Tower had instructed us to go around, rather than the Aircraft Y, I believe this would have been a non-event. -It is hard for me to tell, but the Aircraft Y performed a pretty wide short approach so maybe they should have kept it a little tighter or declined the short approach. -I don't believe Tower ever gave us a wake turbulence warning after giving the Aircraft Y a short approach. I have been instructing out of MYR in Cessnas for XX years so I am very cognizant of wake turbulence even without ""Caution Wake Turbulence"" warnings from controllers, but I would be worried if a student pilot solo was in that same situation got overwhelmed or couldn't properly visualize the wake turbulence."
1849672,"After deplaning all customers, our flight attendants stated that they smelled musty fumes from the mid to aft cabin area (rows 14-21) during low altitude descent during approach and that the fumes remained until the engines were shut down at the gate. I did not smell any fumes. After obtaining pertinent information from the flight attendants, ZZZ maintenance was notified, and a discrepancy was entered into the aircraft logbook. As was previously stated, the fumes event was brought to our attention only after deplaning was completed and we did not smell fumes in the flight deck."
1848362,"We operated under Medevac, but left the kidney in ZZZ. It all started with a call to Maintenance. While powering on the aircraft, the message ""EICAS OVHT"" flashed a couple times followed by ""EICAS FAULT."" At this point, I noticed a little bit of moisture surrounding the Display Unit. I called Maintenance who suggested that I run the EICAS FAULT check. It worked, the fault cleared, and by the end of my call with Maintenance, the moisture around the Display Unit's dissipated. (I only added that because the moisture was in the back of my mind the entire flight and may have contributed to me forgetting the kidney.) Right after I ended the call, my First Officer got back from his walk around and told me that the nose wheel was missing a bonding strap. I believe it was at this point I'd take a look at the release and was aware of our Medevac status. I called Maintenance back and they told me they'd be sending Maintenance out. While waiting, we set up and briefed for the flight like normal. While briefing the departure, the mechanic arrived and took the logbook with less than 10 minutes to departure time. [Mechanic] handed it back with one minute to go. I took a quick look at it, said it was good and we closed [aircraft door]. After the before start check list, I decided to recheck the corrective action and saw that the mechanic had written main landing gear instead of nose landing gear. I called Maintenance and asked him to express urgency because we were a Medevac flight. While waiting the second time and waiting for the takeoff numbers because the plane was still showing out of service, I asked the rampers if they were sure they had loaded the kidney. He told me he'd double check and came back a moment later saying it was. At XA:55, ten minutes after departure time, the mechanic gave us the logbook back with the edit. We quickly got our takeoff numbers, pushed back and taxied out. While taxiing out, Ground asked us to confirm we were a Medevac flight. At this point, I thought we were, so for the entire flight, we kept the status of Medevac. Just before we started our descent into ZZZ1, it dawned on me that we never received a notification about Dry Ice, thinking that a human organ would need to be kept cool. I checked the takeoff remarks and didn't see anything. I messaged Dispatch who said he'd check with Ops. After we landed, I saw the message that we might not have received the kidney. After parking, I went outside to watch the ground crew unload the bags until they gave me confirmation the kidney was not on board. I did however notice a box wrapped in a red plastic bag. I believe the ZZZ rampers mistook that for the kidney we were supposed to have on board. Even though it would have all but guaranteed a delay, had I gone and looked that the kidney was onboard with my own eyes, all of this would have been avoided. The fact that I was trying to avoid any delays so I could do my part in saving a life ended up causing the biggest delay of all."
1838807,"I was made aware by the A [Flight Attendant] that we only had three of our four required emergency checklists for both ditching and land emergency evacuations. As a crew we determined this to be a ""no-go"" issue, so the A requested one each of the checklists that were missing. We were initially informed that the station didn't have any. Immediately upon being informed of the situation, the Captain became very agitated and began questioning the A as to why we needed the checklists. After an explanation was attempted, the Captain, again in a very agitated manner, proceeded to get on his cell and call the Chief Pilot. As a crew, we checked the manual to confirm that we were correct in our understanding that we had to have four on board and confirmed this to be accurate, to the best of our interpretation. Someone also called for an Inflight Supervisor to come to the gate, but I am not exactly certain which of the crew made that call. A Supervisor did arrive and informed us that they were looking for one, but she had been informed that we were ok using our [tablets] in the event they couldn't find one. At no point up to this time did I feel like anyone considered this more than an annoyance and an unnecessary interruption to their abilities to board the plane for an on time departure. I was even threatened with termination of my job after I said I would not fly if we didn't have the proper equipment. We as Flight Crew are already on high alert where safety and security was concerned, we all felt like no one else cared about anything else but the flight being delayed. I have never felt less supported or more pressured by a Captain in my time of flying. When all was said and done, they found additional copies in the training room, which was what we had recommended about 20 minutes prior."
1838688,"While [enroute] to MMMM (Morelia, Mexico), we briefed and prepared for the VOR DME 2 approach to Runway 5. We were advised by Mexico Center to contact Morelia Approach and to descend and maintain 11,000 feet. Morelia Approach asked us to report 25 nm DME from the airport. At 10 nm DME, Morelia Approach cleared us for the VOR DME 1 to Runway 5. Because of high terrain on all quadrants, night time, unfamiliarity with the terrain/environment, low to the ground condition, we decided to ask the Controller to keep us on the VOR DME 2 instead. The Controller claimed to not have such an approach available for that airport. We told him we had all the information we needed to safely execute the approach in our FMS database. We sighted the runway and asked for a visual approach. We were granted clearance for the visual approach and flew the profile corresponding to the VOR DME 2 approach which we were all set up for. The landing went on uneventfully. In the future, I'll make sure to ask the Controller as soon as able for the approach in use (there was no ATIS at this airport) so that we can set up for the right approach and thus avoid last minute changes which could be fatal specially at unfamiliar/high terrain airports."
1837663,"At (XA05 L) we were cleared for takeoff from runway XX. It was a rainy night after a typhoon had passed through, and although the wind was calm, we needed our wipers on for the rain. We were accelerating normally, I called 80 knots and the captain acknowledged. A few seconds later when my eyes were scanning the engine instruments I heard several thumps against the fuselage and heard the captain say ""Birds."" He later told me he said this when he saw many medium-sized white streaks pass through our lights. I saw the captain pull the thrust levers to idle and say ""Reject."" I believe we were about 110 knots (V1 of 143 knots was well above our speed on the speed scale) but I did not notice the exact speed. After a normal RTO procedure, the captain called and I completed the QRH procedure for Rejected Takeoff. Tower instructed us to make a 180 degree turn on the runway, and after the turn we noticed that the BTMS was climbing more than expected. I calculated for a 120 knots reject at our takeoff weight (345,000 lbs) we should see a BTMS Indication of 5. When the BTMS indication on several brakes increased above 5, I called Tower and requested the fire services to come check for fire and smoke from the brakes. After the fire services arrived and told us (via Tower because fire services did not have an aviation frequencies radio) there was no smoke or fire, we saw one wheel (#2) indicate BTMS 9, and two wheels (#3 and #4) indicate BTMS 8, so asked fire services if any tires were flat. They told us that one wheel on the left side was flat, and at that point the captain decided to start the APU and shut off the engines as it was clear that we would not be taxiing back. I tried calling Company ramp/maintenance on the frequency on the chart but we got no answer, so we asked Tower to relay information to our maintenance and request assistance. Fire services then relayed to us that a tire on the right side was also flat. Maintenance arrived around time XA50 and plugged in to the intercom to let us know they would inspect and decide on a course of action. At XB25 with BTMS in the range of 1-2, they started slowly towing us back to the ramp. We exited the runway at around XC05 and set the parking brake on the ramp at 1825 Z. Multiple Bird strikes on takeoff roll causing a rejected takeoff Airport authority should be better at controlling the birds at ZZZ airport"
1837462,"During boarding First Officer and I smelled an acrid odor. It started to get stronger and the flight attendants called and let us know they smelled it as well. Since the odor was getting stronger and we didn't have any immediate indication as to what was causing it, I chose to expeditiously deplane the aircraft through the main cabin door. While exiting the aircraft, one of the customers remarked that he thought the smell ""was electrical in nature."" After deplaning we called Maintenance out to look at the jet. After some back and forth about possible causes, Maintenance decided to take the jet out of service to do a deeper dive. We swapped aircraft and completed the flight with a different tail number."
1922435,Aircraft X was conducting a training flight in the south central working area. Student was performing a simulated engine failure scenario. Student had selected a field and was approximately abeam the field descending in a power idle glide at 68 knots. Aircraft X was beginning a left hand descending turn to intercept final for the simulated emergency field at approximately 700 feet AGL when an aircraft (Aircraft Y) flew under ours. Instructor immediately took the control and executed a climbing turn away from other aircraft. Instructor was using an iPad with ForeFlight; aircraft was equipped with a stratus. Instructor did not see the other aircraft before beginning the descending left hand turn.
1883723,I was the pilot flying. Low visibility takeoff from [Runway] XXR in ZZZ. After a 30 second engine run up engines were normal. After v1 at rotation speed we experienced a violent bang followed by a right engine failure with associated yaw and severe vibration. I thought we had hit something during takeoff it was so violent. The FO (First Officer) commented 'what was that followed by engine failure? Flames were reported coming out the tailpipe by Tower. The problem was difficult to identify because the only initial indication was low fuel flow on the right engine; other engine parameters indicated normal. We flew the special engine out procedure. Cleaned up the plane and did the engine fire severe damage checklist. We had an amended release for a takeoff alternate ZZZ1. We requested priority handling and diverted to ZZZ1 climbing to 15;000 ft. The weather at ZZZ1 was VMC and the runways were long cleared. We elected to dump the center tank fuel to lighten the plane for landing. At ZZZ1 we were still overweight for landing so we entered holding and contacted flight control about an overweight landing. We then decided to land on [Runway] XXL AT 335;000 lbs. We landed uneventfully and rolled to the end of the runway where we had fire and rescue inspect the plane and were cleared to parking. This was an extremely challenging worst case scenario with poor weather in mountainous weather and an engine failure right after v1 with a takeoff alternate. The [Relief Pilot] and FO did an outstanding job of helping to identify the failure; run checklists and coordinate with ATC and the company.
1892449,After arriving at the gate in ZZZZ; the inflight crew notified me that they smelled a strong dirty sock smell during deplaning. The APU was running; but they smelled the odor prior to the APU bleed being turned on. The odor persisted during the deboarding. I called [Maintenance Control] and local Maintenance came out. I agreed to help troubleshoot by completing 2 engine runs with guidance from the local technicians. Through isolation troubleshoot procedures we determined that the odor existed when either Eng 1 or APU bleed were supplying either or both packs. Maintenance Control and local Maintenance decided to defer both the Eng 1 and APU bleed. After landing in ZZZ on the return flight; the inflight crew notified me that they again experienced the odor during descent at approximately 18k ft.
1923706,Crash Report - Hull Loss - DJI Mini 2 - Impact with tree. No damage to property. Recreational flying - Licensed UAS Pilot - Class D Airspace 0 to 50 ft. with LAANC Authorization. Winds 10 knots with gusts to 20 knots. Mission- Acquire sunset pictures. Decision Error- Attempted to fly between two trees with 15-foot gap at a distance of 200 yards. (Adverse mental state - mission placed above safety; flying an unplanned maneuver.) Temporarily lost sight of drone and immediately went into hover. Operator attempted to reposition to regain sight of drone. Operator was unsuccessful. Operator decided to yaw UAS left 360 degrees to regain situational awareness. Approximately 90 degrees into pivot; discovered that drone was really close to a tree. (Adverse psychological state induced - surprise factor with adrenaline spike). Decision Error- Operator decided to back drone away from tree; prior to completing 360 degree situational awareness pivot. Skill based error (improper control input) Operator applies significant aft control input (still experiencing Adverse psychological state of adrenaline spike). Video image goes wacky followed by loss of signal from drone. Impact with other tree. Adverse physical state: blood drains from head; sick to stomach. Adverse psychological state- Operator remembers that he purchased DJI Care package with purchase of UAS. Operator chooses joy. Operator retrieves UAS and returns to Ready Room to tell other pilots not to do this. DON'T DO THIS!!
1894363,On our descent to Grand Junction we encountered severe turbulence while being vectored to CESBA the IAF on the RNAV 29. We were at the turbulence penetration speed when it occurred due to moderate turbulence most of the flight. It occurred at about 12;500 feet; the aircraft banked approximately 30 degrees; we lost plus or minus 300 feet of altitude and had a 20 kt loss in the sudden descent. We checked in on our FA (Flight Attendant) and passengers and no injuries were sustained. We were also given a 230 heading but during the intense workload but the PF accidentally turned to 320 but was corrected promptly without any issues with ATC. We had to switch to runway 11 after a major wind shift and landed safely to end the flight.
1894632,Cleared to Land on Runway XXL at ZZZ. At minimums call-out was stable and continued. As entered ground effect; the flare was slightly flat causing a bounce. As a result of this the aircraft was left of center line. Right rudder was applied however the aircraft veered to the left and directional control was lost. The aircraft came off the runway and crossed the taxiway coming to a complete stop on the parking area. The propeller had struck the ground at slow speed once entering the taxiway. What I have learnt from this is making sure landings are not flat and the flare is initiated at the appropriate time. Whilst doing so maintain directional control and make sure toes are off the brakes on landing. And to correct in the situation would have been to go around when a bounce occurs and to apply enough rudder to maintain directional control.
1921597,I completed a visual approach and landing on Runway 15 at SAF. After landing on 15 I rolled past Taxiway F and as I approached Runway 02/20 the Tower Controller issued taxi instructions to turn left on 20 and taxi to parking via Taxiways G and A. I did not hear the latter part of the transmission clearly and asked for a repeat. He repeated the instruction as I was turning left onto 02/20. During the turn I struck something; at this time I do not know what I hit but it was large enough to reach the prop and cause significant damage. I immediately informed the Tower Controller that I had hit an unknown object. He had not observed the event. During the approach to landing an airport maintenance truck requested permission to inspect the runway; he did not state why. I assume so but do not know if the sweep was completed or if the object I hit was found. My turn was across the transition paved surface between [Runway] 15 and 02/20. I do not recall any marking on this surface and I do not believe the edges of [Runway] 15 are marked.  When I got the instruction to turn I believe I was too close to the surface over which I taxied to physically be able to see what was on the ground immediately in front of the aircraft. If I hit something like a runway light the runway environment at this location is very poorly marked. If maintenance knew there was a foreign object in the area they should have so stated and cleared the area before any further operations took place.
1906763,Towards the end of boarding B FA (Flight Attendant) asked if I smelled anything unusual aft of the aircraft; I didn't; we waited some more. B FA had communication with flight deck and said that there was a smell aft of the aircraft. I then moved to the left aft of the aircraft to see if I could notice it and did; B FA and I thought it was coming from air vents on top ably everything jump seats. Then pilots made an announcement to let passengers know we might have to deplane; then when we did deplane; maintenance happened.
1897882,Just after acceleration height and after gear and flaps were up; somewhere around 200 kts. we got master caution pitch trim light. Ran the checklist during climb and came to the conclusion we lost pitch trim control meaning the trim was stuck in an aft pitch up condition. Once we leveled off at cruise alt we concluded that 200 kts. was the best airspeed since at that airspeed the aircraft was pretty much trimmed out with very little manual elevator control needed. Called Maintenance and Dispatch and made the decision to continue to ZZZ1. Our biggest concern was how much manual elevator control was going to be needed at landing configuration and which flap setting was going to require the least manual input. Ended up [requesting priority handling] because by asking for XXL it triggered ATC to declare it for us due to priority handling. Landed on XXL with flaps 15 which turned out to be the best configuration since the approach and landing turned out to be a none event. No FAR's or aircraft limitations were exceeded or broken during event.
1931515,Upon approach to ZZZ from the south; ATIS frequency was observed; but no information was broadcast. After contacting ZZZ Approach; was advised that wind was 120 at 10 knots and cleared to enter right downwind for runway XXL.  The aircraft touched down smoothly and inline with the runway centerline. When the nose wheel touched down; the aircraft suddenly veered to the right. Attempts to correct the direction resulted in tire skidding and the aircraft nearly tipped over onto a wing. I allowed the aircraft to continue on course to avoid damage.  The aircraft entered the runway edge grass and the propeller struck a runway light.  The aircraft came to rest with no damage to the airframe or landing gear.  Upon exiting the aircraft; it was observed that the wind had changed direction and the landing had been executed with a 10-15 knot tailwind. ATC immediately changed the traffic pattern to begin landing aircraft on runway YYR after my excursion.
1889438,Received information 10 minutes after push back that HAZMAT was not secured. HAZMAT not listed since it was less than 2.5lbs of dry ice.Flight came back to the gate.
1889455,737-700 pushed back from gate to spot Bravo. Employee followed procedures to remove bypass pin when brakes were set per policy and procedure. Employee put the pin in left gloved hand then proceeded to disconnect the wireless connector that allows communications to the cockpit and the push back driver. Employee put this device in left gloved hand as well. Employee then walked from right side of nose to left side of nose and headed back to gate.Once back at gate was putting equipment back into the lead box and realized that something was missing. Employee retraced steps and saw the bypass pin on the tarmac to just about 3 ft. from the left of the nose gear. The aircraft had already powered engines and was in the process of turning to the right because there was an Airbus directly in front of him.  Immediately notified the lead to get hold of supervisor or control center to have the aircraft stop or return to gate or something so that the bypass pin could be safely retrieved and removed from being a hazard on the tarmac/taxi area.The Captain/Crew did not get notified to stop and as the plane continued around the Airbus the bypass pin was ingested into the #1 engine. Employee and other members of the ground crew saw the bypass pin get lifted from the ground and into the engine and the noise that ensued. The flight had taxied away and when finally returned to gate; Maintenance met the aircraft.
1913818,Taxiing out of ZZZ1 we noticed that the 'LEFT COMM PANEL PTT' was inoperative since Tower was calling the airplane a couple of times to give us climb instructions. Eventually the Captain realized of the malfunction and used the PTT from the yoke. During climb and already past FL180 the Captain also noticed the standby attitude indicator showing 400 ft. above normal altitude and he was showing me where I can find the altimeter reading limitations on the Fault Reporting Code manual. During cruise he also noticed that the radar was showing a lot of 'noise' on the display and we tried to troubleshoot by resetting with no success. The Captain was filling out the [form] with the faults that we had encountered so far while I was still at the controls when he noticed that the 'return to seat' light in the galley came on. He expressed his concern out loud to which I responded that from training I remember that one of the reason the light comes on is because of a depressurization of the 'main cargo deck'. He then looked at the pressurization gauges and read out loud 'Cabin 10K ft.; differential 3.8'; a couple of seconds later it dawned on him what he had just said and immediately proceeds to pull the oxygen mask; don it and broadcast PAN PAN with ZZZ Center. It took me a couple of seconds later to do the same because I just couldn't believe what was happening but shortly after I don my mask and established comms the 'CABIN ALTITUDE' master warning and EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) came on. ZZZ instructed to descend to 16;000 ft. all while I pulled the thrust levers to idle; speed breaks extended; FLCH; and set manually the speed to MMO and the Captain was reading the checklist out loud. After we concluded the checklist and still in a descent we were doing about 5;000 ft./min the Captain noticed that the cabin was staying at 10;000 ft. but the differential was slowly coming down. When we level off at 16;000 ft. ZZZ asked if we wanted to descend to 10;000 ft. The Captain consulted with me and I agreed since we had no high terrain in the area based on the depiction of the terrain feature. We continued the [descent] to 10;000 ft.; removed our masks when we leveled off and the Captain transferred left comm to me so he could talk to [dispatch].ZZZ was asking information about our intentions to what I responded to give us a few minutes since the Captain was conferring with [dispatch] on the next best course of action. I also decided to pull the speed back to 250 KTS to help with the fuel consumption in case we decided to continue to ZZZ2. We had about 30k lbs. of fuel and were burning about 9;700 pounds per hour. Distance to ZZZ2 was showing about 315 nm. ZZZ handed me off to ZZZ3 Approach.The Captain finished his conference with [maintenance] and informed me that they have decided to divert to ZZZ3 since the software used to determine fuel burn numbers wouldn't give information below FL200. I mentioned that we had enough gas to go to ZZZ2 and since the weather was perfect I didn't have a problem continuing but he reaffirmed that without 'official numbers' the safest course of action was to divert. He contacted ZZZ3 Approach; informed our decision. While he was still with [dispatch] I had already pulled out info of frequencies; altitudes; got the ATIS for ZZZ3 and were pretty much ready to brief and run checklists. I did request the Captain to ask for delayed vectors because I didn't feel comfortable with the rush to get us down since we were not in an urgency anymore. When on final approach we noticed the LAND 2; NO LAND 3 on the auto land status. We made an uneventful landing in ZZZ3 and Tower gave us an apron on [Taxiway] 1 to wait for further instructions. During interaction with Airport Authorities I provided some input on informing them of the nature of our cargo (flammable) and seal the airplane since Captain was security coordinator in a situation like this.
1929353,While doing a touch and go at ZZZ airport; the student started to takeoff without getting the carb heat in and the flaps up. I reminded the student that we needed to get the flaps up first and told him to release the back pressure and pull out the power for an aborted takeoff/full stop taxi back. There was a miscommunication with the student and he did not pull the power out right away. We both got fixated on what he was doing with the controls and not where we were going and that there was left rudder being put in. We went off the left side of Runway XX into the grass. No damage to the aircraft or persons occurred. I needed to have made my instruction more clear to him and taken the controls away from him sooner. It was too early to be doing touch and goes and we should have practiced more with stabilized approaches; go-arounds; and full stop taxi backs first. We needed to brief more about aborted takeoffs and the terminology used for putting power in/out/and idle.
1927497,Upon departing the FBO I taxied into a cone. The prop hit the cone with no decrease in RPM. Upon inspection of the prop and finding no issues I departed. The cone did not cause damage to any other aircraft or equipment. I was at an unfamiliar airport and did not receive the customary support from the FBO for parking or departure. However; the mistake was all my own and I plan to be more careful going forward.
1876863,Flight was supposed to be approximately 2.5 hours from ZZZ-ZZZ1. Immediately after takeoff from ZZZ; I (Pilot Flying) realized the electronic trim for the horizontal stabilizer was not working. It was working prior to takeoff and was used to set the proper stab trim. The First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) tried his yoke trim switches; and they also did not work. We ran the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative checklist; which restored our ability to trim the stabilizer using manual trim. A secondary effect of losing electronic elevator trim is also losing the autopilot. We decided the best course of action was to return to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ for an uneventful landing. Airplane was then turned over to Maintenance for repair.No known causal factors. We had been de-iced prior to takeoff; but there is no reason to believe there was any ice buildup or contact with the deicing equipment since the manual trim worked fine.My opinion is this event was the result of a mechanical malfunction. Sometimes complex machines have malfunctions; so I have no suggestions to prevent a similar event in the future.
1919803,On short final for Runway 27 on the RNP-M in SAN. Shortly after my FO (First Officer) called 500 [ft.]; we heard ATC clear an aircraft for immediate takeoff off Runway 27. I instantly conferred whether there was an aircraft on the runway with my First Officer as I could not see anything. We had a very brief conversation about it; questioning if we had a wrong frequency in Comms 2; that had come in for a different airport as we could not see another aircraft on the runway; and it seemed unlikely that such clearance was being issued given how close to touchdown we were. I suddenly noticed the center lights of the runway disappearing and reappearing; subsequently realizing there was in fact an aircraft taking off. Within a second or two; ATC issued a go-around; which I was anticipating at that point and executed instantly. ATC told us to start a left turn almost immediately; which I did as I was concerned about climbing over the departing aircraft.There was a bit of confusion on the heading ATC wanted us to fly on our part; so I continued the turn over the bay where I knew I would have the best visibility due to the lack of city lights. The go-around was uneventful; and ATC gave us further climb and heading instructions putting [us] on the downwind for Runway 27. We ran through our procedures to get the aircraft set up for landing on Runway 27; and landed uneventfully.
1912738,I was working the ZZZ Sector with some afternoon arrival traffic. I received a handoff from ZZZ1 with Aircraft X. I told them to expect the RNAV Runway XXL and descended them to 050. I then went back and cleared Aircraft X to cross ZZZZZ at or above 047; cleared ZZZ2 approach. The pilot read it back correctly. I subsequently slowed the aircraft after the clearance and read back. During my scan; I saw Aircraft X at 042 outside of ZZZZZ in a 044 MVA. I issued a low altitude alert and asked if they had the field in sight. They did so I cleared them for a visual approach to eliminate the MVA requirements; Aircraft X proceeded on the visual; ended up calling traffic ahead in sight; and followed them in landing without incident. This is a tough event to prevent a reoccurrence of from the Controller side because I verified that the read back was in fact correct; even listening to the audio after the fact. Somehow in the cockpit the restriction got lost as far as I can tell. Luckily in this instance; I observed the aircraft descending below my issued restriction quickly and ensured that VMC allowed them to be on a visual approach. The low altitude alert was definitely necessary to prevent a further descent. I will continue to scan at all times to continue to try to catch these errors in the future; and issue alerts as necessary to correct instances like this.
1888970,On Date at approximately XA:00; while PIC on a solo flight in my Extra 300L; I had a rolling electrical failure (first on one device; then sequentially lost use of other devices) about a minute; or so after take-off from ZZZ Runway XX with a left crosswind turnout to the Southwest. Conditions were VMC; sky clear; 10+ miles of visibility. Here is what happened: Shortly after take-off; I noticed that I lost the ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) traffic feature on my G430; so I recycled it; but when the G430; including Com. 1; didn't come back on after 30-60 seconds; I knew something was amiss.  Initially; after the Com. 1 failure; my Com. 2 was lit up; but by the time I went to use it to call the Tower; Com. 2 did not work; I then noticed the Communications panel was dead and then the LED lights on my Com. 2 went out so; I knew it too was dead. It was at this point I realized I had lost my radios and all other electricals as my tachometer too was dead. I ran a quick check of all circuit breakers; all the while maintaining control of the plane and looking for other traffic. All breakers were in; so the only prudent choice for mine and others safety; was to head back to ZZZ (NORDO). Upon reaching midfield to the West of the Tower; at about 1000 ft. AGL; I then circled around in this area to the West of the Tower about 1000 ft. or so away from it and wagged my wings over and over for what seemed like 2-3 minutes or so. To be safe; I did not want to overfly the field because the area to the East of the field there is an aerobatic box that is quite often active and there are helicopters and military aircraft at the field as well as a Company facility. I figured the Tower would see and hear me where I was and could also see me on radar. After some time; I saw no light gun from the Tower at all; so I figured that maybe it was broken. I then went southbound in the downwind towards left pattern for Runway XX and before turning base; I saw that a Aircraft X or similar aircraft was on a take-off roll; so I went back to the area West of the Tower and did some more circling and wing wagging. I was concerned; but not panicked; that this could develop into an emergency; if this electrical failure was the beginning of more going wrong with my plane; (maybe an engine failure; fire; etc.) if there was a short of some kind that might also take the magnetos off-line. So; I wanted to stay close to the field/Runways. Then being in the area to the West of the Tower; after I saw the Aircraft X take-off and away from the area and saw no planes on base; or approach; I figured it was most prudent to bring my plane in for a landing (as the AIM says with a com. failure; 'land as soon as practicable'). As I was already in the downwind for a left base; I kept close to the runway/did a moderately short approach; in case I had an engine failure. This was all the while I was pretty sure that the Tower must have seen me with all my extensive circling and wing wagging. As I was NORDO; I got off on [taxiway] A3 and then taxied back to the ramp. As soon as I exited the plane; I called the Control Tower to let them know I had a total electrical failure and the person I spoke to said given the conditions I did a good job. I gave them my name; tail number and phone number to file in their report to the FAA. They said the total electrical failure would explain why they didn't see me on ADS-B. I was surprised to find out that they didn't have radar at all to see planes with INOP ADS-B. Since the event this is what has been done. The aircraft was grounded and sent to maintenance shop to replace the battery; starter motor; alternator and to check all electrical systems. Return to service logbook sticker will show replaced battery; alternator; starter; etc. What I will do in the future: Carry a handheld battery operated radio and the control tower frequencies in for departure and arrival airports in my phone.
1887607,On Date I was operating Aircraft X for jump operations at ZZZZ.Prior to the incident I (PIC (Pilot in Command)); was told that 13 Skydivers would be practicing for a big way formation jump. There was a minor brief with the Coordinator for the formation jump wherein he advised me that they were planning on having up to 10 Skydivers hanging off of the jump step and in the door situated aft and on the left side of the aircraft. I advised the Jump Coordinator of the following:'This won't work and it's not a good idea. Here's what I mean - If we use a weight estimate of 170 lbs. per skydiver; multiplied by 10 bodies; we get a conservative estimate of 1700 lbs. aft of the center of lift or balance point. This will put the aircraft well out of the CG limitations. If this happens I'll lose pitch control of the aircraft and there's a very good chance the aircraft will stall; and possibly go into a spin.' The Jump Coordinator responded: 'OK; we'll figure out a different configuration.'My response: 'Listen; if your guys don't get this right this bird's going to drop a wing; stall and there's a good chance the aircraft will enter a spin right on top of you guys.'The Jump Coordinator though that I was joking as he responded with a laugh. I replied with a reaffirmation of my previous statement: 'hey man; I'm dead serious! If this happens and that wing drops; you guys need to get the hell out of dodge quick because there's a good chance the plane's coming right on top of you!'Prior to the skydivers boarding I warned my Trainee (who was observing on this flight from the right seat):'If these guys screw this up we're going to get some spin recovery practice... I'm hoping this won't be the case but I'm going to plan for it and carry extra speed as well as trim the elevator forward on the jump run. This way; if we get out of CG and I start to lose pitch authority; it'll buy us a few extra seconds. Just be ready because these guys lose 98% of their brain cells once they get around airplanes... Point being - let's hope for the best but expect the worst.'Takeoff and climb out were normal with no anomalies. At 12;500 ft. I flashed the standby red-light in the back of the aircraft. Two miles prior to the exit point; I turned on the red standby light which gives the 'OK' to open the jump door. 1 mile prior to the exit point; I configured the airplane with 20 degrees of flaps; pulled the power back to 1000 lbs. of torque; pulled the propeller back to the 1st detente; trimmed the nose forward; and put the aircraft in slow flight pitching for an 80-85 kt. airspeed (roughly 10 kts. faster than usual) .From there I turned on the green light signifying to the jumpers that they were clear to exit the aircraft. Immediately; the skydivers began moving from the front of the aircraft and positioning themselves on the step outside of the airplane. A few seconds past when I told my Trainee: 'look; I'm full forward on the yoke; I have no more pitch authority and I'm out of of elevator trim. At that very moment two more skydivers rushed to join the group already at the rear of the airplane. The airplane began to pitch up and yaw to the left. I immediately came in with a slight amount of right/opposite rudder to bring that retreating wing forward; and back into the relative wind. About two seconds later the left wing stalled and the aircraft rolled aggressively into a roughly 80 degree bank to the left which threw the skydivers off of the outside step. Once the skydivers were off of the plane; control was restored back to the pilot (me); I rolled the wings level; took out the rudder input and recovered from the stall and leveled the aircraft off in order to stop it from accelerating past 130 kts.From there; I made my descent to land and all else was fine.
1918784,I was operating flight XXX; ZZZ [to] ZZZ1 on Date. The crew and I were waiting for the aircraft at the gate. Once the aircraft arrived and deplaned; a FA (Flight Attendant) came up and told us about how the APU was inoperative and effected their flight out of ZZZ2. She also stated how there was a smell in the aircraft; but didn't know if it was associated with a fume event or just a funky smell. The FO (First Officer) and I went down to the aircraft and put our luggage into place. Upon entering the cockpit; both the FO (First Officer) and I commented on the smell. The smell did not seem to at first be that of 'smelly socks' but more of what the FO and I described as a well used horse stall. Thinking it was just remnants of a previous crew; we went on with our checks. The FA's got on the aircraft and while preparing for the flight made a comment about the smell. Upon hearing this I walked the aircraft trying to smell for a different smell to see if it was a fume event or just a smell. After getting back up to the cockpit; I asked the FO if he felt any different. He said he felt a little off. At this time; I then told the entire crew to get off the airplane until we figured out the source. It wasn't until the crew was off of the airplane did I start to feel a little light headed. That was when I knew it was a fume event. I then got the logbook and the FO notified Operations that we had a fume event. We waited on MX (Maintenance) to show and I then was asking the crew if anyone felt sick. At first; the FA's didn't say anything about feeling sick. They decided to go back up to the gate and wait inside. I obtained the number for [contract medical service] and advised the lead FA that if anyone of them felt sick to call [the contract medical service] and to also advise their Supervisor. MX had shown up and was addressing the problem. During this; I called [the medical service] and after my phone call with them; they advise me to be checked out by medical professionals. Scheduling then called me because I had timed out and they released me from the flight. I left to seek medical care.
1915775,A few minutes after the plane landed the ramp closed. 10 or 15 minutes after the plane pulled up to the gate the remote van came and parked the plane. As soon as the plane parked customer service pulled the bridge up to the plane and begun to deplane. There was no tail stand and the truck did not put any chocks up to the airplane. A few moments after the bridge was pulled up the nose began to bounce up and down. I called the sup and let them know what was happening and the sup instructed them to stop deplaning.
1872577,Taxiing from gate; approaching A7; ATL Ground cleared us A7 A 26R; taxi speed 15 kts. Fire Truck approaching from the right; high rate of speed crossed in front of us on service road. If I had not stood on the brakes a collision would have occurred. Fire Truck never slowed. Explained the situation to Ground Controller and said that it happens a lot. Fire Truck was returning to station. Did NOT have emergency lights on. Fire Truck driver ignoring ground procedures. Have fire truck driver abide by ground vehicle rules.
1905731,The Captain was flying the leg; and on a vectored base leg to join the approach into ZZZ. ATC asked if we saw the airport and traffic at our 12 o'clock. We called the airport in sight; but not the traffic and we were cleared for the approach for XXR. We dialed in the lower altitude and started descending on the glide slope. At around 3300-3400 ft. we were asked if we had the traffic in sight; we said no and we were told to maintain 4000 ft. I asked if they wanted us to climb to 4000; and we got a vector of 300 away from the traffic and off the approach. Then ATC made the comment it looked like we were on the localizer; and we were told to continue the approach. We rejoined the localizer and continued descending; and it was when we were about 200- 300 ft. below the glide slope that the Captain said something wasn't working right; and added power to climb out. ATC called us with a terrain alert; and we climbed to correct and the Captain finished the approach hand flown. Unclear and misinterpreted instructions by ATC caused us to change automation modes very rapidly in the terminal environment. We think that this resulted in us being in an undesired automation state; and since we were very task saturated; we didn't notice that we were not in the correct mode when the incident occurred. When things get as hairy as they did there; then looking back at it the smartest thing would have been to go around as soon as we were confused about ATC instructions and intentions. It would have given us time and let up on the workload that we were experiencing. Verbalizing task saturation would be good to do as well; and to be more aware of the saturation levels that can happen in the terminal environment.
1877870,After taking off from ZZZ-ZZZ1; we were not able to retract the landing [gear]. At around 35 feet with positive rate after calling for gear up; I tried to put the landing gear lever in the up position and was unsuccessful. We notified ATC and told them what had happened and that we wanted to level off at 3;000 feet and get some vectors so we can complete our required checklist. We ran the QRH and decided to return to ZZZ because there was no (LG WOW SYS FAIL MESSAGE DISPLAYED) so the QRH directed us to land at the nearest suitable airport. We completed the QRH and notified Dispatch of our intentions. We also briefed the flight attendants and passengers about the current situation. We never [requested priority handling] or gave any brace commands because the QRH never called for it and furthermore everything was under control and completely safe. While returning back to ZZZ; I suggested that we held for a few minutes to burn off some fuel and avoid an overweight landing. Once we were below max landing weight; we decided to contact ATC for the ILS XX. We landed without any further incident. On the ground we informed Dispatch and Maintenance Control of what occurred and Maintenance responded that they already knew because their system indicated there was something wrong with the nose wheel sensor. We briefed the Gate Agent and passengers and told them that there will be a replacement aircraft landing soon. After we swapped aircraft we departed without any further incident.
1915614,Aircraft X check on frequency at FL390 requesting FL350. I told him I have his request. I called for control. I couldn't descend to FL350 yet because of traffic at FL370 within 3-4 miles. Aircraft X said he needs to descend now so I turn him; assign him FL380; and call the ZZZ1 traffic for him. He tells me he's looking for the traffic and reads back descending to FL380. I see his data block update to FL377 and ask him about his descent. He tells me he can't maintain the altitude and is going to FL350. I turn him again but lose separation with the other traffic. I had about 4.5 miles going through the altitude of FL370. I ask what the problem is; and he says he's having a pressurization issue but that FL350 should be fine for now. But soon after requests to go lower and eventually we [gave him priority handling]. Just better communication. He said he would like to descend now but did not tell me the reason. If I knew there was an issue I could have given more urgency to vector and descend. I understand it's a possible situation and a pilot is worried about flying his aircraft first. Maybe I could have prevented the separation loss.
1893927,Misread planned dangerous good (DG) summary for final planned dangerous good summary and push back without final. Discovery was made when final weight manifest was sent to printer that included timestamp of when final DG was sent. Contacted Operations and obtained an electronic copy of final DG summary. Flight operated on time.
1890341,On visual approach backed by the ILS into ZZZ XXR; very gusty crosswinds on final. Final configuration checked and checklist complete; at slightly under 100 knots on short final near the overrun; a GPWS warning announced. After assessing glide path was normal; descent rate was normal; no terrain conflict was in sight and airspeed was fluctuating due to gusty crosswind at that moment we felt the we were still in a safe position to land in the touchdown zone and the decision to land was safer than going around with a wide body aircraft turning right over the departure end of the runway. PF (pilot flying) landed in the touchdown zone and brought the aircraft to taxi speed and exited the runway. During the debrief we believe the GPWS warning to be either erroneous or related to the very gusty erratic crosswinds.
1916405,I was outside on [the gate] wing walking on the Captain side; and saw a black passenger bag laying inside the envelope. I tried to move it before the push back as far out as I could. I took a few steps forward to wing walk and turned around and realized that the wing goes out of the safety envelope. I threw up the X but the local didn't see it in time with the engine to my right and the catering truck to my left. The wingtip got stuck on the top to the catering truck. When I turned around to face the local and realized the wing tip was going over the side of the truck I threw up the X. I saw the plane wing grazed the top of the catering truck. I thought that the safety envelope line was correct and that the wings fell inside the envelope; until the push back. During the push back is when the event occurred and it showed that the plane wing fell outside of the line. Crew Chief notified management.
1907482,After takeoff the landing gear would not retract. A Gear Tilt message was displayed on the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System. Also gear door and gear lever disagree messages became displayed. We informed departure of the problem and were given vectors while we ran the appropriate checklists. The airplane never exceeded 265 knots during the flight. We consulted with dispatch; the Duty Pilot; Maintenance Control and the mechanic onboard the aircraft. We came to the conclusion that the best course of action was to divert to ZZZ.Fuel was dumped in the ZZZ area; while in coordination with air traffic control. We proceeded to land uneventfully in ZZZ. Upon arrival in ZZZ Maintenance informed us that a body gear door had separated from the aircraft. I believe it was on the same gear as the tilt message. We did experience some vibration in the airframe at all airspeeds after departure. The vibration remained constant at all airspeeds. The vibration did cease and it is my belief that that is when the door departed the airframe.Gear would not retract after normal takeoff. Gear tilt message. After debrief with other crew members we agreed that the event was handled fairly well. All of us had minor suggestions as to what we do differently if the same event were to occur again; but overall I/we feel the event was handled okay.
1916861,After parking on spot 1 and when we were in the midst of our shut down flows; the parking brake released. I had my feet on the brakes on the rudder pedals; but apparently not enough as the aircraft rolled a couple of inches. In fact; when it happened; I thought to myself; 'Good thing I have my feet on the brakes.'; and wasn't aware we had rolled at all until my First Officer asked; 'Are we rolling?' By the time she asked; the aircraft had stopped and she noticed her brakes were ineffective as my feet were still holding pressure on the brakes.
1909753,During climb out from ZZZZ-ZZZ; CAS (Crew Alert System) message ENG2: PARAM EXCEED annunciation came on; Immediately reduced power and accomplished abnormal checklist; continued to destination because checklist stated no further action required as all parameters were returned to normal. After arrival in ZZZ; contacted Company Maintenance and advised of occurrence. After discussion of issue with Maintenance on phone and other pilot it was decided that since there were no faults recorded in the CMC; no log book discrepancy write up or Maintenance would be required prior to next flight. While investigating a separate aircraft discrepancy that occurred on flight ZZZ-ZZZ1. Company Mechanic advised me that a write up is required for the ENG2: PARAM EXCEED. We then contacted NAME and NAME1 to discuss issue. Aircraft was taken out of service; discrepancies were written up and maintenance arrangements were made. Subsequent investigation revealed that the exceedance is within the transient limit and no maintenance action is required.There should be a CAS amber warning prior to reaching limits not after. A call out and response for power reduction after flaps clean up. If foreseen; pre takeoff brief to include possible distractions at low altitudes during climb out and actions to counter. Example; avoiding Towering Cumulus or VFR traffic.
1926988,On take off; near Vr the First Officer alerted me to the fact that the Right (#2) Engine EGT was starting into the red. We did not have any ECAMs or Alerts because I'm sure they were inhibited. We also did not notice any indications of compressor stall. While continuing a normal takeoff and climb out; I eased the Right (#2) power lever back just a little out of the FLEX position and the First Officer stated that the EGT returned to the green. The EGT was probably slightly in the red for approximately 5 seconds. I then eased the right (#2) power lever back into the FLEX position and the EGT remained in the green and we climbed out normally. The remainder of the flight the engine had all normal indications. After landing and parking at the Gate in ZZZ; I made a logbook write up and called maintenance. To be honest; I have no idea why the engine began to overheat. The temperature was warm outside for ZZZ1; but it wasn't extreme. And we were using FLEX thrust; not TOGA thrust! Maintenance needs to look at this engine to make sure it is preforming properly; so that it doesn't happen to another crew.
1889016,Departed ZZZ on direct flight to ZZZ1; VFR. After takeoff heard position report of local RV-7 on assumed VFR approach to ZZZ - position report indicated '10 miles South of ZZZ airport; inbound for Runway XX'. My position report indicated 'Departing ZZZ to the south-east'. Position reports indicate separation of several miles and that aircraft should not be a factor. Approximately 5-6 miles from ZZZ at 2000 ft. the inbound aircraft passed directly in front of us on descent into ZZZ. No evasive action was required. Neither I nor a passenger with me who also holds a PPL saw the aircraft until it was almost directly in front of us; passing left to right and descending. Discussion with the other pilot was had and we both agreed that the other plane was obscured by the ceiling and A-pillar of the aircraft windshield until it was almost in front of us. I leveled at 2500 ft. and continued on my flight. I called ATC about 2 minutes later to obtain clearance into the ZZZ1 Class C. Approach made no mention of the near-miss and I do not believe that they noticed it. I did not mention the near-miss to ATC but upon landing and researching NMAC regulations under section 3 determined that I likely should have asked to make an NMAC report. After discussion of the situation with my CFI it was decided to make this report and to also alert the FSDO when they open in the AM to file a proper NMAC report.
1905794,As we took off from ZZZ on our way to ZZZ1 climbing through 12;000 I noticed a strange smell. Shortly after; we both noticed smoke in the Flight Deck. While the Captain (CA) and I were processing what was going on and subsequently calling for the Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) SMOKE FIRE FUMES checklist and doing the memory items; the Flight Attendant (FA) called using the EMER call button. After putting our O2 masks on; we answered the call and she said they were also having smoke in the cabin. We said okay and that we were working on it and to keep us updated with any changes. At this point I was running the checklist while the CA was flying. We leveled off at 17;000. The checklist called to [request landing priority] and land. At this point we requested to go back to ZZZ1.After running through the first half of the smoke fire fumes checklist we got to the part where it said to deploy the rat and turn off integrated drive generators (IDGs). The CA and I discussed it and we did not see the need to do this as the smoke began to clear. Therefore; we reverted back to the smoke evacuation checklist. ZZZ Approach gave us vectors for the ILS XR approach. We coordinated with ATC to exit the runway and have crash fire and rescue inspect the aircraft from the outside. After they cleared us we continued to the gate safely. Provide more guidance as to which specific scenario it would be best to run the smoke fire fumes vs smoke evacuation.
1908651,After push back; the Ramp Crew advised me to set the brakes. I thought l had; however I noticed one of the ramp crew waving their wands. I then noticed that the airplane was slowly moving and immediately applied the brakes. No one was hurt and no equipment was damaged.This event has really shook me up. I was sure I had set the brakes; but the parking brake worked correctly for the rest of the flight; so obviously I did not. Contributing to this event was a dark ramp and that I had the dome light on in the cockpit.Obviously; attention to detail on my part. I will also have the dome light off during push back.
1896761,While established in the traffic pattern; we were following the aircraft ahead of us; another C172 at normal sequencing. Following our touch and go on Runway XXL; a Student Pilot in a C172 was cleared for takeoff behind us. The Student Pilot behind us lost situational awareness and turned crosswind early without first clearing the turn visually. This led to us (established in the downwind) getting overtaken by the Student Pilot in the downwind. After becoming visual with the aircraft overtaking us; I executed a right 360 degree turn in order to establish a safe distance between us and the other aircraft. Tower then provided the amended sequencing to the Runway; and the rest of the flight went normally.
1898391,Destination showed 0 SM in ATIS while enroute. Crew informed me that they were planning to set up for a CAT II approach. At this point I rechecked all NOTAMs and saw the 5G NOTAM. I looked at the release and saw that there was a remark that ZZZ AMOC (Alternative Method of Compliance) was approved for Runway XXL. I messaged the crew to tell them that I showed we could only do CAT II on XXL. They responded 'that's what we are seeing also'. A few minutes later I decided to check the AMOC just to be sure. The latest version I had was not searchable and was alphabetical by airport name; not identifier so when I didn't see ZZZ as I expected I would because of the release remarks; I immediately emailed the duty managers and asked for a searchable document in case the airport name was different or I was missing something. I was sent an Excel document and ZZZ was not in it so I immediately sent a message to the crew that the remarks on the release were incorrect and we could not do a CAT II approach to any runway in ZZZ. At this time they were on final approach. They were able to land and I became curious about what their 5G uplink from Company had told them about which runways were in the AMOC. I looked in the ACARs traffic log and saw it told them 'RWY XXL 5G NOTAM IN EFFECT. SOP 5G POLICIES APPLY. RWY XXR 5G NOTAM IN EFFECT. SOP 5G POLICIES APPLY.' I referenced memo number X which told me this message meant 'All runways requested are NOT on the AMOC and FOM/SOP 5G restrictions apply'. This told me that their 5G uplink from Company matched the AMOC but the remark on the release did not. I immediately emailed the duty managers and informed the other dispatchers of the discrepancy. The CA (Captain) called me after the flight and I apologized that the automated release remark was wrong but mentioned that I saw the 5G uplink message was correct. The CA said that he thought the 5G uplink was just telling him that there WAS a 5G NOTAM not that he couldn't do a CAT II to those runways. I agreed that I found the wording of the uplink confusing too but referred him to the memo that explained the meaning of the various messages. I asked him if he ended up shooting the CAT II approach and he said he did not. I decided to file a report because the automated remark on my release was incorrect and I told the CA we were AMOC approved for that runway based on it before I verified it in the AMOC. The incorrect remark combined with the Captain's confusion about the meaning of the 5G uplink message created a situation where we nearly shot a CAT II approach to a runway that could have had 5G interference.The process we use involving release remarks to identify AMOC runways continues to fail us. I have emails showing that every time we have gotten a new AMOC the release remarks have been found to be incorrect for one or more airports. Last month this was not discovered until 20 days into the revised AMOC. On many occasions the subsequent AMOCs are removing runways; giving us further limitations to operations so it's definitely a safety concern when they are not updated. I would personally rather not have a remark on there at all than have the information be incorrect so maybe we should remove the remarks completely since our administrators cannot manage to keep them up to date. The process to needs to be fully audited; changes made to ensure compliance; and continually spot-checked.
1876085,This was the first flight after significant maintenance work on the field at ZZZ; with my autopilot and my turn coordinator both acting up. The shop replaced an autopilot servo and the turn coordinator and returned the plane to service on Date.I did an especially thorough pre-flight and run up but everything checked out. I added a pint of engine oil supplement after a recent oil change during pre-flight. The new turn coordinator worked in taxi and the autopilot worked on the ground. I filed IFR to ZZZ1 and back for a shakeout cruise and proceeded as planned.Approach asked if I was planning approaches at ZZZ1 and I told them I was just doing the shakeout flight; so flying around would be fine. Approach gave me vectors west as I ran through flows; making sure things looked good in the autopilot.About 5 minutes into the flight as I leveled out at 4;000 ft; I heard an alarm or alert and the standby alternator light was activated. I smelled hot electrical smell or smoke and started troubleshooting the primary alternator. There wasn't that much load to shed; but I turned off running lights and strobes and I cycled the alternator on and off. When I turned it off; the alarm or feedback through my headset went away; it came back on when I flipped the primary back on. I cycled it a few times; and the sound eventually faded.I asked to return to ZZZ and soon after [requested priority handling] with Approach. The electrical smell was still there; but wasn't getting worse. Approach asked me about my gear and I was able to deploy it; but I should have waited until closer to the field. Still; once they were down and I had three green lights indicated; the gear was staying down.Approach passed me back to Tower; which cleared me for landing on [Runway] XX Right. I asked for and got [Runway] XX Left; because it was closer to parking but also the nearest runway to me. Tower confirmed gear down and I landed uneventfully. About 50 yards down from my tie-down; a pilot was watching me come in and said he smelled the plane but neither of us smelled smoke after I shut down; so probably something electrical.I'll put the plane back in for maintenance to look at next week; with particular focus on the voltage regulator; alternator and battery.Reviewing the flight and areas of improvement; I should have [requested priority handling] more forcefully. I made the right decision to return to ZZZ to land; it was as close as other options and has services on the field. I also dropped the gear too far out; worried that I wouldn't have power to get them down otherwise -- I should have maintained the slicker plane and dropped the gear closer to landing; as usual.
1892744,Aircraft X had a engine change on the right motor. On the aircraft first departure the flight crew experienced high vibration on the right motor. Was just notified by [Engineering] so awaiting for more information at this time; and will provide [information] in the [company reporting form] as we progress with the report.
1908811,I contacted the ZZZ ground controller and informed them of my intentions to depart to the North West on a flight to the X area and then continue north to ZZZ1 airport; and then gave the current ATIS info.  I was cleared to taxi to runway ZZ.  Upon contacting the tower for a takeoff clearance; I was cleared for takeoff and given instructions for a right turn to the North West. I cleared the runway and turned right to the North West per clearance instructions. After clearing the horizontal and vertical limits of the delta airspace I requested permission for a frequency change. The tower controller approved my request for frequency change. I then changed frequency to ZZZ approach to request flight following and permission to fly a sight seeing path over the X area. Upon switching channels; I attempted to contact the ZZZ approach controller three separate times; between other aircraft transmissions; with no response.  The approach controller responded on the fourth attempt. There was never any concern with my position. After I was given a squawk code; I instructed to remain outside of the Bravo airspace; but I was not given a clear clearance into the X [area] airspace ('not approved or denied.....') per the controller.At this point I had a large cloud to my left; Bravo above and to my right and a layer of clouds in front of me that I could not climb above without violating the Bravo airspace. I could not turn left without violating VFR cloud clearance spacing.  The only option left was to descend below the clouds in front of me before breaching cloud clearance. My descent apparently put me near the path of inbound traffic; that was on the other side of the clouds to my left which blocked my field of vision.  I never saw the traffic. Nor did I feel any wake/turbulence. I was never in the clouds. The air continued to be smooth.  Upon my return I was informed to contact the tower. I was then informed of a possible deviation.  I wasn't given a restriction to deviate from.For topics relevant - I was never given a heading; an altitude restriction; or informed of inbound traffic (at any point); by the ZZZ tower. I was on a climb and still below three thousand feet at the time of incident; therefore plus 500 did not apply.Prevention of recurrence - Aircraft departing airports that sit under a busy airspace should be given more attention; particularly when the departure direction keeps them engaged with multiple airspaces/special use areas; i.e. issue squawk code before clearance to takeoff.  Tower controllers should be informed of inbound / handoff traffic earlier.
1871669,The nose of the aircraft slide across the hold short line of [Runway] XXR. We advised Tower that the nose came across the hold short line. They issued an abort for a AC that was just issued a take off clearance on [Runway] XXR. The Tower thanked us for letting them know soon because the aircraft did not initiate the takeoff role. There was active snow and the hold short line and sine was covered in snow. As I preceded to stop the aircraft it was on ice so it slide to a stop just past the hold short line. The nose was between 5 feet to10 feet past the line The taxiing was difficult because of all the snow very slippery there were many times that the ac was slipping. It would have been nice if the taxi services were plowed and treated. The hold short sine was covered in snow and was difficult to see with the active snow.
1900799,ATC informed crew that [we would] have to remain at FL330 due to crossing traffic. After traffic passed overhead at approximately 2;000 feet above aircraft; ATC instructed [us] to climb and maintain FL370. At FL335 crew encountered the wake of the aircraft that had passed above. Aircraft snap rolled in a split second to an estimated 90 degrees to the right and pitched down 5 degrees. Crew recovered the aircraft extremely quickly and climbed to FL370. One passenger and aircraft technician were not buckled during the incident. No injuries or issues noted. Passengers were informed directly after encounter by the PIC as to what happened. Aircraft landed with further incidents. Maintenance team performed inspection for excessive G loading after landing as a precaution. Excessive G loading was not experienced during event. No damage was found.
1892245,On straight-out departure from CNO to ZZZ tonight just after sunset; I planned to climb to 2600 ft. MSL but misread the altimeter and leveled off at 1600 ft MSL. The dim lighting condition of the dusk and the shade on the altimeter due to the downward angle of my headlight were contributing factors. It was difficult to judge my altitude above ground when it is getting dark but not completely dark. As I approached Chino Hills; my GPS terrain warning system was activated which prompted me to re-check my altimeter reading and realized I was 1000 ft. below my planned altitude. I started climb out immediately and cleared the hills at 2500 ft. MSL. Although I may have stayed legal in this process by initiating the climb early enough before the rising terrain; the highest terrain in that area is ~1500 ft. MSL and I could have been involved in an accident if the error in my interpretation of the altimeter reading was not corrected promptly. In addition to cross checking instruments and pilot carefulness; an altitude check from the ATC (in this case the CNO Tower) acknowledging 'altitude 1600 ft.; frequency changed approved' if workload permits at dusk and night may be an additional preventative measure.
1884667,We had a smoke; odor & fumes event.This was not a A320 dirty socks event... on approach about 6;000 AGL I was notified of a faint electrical cord burning smell in aft cabin/galley area. I told the FA's (Flight Attendants) to keep me informed if it got worse and we would land in a few minutes.I was told upon arrival at the gate the FA's speculated it was probably smell from a passengers older laptop (FA's said faint electrical burn smell in back of aircraft that went away fairly fast). I speculated it was possibly pollution smell as we were on descent well below 10;000 ft.The FA's did report that they turned off the passenger charging ports when they detected the smell  I noted this in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry and report.No passengers or crew reported ill effects.Dispatch notified; Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry made; Smoke; Odor & Fumes form completed; and conference call with Maintenance Operations Center and [Checklist] completed upon arrival per Flight Operations Manual.
1918380,Drone lost link; no communication of this. Called ZZZ [TRACON] and they said it lost link. Recommendation- Communicate when a drone looses link.
1887319,We were flying a Visual Approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ. At about 1500 ft. MSL; Tower offered us Runway XXL; seemingly due to closeness of the aircraft in front of us. We were given 160 kts. until the marker; and had not configured to our final flaps (30). When we accepted Runway XXL; I 'went inside' and re-tuned to the Runway XXL Localizer. We made the 1000 ft. call; but had not fully configured. We got a 'Too Low; Flaps' alert and I selected flaps 30. I had 'tunnel vision'; focusing on the approach profile; which was normal; and didn't call for a go-around. We continued the approach and landing.Don't accept a runway change close in. We should have gone around when we got the alert. Aviate first; (complete configuring); then Navigate (I was distracted when I re-tuned and we really didn't need the new localizer to fly the visual); then Communicate (we both missed the Before Landing Checklist).
1930688,I arrived to work at XA00 for a midnight shift and assigned both North Control and CIC (Controller in Charge). Middletown Sector was staffed with a Controller only; not CIC capable in the Tracon. Prior to me signing on; Management was informed that one of the 4 midnight Controllers would not be in until XC00L. No Controllers or Supervisors were required to be held over to help out with the extraordinary departing traffic or TFR for the event. OSU; a Contract Federal Control Tower stayed open until XE00L; normally closes at XB00L; for the departing traffic. I also informed ZID Columbus sector that I had 35 departures proposed at XC00L and that it would be abnormal traffic for a typical [night]. They thanked me later that I informed them of the extra traffic as they help over extra Controllers to help them work the abnormal traffic. As a CIC; I had a report of a UAS in the TFR and was not able to relay the information to the DEN (Domestic Events Network) until 3 hours after the incident. Management should have been in the facility the entirety of the TFR to help with coordination. 3 Controllers for 3 positions as well as CIC is not a safe operation.
1923391,We were operating Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1; with a planned departure from Runway XX; due to the remaining runways being closed. Based on our performance calculations; we were legally and safely able to depart from that runway. We lined up on Runway XX and pushed up the thrust levers for takeoff. Just after commanding 'set thrust'; we received an aural alert stating 'CAUTION SHORT RUNWAY; SHORT RUNWAY'; as well as an EICAS message stating ' SHORT RUNWAY'. I immediately rejected the takeoff and retarded the thrust levers. We notified ATC; taxied clear of the runway; and found a spot to park the aircraft in coordination with ATC. After bringing the aircraft to a stop and completing the after landing checklist; I called the Duty Officer; who arranged a conference call with Captain. Based on their guidance; we temporarily selected the GND PROX RUNWAY OVRD switch to inhibit the RAAS (Runway Awareness and Advisory System) from giving us another alert on our subsequent takeoff. We completed the RTO checklist; as well as the after start and before takeoff checklist; verified our fuel was sufficient per the Flightplan/Release; and proceeded for another takeoff; which was uneventful. The RAAS on the B777 did what it was programmed to do; which is to alert the crew on a runway that has an available length of less than 7;500 ft. and the ground speed is greater than 40 kts. Runway XX at ZZZ has 7;278 ft. available. Not being familiar with this particular alert; I decided to reject the takeoff. I have never encountered this scenario in my six plus years of operating the B777; mainly because takeoffs on relatively short runways are rare; but I also do not recall seeing this scenario in any training environment. Maybe I missed it somewhere along the line; but it could be incorporated in a future syllabus.
1869925,On departure; [we] received [an] UNABLE RNP EICAS message. [We] believed [the message] to have been directly related to [a] local 5G NOTAM. Due to ATC informing us of [a] previous departure receiving effects of 5G-related malfunctions; [we] strongly believe this to be related to 5G near PDX. 5G near airports is a safety issue affecting automation and navigation.
1895081,After run-up and instrument check; departed ZZZ2; picked up IFR pop-up clearance to ZZZ3 with 3 souls on board and 4 hours fuel. Approximately halfway to our destination; we suffered complete electrical shut down. Momentarily losing control in a dark cockpit in IMC at night; we lost our checklist and flashlight to the floor. Making available the artificial horizon on Foreflight coupled with a stratus and opening Foreflight on iPhone with the use of an Approach plate into ZZZ1; the most direct route to final was made and so was a safe landing. Once on the ground; an immediate call to ATC was made with a report of the situation. In future; I will be wearing a head-light and my checklist secure within hands reach.
1891576,On take-off roll; the yaw damper engaged while in the off position and took control of rudder pedals. Take-off was aborted.
1891422,Just before departure; I received one of the newer NOTAC (Dangerous Goods Form) stating we were carrying two fire extinguishers. The airbill # was XXX-XXXXXXXX. I kept one copy and returned the other to the Ops Agent. Since I hadn't seen the new forms yet; I looked in my EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) for information and looked in the Manual. I found the relevant sections detailing the new form and when it was required. During cruise; I looked over the form again and saw a note in the corner saying that a note was required to be on the Release indicating Dispatch was aware of the HAZMAT and it was entered on the Dispatch Release for tracking purposes. Since this had not been done; when we landed I called Dispatch and we conferred. He said there was nothing to be done at that point and so I am filing a report as my action.
1932488,On an IFR flight plan into ZZZ with a student under the hood flying the LOC Y Runway XX low approach only. We were on approximately a 2 mile final and at this point a Citation which we had been tracking on our ADS-B was now same altitude off our right wing. They were previously issued an instruction to follow my aircraft and be number two for Runway XX into ZZZ. The Controller in the Tower was asking for multiple position reports from four aircraft inbound to the field. The Controller then issued the Citation a right 360 instruction and rejoin final for Runway XX. This instruction turned the Citation right over the top of my aircraft and the ADS-B in was alerting traffic was 400 ft. directly above us. Following that we were given the instruction to go missed at 800 ft. MSL and 1 mile for the runway. The student executed the missed as instructed by Tower and I informed the Tower of the near midair collision from my perspective and loss of separation. Though I believe the verbiage I used on the radio of the time was 'near miss.' I was then given a phone number to call once on the ground; which I did and spoke with the Controller on duty at the time of the near midair collision. When asked why he turned that aircraft into our flight path; his response was because he didn't want to turn them over the field and they were above us. This entire event could potentially been avoided if the Tower had radar; but they don't and rely on aircraft reporting their positions.
1907055,"At FL380 we received a CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING"". We immediately donned oxygen masks and established crew communications. The First Officer (FO) contacted ATC and I started an emergency descent. The FO ran the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist. As we were descending; the FO stated that the cabin altitude was 9000 ft. The CABIN ALTITUDE warning light remained on for about 8-10 minutes and then extinguished. I don't know exactly at what altitude this occurred; but I believe it was in the low teens. After the FO completed the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist; requested special handling and coordinated a divert into ZZZ. We accomplished all normal checklists and an uneventful ILS XXC approach and landing. We taxied into parking without incident. CABIN ALTITUDE 2 was enunciated on the status page. My ears popped as we received the warning and I felt slightly light headed as I was donning the oxygen mask. It went away shortly thereafter. Overall; I think we did a good job. I could have included the experienced jumpseater in the resolution of the event sooner. Once he was involved; some of the load was lifted from the FO and I. The other jumpseater was a new hire and this was his first flight on the 757."""
1893869,Departing [Runway] XXL ZZZ XA:35 on Date; a pair of military helicopters were passing left to right over Runway YY; below 100 ft.  We switched to tower frequency and received immediate takeoff clearance w/ traffic advisory on 6 mi final.  Not advised of military helicopters flying in formation over Runway and as we began takeoff roll we assumed they would hold short of XXL. As it became evident they would not; an abort was quickly considered; and I decided against it as we had entered the high speed regime.  We delayed rotation as we ran directly below the two military helicopters; had we rotated we would have collided.  Had the military helicopters had a midair; or descended we would have collided.  Contacted ZZZ Tower upon arrival in ZZZ1; Supervisor initiated an investigation. Received a call several hours later from supervisor requesting additional info.  Sup stated we should have been advised of military helicopters traffic; however a review of tapes indicated no advisory was made.  He further stated that evidence reviewed warranted further investigation; that he was writing a report and submitting it for review of procedures.If we were made aware of the traffic there is 0% chance we would have accepted the takeoff clearance. Suspect local controller was distracted by traffic on final.This was an unsafe operation; we should not have been given takeoff clearance; or advised of traffic so we could have not taken off.  In retrospect an immediate reject while still in low speed regime may have been the safest course of action; but we really expected them to hold short of our runway.
1876484,I was flying Aircraft X Cessna C-172N from ZZZ to ZZZ1. This was a personal flight to help maintain pilot proficiency. This is a rental aircraft from a flight school located at ZZZ. I did a full checklist-based pre-flight inspection; and normal takeoff from ZZZ. Flying my planned ZZZ1 RNAV XX approach; I proceeded to ZZZZZ; via ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ2 altitudes; and performed pre-landing checks. Had 4 white lights on the Runway XX PAPI; reduced power to lose altitude and speed. PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; I adjusted power and attitude to maintain glide slope. Checked airspeed was in the white; added first notch of flaps. Waited for aircraft to stabilize; verified PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; checked airspeed; adjusted power; added second notch of flaps. Almost immediately after second notch of flaps there was a loud bang; an immediate turn to the right; losing altitude very quickly. I corrected the uncommanded turn as much as possible; adjusted power to maintain altitude; looked for cause of problem. I noted one flap up; one down; and went around. Gained altitude; circled; and carefully explored controllability of the aircraft; 'no change' to the flaps was best for aircraft controllability. I landed without incident. In addition to the control system failure; the aircraft apparently suffered damage to the flaps. The flight school Mechanic; and the flight school; are not communicating with me; so I do not know the extent of the damage. A careful look at GPS data shows the aircraft was operated within limits; including Vfe; at all times prior to the incident. While this flight ended with a safe landing; for me this was a very close call; and caused me a few sleepless nights processing the event. I was mentally processing the event through the evening of Date1; and did not report the control system failure as quickly as I should have. It took me a while to overcome the seriousness of the event before I started my reporting responsibilities.Not having any communication or support from the flight school added additional delay. I was hoping for more information and cooperation from the school in the reporting process; as well as resolving what happened and how to avoid this situation in the future. I regret my delay and have reviewed my reporting duties and responsibilities as pilot in command to help ensure prompt reporting as required by regulations.
1913350,My student and I flew to ZZZ1 where we executed multiple successful touch and goes. We experienced very slight engine roughness during one of our takeoffs from ZZZ1 for a brief second due to my student advancing the throttle too quickly. Other than that; nothing was out of the ordinary. After a few landings we departed for one more touch and go at ZZZ.The approach into ZZZ was normal; and we had no indications of engine trouble. After touching down on Runway X; my student added full power to takeoff; forgetting to remove the flaps beforehand. Flaps were set 20 degrees; so our initial airspeed after lift off was very low (somewhere around 50 KIAS). This was the first moment I came on the controls; only to keep my student from pitching up anymore; and to keep him from removing the flaps before we were at a safe airspeed/altitude to do so. Still assisting my student with slight forward pressure on the yoke to allow airspeed to increase; I removed 10 degrees of flaps. As soon as I set the flaps from 20 to 10 degrees; the engine began running extremely rough and we experienced a partial loss of engine power. I cannot recall the exact altitude; but we were roughly 400-500 ft. AGL. So that leaves us at a very low altitude; with little to no runway left ahead of us; and a decrease in lift from reducing flaps just before the loss of power occurred.I immediately took over the flight controls. I noticed we went from a respectable climb rate to only maintaining level (at full power). I verified the fuel selector was on both; fuel mixture was full rich; and checked engine instruments. Oil pressure read slightly high; nothing catastrophic. However; the roughness sounded and felt to be getting worse; and I was not confident that we would be able to maintain altitude much longer. Due to our critically low altitude; and the uncertainty of whether or not the situation would deteriorate further in the next few moments; I made the decision to execute a precautionary landing; while the possibility of landing on a runway still existed. I informed ZZZ Tower that we were experiencing engine roughness and stated that I was turning around to land Runway XY. At the time I made that call; I did not declare an emergency because it was only engine roughness; and although it was the worst engine roughness I've ever heard; and I was fearful that the engine would give out - it hadn't yet and we were still making power. I was prepared to declare an emergency if the situation got any worse; but after the point when I began my turn there was no time to do anything except fly the airplane.I made a left turn into the wind to begin my descent for Runway XY. Losing altitude in the turn; and considering load factor/airspeed; I turned with the minimum radius possible while avoiding a stall/spin situation. The stall horn came on for a moment; and it became clear that we were not going to make the runway. I had a few moments left to consider the remaining options: land on Taxiway 1; or try to clear the GA ramp/Terminal to land in the grass beyond them. The Taxiway was the safest option; considering no other aircraft were occupying it at the time; and Runway XZ-XA is closed. I touched down on Taxiway 1; brought the airplane to a stop; and regathered my thoughts. Tower asked if our engine was still operational; to which I answered yes. I offered apologies to the ZZZ Tower for landing on Taxiway 1; because as mentioned above; I did not have enough time to declare an emergency/update them on my situation once I began the descent to land. I requested to taxi to the GA ramp and shutdown.Final words:If I could have a second chance on dealing with this scenario; I would have done everything exactly the same. As much as I wanted to fly a pattern for Runway X and do a precautionary landing with a headwind; that option did not seem to be on the table. My choices were:Enter a downwind for Runway X and hope we keep the limited performance we have to make it all the way around the pattern; orLand the plane as soon as possible before it turns into a complete power lossI chose the latter and would do it again.
1935714,During pre flight in cockpit the aircraft was felt to lurch and shake. Followed by constant vibrations and another lurch. I witnessed the bag loader from the jet bridge in contact with the plane. Ramp agent said she contacted the plane with the belt loader and then backed off.
1866852,Very short taxi to [Runway] 8L in Ontario so we had discussed and ran before takeoff checklist down to the line before leaving ramp. As we approached 8L I had called Tower and let them know we were ready for departure. If I remember they briefly told us to hold short awaiting IFR clearance and then it was just a couple seconds later she cleared us for takeoff on Runway 8L. The Captain was taxiing the aircraft into position as I was running the before takeoff checklist. As the airplane was just getting aligned with centerline the Captain mentioned he thought there was something on the runway. I was actually looking towards the far end of the runway to see if I could see any type of strobes or lighting as it was night time. It was once we had all the aircraft lights on that we could clearly see a van parked broadsided right on the middle of the runway about 1;000 feet in front of us or so. I had not yet called before takeoff checklist complete or verbally mentioned Runway 8L verified before the Captain had noticed something on the runway. No takeoff power was added or anything like that. I called the Tower to let them know there was a vehicle on the runway and the controller seemed very surprised. The controller cancelled our takeoff clearance and gave us a clearance to line up and wait. Controller then began communicating with FAA ground vehicles to try and get a hold of whomever was on the runway. Controller was unable to contact vehicle on the runway but was able to get a nearby airborne helicopter to hover over the vehicle and use a spotlight and or loud speaker to alert the personnel on the ground. We saw the ground personnel then run over to the vehicle; hop in; and drive off. The tower controller then had another FAA vehicle do a runway inspection the length of the runway and verify that everything was clear of the runway. Once the runway was verified to be clear we were once again cleared for takeoff. We ran the before takeoff checklist below the line again as it had been several minutes since our initial takeoff clearance. We departed ONT without further incident. The controller was very apologetic about the issue. Not sure exactly what happened or where the breakdown was that allowed the vehicle onto the runway without the controller's knowledge. It would have been very very difficult for controller to see the vehicle on the runway from the tower.Some type of breakdown in communication between FAA Ops vehicle/operator and Control Tower. The controller mentioned to us that the vehicle had not been authorized to be on the runway. I believe the operator had been out on the runway changing lights possibly? I do know the vehicle was running though and there was not anybody in the vehicle. Not exactly sure how/why vehicle had gotten out onto the active runway without authorization. Better communication/procedures between Ground Ops/Tower. I also think that if you're going to have vehicles like that on the runway; especially at night; they should be required to have some sort of strobe or beacon light. The vehicle was honestly very hard to see before all of our aircraft lights were on. If the vehicle had been further down the runway; I'm not sure we would have noticed it before we began the takeoff roll.
1933225,After takeoff from Runway XXR at ZZZ; First Officer was flying; he noticed his electric trim was not working. We continued to climb and retract the flaps; to get some altitude to troubleshoot while manually trimming the aircraft. My electric trim refused to work as well. I pulled the checklist for Stab Trim Fail to start working the problem while [the First Officer] controlled the aircraft; and we elected to stop climbing at FL 190. We elected to return to ZZZ; and ATC gave us vectors to return and descend. I alerted Dispatch that we were returning; told the Flight Attendants; and made an announcement over the PA to the Passengers. First Officer continued to fly the aircraft with me assisting with the manual trim; while I got the performance numbers loaded and worked the radios. I briefed the approach to Runway XXR; then took over flying for the final approach and landing. After landing we ran the brake cooling [checklist]; and it indicated that we were good to taxi to the gate.
1917899,Aircraft received landing gear airground fail message on short final. Performed go around; ran QRH; came back to ZZZMaintain vigilance for changing conditions.
1925122,On our go around from [Runway] 19R in Las Vegas we encountered a RA from a departing air carrier. My FO (First Officer) failed to respond in a correct and timely manner so I took control of the aircraft and complied with RA. When I looked outside the window and saw how close the other aircraft was I turned as well to the rear of the plane. I think that the FO did not comply with the RA. Also Tower couldn't give us instructions fast enough to avoid the conflict. Better training.
1891775,During cruise; about an hour after departure; both FMC computers stopped working for about 25 seconds (roughly). The FMC option disappeared from both CDU MENU screens. Both moving maps stopped; all performance data was removed and the autopilot defaulted to CWS roll (as anticipated) when the navigation data became unavailable. We began the process of verify raw data navigation when both FMC computers came back online and proceeded to operate normally. Operationally; we called Operations Control and Maintenance Control and concurred that we were safe to continue. Basic navigation was unaffected and so the safety of flight was not reduced in the event it happened again. However; it does seem to qualify as a serious impact on aircraft systems -- especially since the design redundancy did not work (both sides failed simultaneously). Because the system reset itself normally and did not repeat the fault; it qualified as an INFO-ITEM and the AML entry was made in ZZZ; but the event also appears to qualify as a mandatory report. The description is the same verbiage used in the report. There were no additional factors that indicated the reason that both FMC computers would simultaneous shutdown and then simultaneously restart. No turbulence; we were not interacting with either CDU at the time; nothing. The event is very strange since it caused a breakdown in the 'design through redundancy' principle.Simultaneous failure of redundant systems is a bigger problem than 'an anomaly'. We happened to be in cruise within VOR and VHF range. If this had happened at a more critical time of flight-- where time critical usage of the FMC is greater-- this would have been a larger problem. If this had happened when we were beyond VOR/VHF range; this would have also caused a more serious impact on flight safety. When the FMC computers went offline; we had no access to GPS or IRS navigation data. We also lost all access to FMC performance data. Finding the cause and correcting it appears to be a high priority.
1916103,Early in the boarding process; the B-Flight Attendant came forward a let me know there was a passenger who was cleaning a row of seats with an aerosol spray cleaner. In addition the passenger was verbally difficult when the matter was brought up with her. The Flight Attendant asked for a Customer Service Supervisor. I was able to locate one and requested that she speak with the B-Flight Attendant and the customer to ensure there was not going to be any issues airborne. I was not specific with her about the spray cleaner as I was more concerned that there would be a personality conflict. In addition; throughout this time I was managing two new MELs with Dispatch and Maintenance. Upon completion of that effort; I understood that the issues in back were resolved and we proceeded without incident. Later in the day I asked how the flight had gone with the passenger in question and while they handled the personality clash; no problem we reflected back upon the aerosol issue. It seemed the cleaner was still on the aircraft. I reviewed the FOM and the First Officer reviewed the Company manual. It appeared from that review that the item could have been considered a HAZMAT item that may have been required to be in the checked baggage; vice carry on. What was also noted was [that] there is the HAZMAT Hotline that would have been able to make the proper assessment of the item.
1909769,Air Turn Back. A/C X took off from ZZZ and got engine oil temp alert. Temp went into the red. The Captain followed Quick Reference Handbook and rolled engine back to idle. The temp dropped into Amber. Flight landed back in ZZZ. No request for priority made.
1929726,Practicing power off 180's with Instructor at ZZZ. I did a GUMPS shock midfield; but failed to extend the gear. Once power was set to idle the gear unsafe horn came on; after doing various other power off maneuvers at altitude; my brain ignored the warning horn and I became hyper focused on speed and my landing point. Flew the approach and upon entering into ground effect I noticed something was wrong as the wheels should be touching. I looked down and the horn came back into focus and I caught the error. Immediately added power to initiate a go-around and upon doing so the prop stuck the runway. I was midfield and committed to the go-around at that point and began the climb. I was shaken up so I handed the controls over to my Instructor. The airplane did not indicate any adverse effects; no vibrations and the climb was normal.I have a lot of time in the Arrow and always go a GUMPS check once on downwind and a secondary gear check on final; my failure to comply with my own personal procedure led to this happening. Also I noticed a better glide and that should have been another indication that something was wrong.For the future; I will be sure to continue utilizing a GUMPS check and secondary gear checks as well as adding a third while crossing the threshold and not tuning the gear unsafe horn out. Also I need to be more mindful of becoming hyper complacent in airplanes that I am comfortable with; as well as being impulsive during times of high workloads. For a future abnormal procedure where a landing is aborted in a high stress environment; I need to focus on flying the airplane. I was able to focus to initiate the go around and the climb; but I felt the need to transfer controls after I began to think about what just happened rather than flying the airplane. Lastly; and most importantly I need to be mindful of becoming hyper focused on a few items and be more Thorough with checklist items and keep a good scan going throughout every maneuver.Airplane is grounded and has been reported.
1882701,Aircraft had MEL 34-XX-X and MEL 34-XX-Y. ATL was conducting ILS Runway 26R. I was flying had nav1 signal for LOC 1 with IGXZ on PDF. The LOC became intermittent working and red flag in VMC conditions. Corrected each time but was vectored around for another approach. During this apprise the FO (First Officer) NAV 2 LOC was working. Briefed the changes due to FO will be flying now. When cleared for approach the Flight Director failed and came back. Still VMC and then the FO nav 2 loc 2 went red with red loc flag; which went back to green. Told ATC again there was a problem. Low on fuel we diverted to ZZZ. Discussed with Dispatch. Landed with 1;600 lbs. ATL Approach was very helpful and understanding. Loss of reliability with navigation NAV 1 and NAV 2.
1921391,I was on my break. The purser woke me up and told me that I was needed in the cockpit. I saw that we had offset 5 miles right of course and I was told of the problem. The L ENG OH checklist had been accomplished. When the left throttle was reduced to idle; the L ENG OH message went away. We were between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 on the D track to ZZZ Airport. We [requested priority handling] and received clearance to descend to FL310 and then turn left and proceed directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We made a radio call on XXX.XX stating our position and our planned descent. The L ENG OH checklist came on again on the EICAS. We did the checklist again and this time; when the throttle was reduced to idle; the message did not disappear. We continued the checklist and shut down the left engine. We got clearance to FL200 and we flew directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We communicated with Dispatch; ZZZ Radio; the Flight Attendant's (FA) and made a PA to the passengers. We were given priority vectors to Runway XXR and landed uneventfully.  We taxied clear of the runway and had the Fire Chief look over the plane concentrating on the left engine. We then taxied to Gate XX and shut down.Cause: The L ENG Fire Loop has apparently been replaced 3 sequences prior to our flight. My guess is that it was not completed properly.Suggestions: I don't know how it could have been prevented; but I will say that the training we receive at recurrent is excellent. We performed very well as a team. We discussed things together before executing anything.
1919103,During descent in VMC; the Captain PF (Pilot Flying) asked me; FO (First Officer) PM (Plot Monitoring); to request a VMC descent from Denver Center. Our clearance at the time was to cross the Dunoir DNW VOR at 14;000 ft. I requested the VMC descent from Center. Center asked if we were requesting a Visual Approach and I believe I said yes and they may have said to expect that. Our understanding was that we were cleared to descend VMC. The Captain then began a VMC descent prior to reaching DNW. At approximately 12;700 ft. ATC issued a low altitude alert and told us to climb to 14;000 ft. We told them we were descending VMC to the airport. They asked if we wanted to cancel IFR to which we replied yes. They then said 'IFR cancellation received; squawk VFR; frequency change approved'. We then contacted the JAC Tower; conducted a Visual Approach and landing to Runway 19 with no issues.
1866347,While at Gate XX during heavy wet snow with wind blowing 10-15 kts. 90 degrees from the right side; the APU tripped off line 3 separate times. At some point; we also noticed zero duct pressure. The mechanic found no issues [and] suggested shutting the APU down for several minutes. Upon restart; pressure was normal for approximately 10 minutes; then it started to decrease again. [Contributing factors were] heavy wet snow; [flying] in direct right crosswind; [and] possible issue with design of MAX APU inlet. [I suggest] publishing a note in AOM or somewhere to let crews know this is a possibility on the 737-MAX and have Boeing examine this scenario.
1930163,This was our third leg of the day in Mexico that had numerous immigration issues at all stops. The first leg was a deviation due to thunderstorms over the field and Mexico Approach Control training. We were cleared the Lenul 2A arrival into MMTO. My copilot was on a different frequency verifying we did not have to clear customs now that we were in range and could be heard. Between TO603 and TO604 we were at 15000 [ft.] and the Controller stated 'Cleared direct GAINY descend to 13;000.'  We entered direct GAINY and started the turn and also initiated a descent to 13000. AT 14;200 the Controller asked if we were VMC. We replied no and he told us to climb immediately to 15;000 due to terrain. He then mentioned that we were not cleared to 13;000 until after GAINY.  We climbed to 15;000 and maintained that altitude until he cleared back down to 13;000. Nothing else was mentioned and we were handed off to Tower. Be terrain aware and always double check altitudes if the clearance doesn't make sense. Mexico Controllers phrase clearances and directions slightly different. Take the time to verify instructions.
1870173,We first noticed engine thrust surging during climb through 12;000 ft. The aircraft wasn't climbing at a normal rate. Then through 15;000 ft.; N1 on the number 1 engine was observed to be surging between approx 56% N1 and the climb target N1. We elected to level off at FL 190 to troubleshoot. This was difficult due to the absence of EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System) messages or abnormalities other than the N1 indications. The engine continued surging on and off for roughly 5 minutes between 56% N1 and the cruise target of about 79% before normalizing. A decision to request priority handling was made and along with our Dispatcher we elected to continue to ZZZ. The flight attendants were briefed on the situation. The rest of the flight was normal until initiating the descent at which time the number 1 engine surged again briefly and normalized again throughout the landing roll. Upon rollout ENG 1 NO DISPATCH EICAS message illuminated. The MX logbook entries were made and MX personnel met the aircraft at the Gate. I'll note that 2 MELs were present on the aircraft; ENG 1 short dispatch and engine 1 bleed system.
1900299,Air quality incident.
1876950,First Felt like Left Tire Went Flat. (tire was not Flat). Next nose gear went down. Propeller Hit Ground. plane stopped.
1909164,We received a clearance for a visual approach to [Runway] 35L with direct to the FAF.  I was monitoring our class B floor to ensure compliance and the FO was flying 250 knots. I stepped down his altitude as required to remain in class B. ATC  told us the airspeed was our discretion. As we approached the final marker we were high and fast.  We did not intercept the glide slope at the marker and used vertical speed to continue. At 500 feet we were stable; but I did not get our flaps to 30.  I did not hear a call and we were focused on salvaging the approach. The GPWS said 'terrain' and I thought this was an error. At 50 feet I noticed the flap gauge at 25. Our Vref was 164 knots due to gusts.  Clearly we should have gone around and I offer no excuse.
1898630,Departing APV Runway 18; I left traffic pattern westward in the upwind following Aircraft Y also departing. Immediate west departure was for safety as additional aircraft were attempting left downwind entry of 18 at APV. Nearly immediately after turning west; I received a terrain advisory on a garment 430 NAV. The warning would not clear and I continued to follow departing traffic as I was clear of terrain but between two hills southwest of APV. For safety; I continued to focus on climbing to altitude and departing traffic rather than continue to clear the warning from the 430.I noticed I was in VCV airspace when followed departing traffic began to descend and I looked down to see an aviation boneyard. I immediately turned east to vacate the airspace and began to clear terrain message to obtain VCV Tower frequency. Although; VCV's airspace was not 'busy'; my concern is that the persistent terrain message can make it difficult for pilots to identify Class D airspace and be problematic if airspace is more congested.
1905145,We took off XX in Aircraft X. At about 1200 AGL there was a shutter similar to an ECU swap but more intense. This was accompanied by a power decrease to 63%. The airspeed dropped from 88 to 83. I then took controls; leveled off; and asked ATC to land on XL. I made a tight downwind and base for XL.
1869805,I was conducting an initial Part 141 check for a flight instructor. We requested a Northbound departure and were assigned Runway XXR. Once on a northbound heading we were given a traffic alert from ZZZ Tower for traffic at our 1 o'clock position. We lowered the nose slightly to gain visual.  The traffic passed below us on a Westerly heading. ZZZ Tower informed us the aircraft was with ZZZ1 Approach executing a missed approach from Runway XXR. [The difference in our altitude] was 2;700 ft. MSL [for our flight] and the other aircraft was 2;500 ft. MSL.
1892471,On the ILS XXL approach into ZZZ; I was Pilot Flying and my First Officer was Pilot Monitoring. At approx 2;500 feet in descent we received an EICAS (engine indicating and crew alerting system) Slat Fail. The First Officer also mentioned he had a loud pop. I elected to discontinue the approach and perform a go around. Once leveled off; I transferred flight controls to the PM (FO) and ran the Slat Fail QRH (quick reference handbook). ZZZ gave us delays vectors while running the QRH. There seemed to be confusion between us and ATC. I think they thought we had a flight control malfunction despite stating we had a slat malfunction. They then [assigned priority handling] on their behalf and we gave SOB and FOB. The slats were stuck at 1 but flaps were able to be extended to 5 for landing. After running the QRH; I took back the flight controls to perform the landing. After landing we exited the runway and had the ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting) trucks perform an inspection on the right wing to verify there wasn't any damage to the wing that would prevent taxi back to the gate.
1905852,On departure at FL240; had HYD G RSVR LO LVL ECAM message followed by associated low pressure and other hydraulic messages. Completed ECAM actions and follow ups. Requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ for overweight landing on Runway XXR. Gravity gear extension required. Landed 24;900 pounds overweight. Uneventful landing and cleared the runway. After ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) inspected aircraft; taxied to the gate. There were no causal factors; just mechanical failure. As this incident was caused by mechanical failure; there is nothing I can suggest that would prevent this type of event from occurring in the future. However; it is worth noting that due to good policies; procedures and crew coordination; the event was handled in a superior manner.
1901122,During training flight with instructor. On short final for XXR into ZZZ; 'gear pump on' indicated but 3 green (gear down; not in transit) also shown. Additionally; 'Gear NOT down' auditory message came on when throttles were brought to idle. Performed low approach to determine if gear was down at all - which Tower confirmed was down. During return to final; trouble shot in order to determine any false indications; gear not locked; or other issues. None were found; approach was continued; [priority handling was requested] as precaution for possible faulty landing gear system. Landing performed as normal with no abnormalities except for 'gear NOT down' auditory message sounding.
1896041,I had just received a position relief briefing from the Controller being relieved and was told that Aircraft X was IFR and was going to be executing the published missed approach to KREEN but will want their IFR clearance to JRF. Shortly after taking the position; Aircraft X checked in stating that they were climbing VFR and wanting to pick up their IFR to JRF at 7;000 ft. I then asked the pilot to verify that they were canceling IFR and going to proceed VFR at this time. The pilot responded that they wanted IFR at this time. I then asked the pilot if they were on the published missed approach and the pilot advised that they were flying runway heading at this time. I advised the pilot that you understood that he was assigned the published missed approach procedure to KREEN. The pilot advised they were not issued anything and was just told to contact you on departure. I then pulled up the EOVM map and vectored Aircraft X to a heading of 055 for terrain. Then I went back and told Aircraft X to climb and maintain 4;000 ft. since the missed approach only would climb to 3;000 ft. and I knew I would need Aircraft X at 4;000 ft. to the east of LIH for his IFR. Aircraft X was apparently in the 7;000 ft. MIA when I issued climb and maintain 4;000 ft. Aircraft X was only out of 2;400 ft. and climbing when he reached the 4;000 ft. MIA 50 seconds later. Eventually; I issued Aircraft X their IFR clearance back to JRF once they were mid channel. I don't have any recommendations for this instance.
1870392,On Departure off of Runway 17R in DFW on the AKUNA9 SID; the FO (First Officer) side Radar Altimeter (RA) displayed a flag; and the Captain side RA displayed roughly 200-300 ft. higher than the FO side. This flag was displayed for approximately 5-10 seconds; and then resumed as normal. The first indication of an anomaly occurred around 2;000 ft. MSL; or 1;500 AGL. Possible 5G interference departing DFW. Delay implementation of 5G service until all issues with radar altimeters and transport category aircraft have been dealt with.
1921310,During departure climb through FL230 we experienced a loud bang/pop originating in the nose section of the aircraft immediately followed by a significant increase in volume of air rushing through the cockpit. Notified ATC; stopped the climb at FL280; checked that the aircraft was maintaining cabin altitude/pressurization; it was. Prior to push back we had to have the sensor on the avionics access door deferred per MEL. This coupled with the extremely loud sound of moving air in the cockpit; which was originating in the avionics bay (I opened the floor access door in the cockpit and verified there was no significant movement of air) we determined that the avionics door was still at least partially latched and that a possible door seal failure had occurred. Which was the case. A second pop was experienced with a momentary cabin rate of climb increase to 700 FPM. Contacted Dispatcher; decided to air turn back to ZZZ. Notified Maintenance. Vectored back to ILS [Runway] XX. No emergency declared or crash fire and rescue alerted. Uneventful descent and landing into ZZZ.Cause - Door seal failure; Avionics Access Door.
1869402,Trigger...at FL380 was given descent to FL340. At approximately FL360; the CAB PRESS status page displayed showing a cabin altitude of 9;500 feet and rising. Action requested priority handling with ZZZ ATC; started rapid descent to 10;000 feet; seat belt sign on. First Officer (FO) and pilot flying; performed a maneuver with the autopilot on. ATC gave us initial descent to FL270 and a frequency change. New Controller gave us descent to 10;000 feet with altimeter setting of 29.80. We were in VFR conditions; minimum safe altitude from charts approximately 5;000 feet. FO was able to descend quickly enough that a CABIN ALTITUDE ECAM did not trigger nor did the oxygen masks deploy in the cabin. I was able to speak with FA1; during the descent. FA1 confirmed that passengers were okay and did not report any injuries but would update us if something changed. I made a PA to passengers about aircraft condition and plan of action. Requested all to remain seated until in ZZZ.After level off and confirming aircraft was safe to continue; removed the aircraft alert from ZZZ ATC; but requested priority handling into ZZZ. Sent ACARS message to Dispatch. Stated our problem; action; current situation and plan. Received acknowledgment and new fuel remaining calculation for Denver at 10;000 feet. Highest cabin altitude was 11;350 feet. No ECAMs showed on the upper display. Outflow valve; inlet and extract vents all showed closed. During level off; safety valve opened when cabin diff pressure at -.5 PSI. Remaining flight was uneventful to a landing at ZZZ; XXR. Taxi to Gate at XX. Met by ZZZ maintenance and ZZZ FO representative.
1895477,VFR conditions. I was the PF (Pilot Flying); FO (First Officer) was the PM (Pilot Monitoring). PM had initially set the ILS 36R in the FMC as a back up to the briefed visual approach. Prior to waypoint BOWTZ (the final waypoint on the arrival with a 4000 ft. crossing altitude); ATC gave clearance to descend to 2000 ft. PF selected Level Change; verified with PM and continued descent. Captain (PF) then asked FO to request the RNAV A Approach as a backup for the briefed visual approach. ATC cleared us the RNP Z 36R Approach. RNAV approach was loaded in FMC and briefed as the backup to the visual approach. Prior to the IAF waypoint (BOWTZ); I failed to select/ confirm VNAV; leaving the vertical mode in Level Change. I then set zeros in the MCP altitude window thinking more of a visual approach verses the RNP. At waypoint MYOPE; Tower called a low altitude alert. We were at 1800 ft. MSL with a minimum of 2200 ft. at MYOPE per the approach plate. Vertical deviation was immediately corrected and the approach/landing was continued uneventfully. Weather was clear and we were visual with the field the entire approach. [Automation Management] breakdown with Pilot-to-Pilot communication. There was some initial distractions with Approach Control having difficulty understanding FO's radio transmission saying the radio was scratchy; resulting in a brief discussion between the FO and me on transmission clarity. PM was also distracted with a frequency change that disrupted [Automation Management] as well as the late change to the RNP backup versus the ILS. PF complicated a simple visual approach by task loading the PM with the late ILS to RNP backup. [Automation Management] must be brought to a conclusion despite interruptions and distractions and additive conditions. Minimize the risk by planning and sticking to the plan. I take full responsibility for late changes; task loading and not using [Automation Management] to its entirety.
1899769,We were on the ZZZZZ1 arrival into ZZZ and set up for the ILS Z XXR. After passing ZZZZZ2; we were told to fly present heading and descend and maintain 3000 ft. MSL. As we approached the river; I began to slow to 190 KIAS and asked for Flaps 8 because I felt we were being vectored in close to ZZZZZ3. We asked approach if we could get lower because we were being vectored in between ZZZZZ4 and ZZZZZ3 at 3000 ft. Approach told us to turn to 020; descend and maintain 1800 ft. MSL; cleared for the VISUAL XXR approach. I set 1800 ft. in the altitude select and began my descent while I turned to 020. Because we were cleared for the approach; I activated Approach Mode. The LOC and glideslope (GS) captured immediately on my side. I thought this was strange because we were still intercepting the LOC; and we were above the GS. The aircraft turned to approximately a 050 but did not appear to capture the LOC even though the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) showed captured. The aircraft also began to pitch nose down and began a steep descent. The Captain (CA) announced I needed to get under the GS for it to capture because his side still showed LOC and GS armed; not captured. As I was trying to diagnose the problem; the airspeed began to rise. The CA announced it and deployed the Flight Spoilers to arrest the descent. I tried to use Vertical Speed mode to shallow the descent; but it did not work. At approximately 235 KIAS; the flap over speed clacker was heard. Shortly after; the 'Glideslope' alert was heard then the 'Terrain; Terrain; Pull Up' was heard as the autopilot was disengaged and a go around was initiated. The CA contacted approach; and they told us to turn to 360 and climb to 2000 ft. We were vectored around and tried the approach again; entering from the north. Approach told us to turn to 130 and intercept the XXR LOC. I engaged NAV mode; and the autopilot did not turn in time so we began to fly through the LOC. I engaged Heading Mode and corrected the course. Once on-course; I reengaged NAV mode and the LOC captured successfully. We were cleared for the Visual XXR a second time; and I engaged Approach mode; and it captured the GS successfully. Once on the ground; we contacted maintenance about the flap over speed; and the Autopilot anomalies. Maintenance decided to defer the Autopilot; and we remained on the aircraft for 2 additional legs (ZZZ-ZZZ1 & ZZZ1-ZZZ). On the next leg; we flew the RNAV XY into ZZZ1; but experienced similar LOC and GS issues coming back into ZZZ on XXR. The CA flew ZZZ1-ZZZ and was on the ZZZZZ1 and ILS Z XXR. As we approached the XXR LOC from the south; we noticed the GS indicator was fluctuating almost full scale up and down. He was given a heading to intercept the XXR LOC in between ZZZZZ4 and ZZZZZ3; and with just the Flight Director; the aircraft started to fly through the LOC again. He caught it and flew raw data until on course. Once cleared for the approach; he engaged approach mode and was able to capture the LOC and GS. At first; we thought the gusty winds made it hard for the autopilot to capture the LOC and GS. The winds were 040/14G23 initially and 050/20G27 when we landed. However; when the CA flew his leg back into ZZZ; the winds weren't as bad; and the autopilot wasn't used. There were still large fluctuations in the GS but never any red flags or missing data. The Flight Director was displaying inaccurate data which caused the autopilot to make the wrong inputs. After landing back in ZZZ the second time; the CA called maintenance and decided to upgrade the MEL due to safety of flight. If this same situation had happened in IMC; it would have been much harder to identify as opposed to under VMC. I think the LOC and GS capture was a false capture. Because I devoted too much time trying to diagnose why it was a false capture; I didn't observe the rapid descent. Once I noticed something was wrong; I should have disengaged the Autopilot and hand flown. This would have been safer thanrelying on automation.
1906938,ZZZ ILS Z XXR During ILS Z approach to ZZZ Runway XXR; the G650ER was slightly below GS just after passing DH; inbound to land on Runway XXR. Crew was likely task saturated while practicing a 'simulated' EFVS (Enhance Flight Vision System) approach to TD/Rollout in VMC and may have lost some situational awareness resulting in EGPWS Mode V activation. Crew had recently completed initial EFVS TD/RO simulator training course and annual recurrent training and sought the training benefit/objective of 'real-world' application of newly learned procedures; practice somewhat confusing call-outs; and actual decision making in a live environment; given the opportunity of good weather and somewhat familiar airport. One interesting takeaway is that it is rather confusing to do EFVS simulated procedures in VMC/daylight while simulator training is done in simulated LIFR/night conditions.After aircraft passed DH; and; as PM may correctly recall; on a normal descent profile; the PF became slightly low on GS while referencing HUD 3.0 degree down FPA guidance. PM (self) did not detect the initial GS deviation as he was focusing too much awareness on identification of 'EVS Runway' lighting which takes place at 100' barometric above TDZE. *Note: Runway lights were not illuminated/daytime/VMC.  GPWS Mode V 'Glideslope' audible warning sounded and PF took immediate corrective action. A normal landing followed. Not much thought had been given at the time as there was no perception of hazard by the crew during debrief.  Several other interesting/distracting events (consistent with normal ops in the [metro] area) occurred earlier in the flight including a TCAS TAs during the ZZZZZ. ZZZZZ1 SID and just prior to commencing GS capture on ILS Z XXR. PM recalls delayed automated capture of the ILS Z XXR GS about this same time during the earlier stage of the approach. PM does not recall at this point in time (11 days later); if the A/P was coupled/re-coupled.
1931983,On Day; I was the Second-In-Command on a Part-91 Ferry operation flying a SF-340 from ZZZ to ZZZZ operating on a special flight permit. The aircraft was released for flight by Company X. On the flight; I was the pilot flying and the Pilot-In-Command was the pilot monitoring. METAR was (W) reporting 140/08 10SM; light rain; 700 OVC. I always include in my takeoff briefing should I notice an irregularity; I would call it and let the PIC make the decision for abort or continue. During takeoff at approximately V1; the right engine Torque (TQ) increased to 108%. (Maximum power in the Saab 340B with CTOT-engaged is 100% TQ. CTOT is a device on the aircraft to set desired Torque for takeoff and go-around; Constant Torque on Takeoff. When this occurred I called Right Torque 108%; the Captain said to continue the takeoff and take the aircraft airborne. As soon as we were airborne; the right engine Torque decreased to 40% TQ causing a right yawing moment. (In the Saab 340; if the power lever is pulled back with the CTOT engaged the torque will decrease to approximately 40%). I pushed both power levers forward and grabbed the yoke to maintain directional control. The PIC requested to return to the field and ZZZ Tower gave us left traffic pattern. We leveled out at 3000 ft MSL (around 1500 ft AGL) in IMC and turned the CTOT off. Once the CTOT was switched off the TQ on right engine returned to its previous power setting of 80% TQ (making us believe there was a malfunction with the CTOT). Both Power Levers were then reduced to around 60% TQ. The PIC requested vectors back to land since we were in IMC.We were unable to fly an RNAV approach as the GPS database did not have approaches installed. The PIC requested vectors for the ILS Runway XX in ZZZ. While on vectors to intersect the localizer; both NAV 1 and NAV 2 radios failed and were unable to capture the localizer; glide slope; or VOR/DME. I verified the frequency was correct and approach mode was on. Tower asked our intentions since we overshot the approach course. The PIC requested vectors to an airport with VFR weather. We were given a heading (west) to avoid weather and were transferred to ZZZ Center however; we weren't able to make contact. I tuned in to ZZZ VOR and ZZZ1 VOR to trouble shoot the Nav radios. We received conflicting readings with DME and radials so we confirmed it was a NAV failure and not a station failure. Another aircraft on the same frequency was able to relay messages back and forth for us to ZZZ Center. After climbing to 4;000 ft and out of weather; we were able to speak with Center. The Captain had comms and informed ATC of engine malfunction and lost navigation. Center informed us they had [given us priority] and vectored us south to ZZZ2. I descended the aircraft to 2000 ft to get below the cloud layer and executed a visual approach to Runway XY. I landed the aircraft in ZZZ2 with no further incident.
1906846,I was on my third circuit of the landing pattern for Runway 5 on downwind when Aircraft Y from local flight school says he was entering the pattern on a 45 degree when crossed in front of me descending through my altitude. This is a common occurrence at this airport. All attempts to have a tower installed have failed.
1915468,Performing a #2 service on Aircraft X; found door 2R emergency exit light assembly not installed. Further troubleshooting discovered the area had been panlamed over. Gained access to lower panel of aft galley and found wires dangling. Had to order new lite assembly to install and hook up wiring. Similar to Aircraft Y which had same problem 2 days earlier.
1903140,On taxi in at ZZZ; the number 2 engine flamed out. On approach we got an Auto Fuel Feed Fault ECAM. I elected to continue the approach. We had 6.3 in the Center tank; 1.4 in the Right Inner; and 7.9 in the Outer tank. The flow bar was absent on the right outer and there was no 'OFF' indication on the outer tank isolation valve. The outer tank isolation valve was discovered closed with no OFF indication. This was verified on block in. We shut down the other engine as we were on the ramp and I had us towed into the gate. Auto Fuel Feed Fault coupled with Rt Outer Isolation Valve closed with no 'OFF' warning. Be more vigilant with respect to fuel system.
1878386,Hour and a half out of ZZZ get an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) that comes and immediately goes away. What was that? Then it came back for a little longer: HYD G RSVR LO LVL. And quickly goes away. HYD system page shows low green quantity; just above the amber range. ECAM comes back and stays on. Run ECAM actions; QRH; discuss our understanding together; talk with Dispatch and MX (Maintenance) Control; inform ATC of situation; requesting special handing by ZZZ Tower due to no nose wheel steering after landing; brief inflight and customers. Inflight code yellow; as normal landing expected; except for stopping on runway; and tug to gate. Landed uneventfully on Runway XXL. Super tug to gate; ZZZ MX noted large amounts of hydraulic fluid in gear bay.
1882701,Aircraft had MEL 34-XX-X and MEL 34-XX-Y. ATL was conducting ILS Runway 26R. I was flying had nav1 signal for LOC 1 with IGXZ on PDF. The LOC became intermittent working and red flag in VMC conditions. Corrected each time but was vectored around for another approach. During this apprise the FO (First Officer) NAV 2 LOC was working. Briefed the changes due to FO will be flying now. When cleared for approach the Flight Director failed and came back. Still VMC and then the FO nav 2 loc 2 went red with red loc flag; which went back to green. Told ATC again there was a problem. Low on fuel we diverted to ZZZ. Discussed with Dispatch. Landed with 1;600 lbs. ATL Approach was very helpful and understanding. Loss of reliability with navigation NAV 1 and NAV 2.
1921210,Moderate wake turbulence event during second segment climb beginning at 1200 ft. AGL. Followed B757 on takeoff. Had three separate roll events of 30 degrees to both the left and right. Two minute takeoff separation for following B757 should be re-instituted.
1898596,My student and I announced our takeoff; crosswind; and our downwind for the runway at an uncontrolled field. There was one plane short final for the runway. A Luscombe announced one mile out crossing midfield. I then asked if they were planning on going behind us as we were already on downwind. They said traffic no factor; possibly confusing us with the aircraft landing. I then told them they were headed right at us as they were crossing mid field. They then said they do not have us in sight. We were right in front of them and lower than them as they approached the traffic pattern almost t-boning us. I asked him if he was planning on slowing down and getting space between us as we were ahead and lower than him. He still said he did not have us in sight. He continued to fly right on top and slightly behind us even as I told him we were turning base and he should extend downwind to create that spacing. He was careless; not paying attention to radio calls; and very complacent with not searching for traffic even though we were right in front of him if he would've just looked. After looking up the pilot on the FAA website; his last medical was [many years ago] and does not have basic med.
1874185,After takeoff from ZZZ; the FA's (Flight Attendant) reported a chemical/exhaust smell and a brief period of a haze in the cabin. Both of the items soon disappeared; but we were able to briefly smell a exhaust type smell briefly in the cockpit as well. As we started the descent into ZZZ1 and the power levers retarded to idle thrust; the odor returned and was reported by the rear FA's but without a haze report this time. The odor was faintly noticeable in the cockpit and would dissipate quickly once the power levels were returned to a greater than idle power setting. After landing and upon gate arrival; I consulted with the FA's and decided the aircraft was to be written up for a smoke/odor/fume event. The FA's met with their respective Flight Service managers and were evaluated by EMT's at the airport. The EMT's instructed the FA's to seek further medical attention. At that point; the FA's left the airport for the hospital to be further evaluated. The FO (First Officer) and I decided that we did not need medical attention. Our aircraft was taken out of service and eventually cancelled due to lack of cabin crew.The aircraft had been sitting in ZZZ for 24 hours with constant rain. My guess is certain areas that get hot following application of bleed air may have steamed off latent oil and/or other fluids that may have been ingested into the packs.[I suggest] more aircraft maintenance that revolves around preventative care of the aircraft.
1875781,On approach into LAX at 2;500 feet we had a near mid air with a large yellow drone. It passed just below and left of the nose/wing. We notified ATC and landed normally. Post flight inspection by both pilots and maintenance showed no impact.
1890242,Aircraft Y was shooting a practice VOR-A approach into AUO under VFR conditions. Weather was clear; no ceiling; visibility unrestricted; light winds and no turbulence. Aircraft Y called he was crossing midfield to enter left downwind for Runway 18 at AUO. Aircraft X was departing Runway 18 at AUO. Instead of crossing midfield at the prescribed 500 ft. above Traffic Pattern Altitude; crossed midfield at 500 ft. below Traffic Pattern Altitude. Aircraft X was forced to stop climb as evasive action to avoid a collision with Aircraft Y. ADS-B data reported a vertical separation of less than 300 ft. as the airplanes crossed each other's paths over midfield.
1877527,New Hire Student First Officer on initial operating experience has bounced landing due to lack of feel of aircraft approaching ground during the landing phase of flight. On go-around; the student applied max thrust and relaxed back stick pressure causing the aircraft to point at the ground requiring Instructor to take controls to avoid ground impact and execute go-around procedure. Student inability to identify aircraft closure rate with ground to start aircraft flare on time; resulting in bounced landing. Instructor Response; have a training event that focuses specifically on balked landings and go-around during simulator training for First Officers prior to releasing students to the line for initial operating experience. Implement a policy for initial operating experience students to return to simulator for specific landing practice if not on track to complete initial operating experience by the 50 hour point due to deficiencies in landing the aircraft.
1879052,During initial climb; passing about 8000 feet an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) Cargo Smoke Warning occurred; but then quickly stopped and went away. However; the last page; only; of the ECAM Actions for cargo smoke was displayed on the STS (Status) page. Moments later; passing through about 10000 feet the same warning recurred and again stopped and vanished. The STS continued to display the same last page.Since we [were] coasting-out and were unable to determine whether or not we were on fire; and unable to determine if the warning was for the for the forward or aft cargo compartment; I transferred aircraft control and ATC communications responsibilities to the First Officer; with the command to request priority handling and return to the departure airport ASAP.We each completed our divided duties and re-joined as a crew; so to speak; on about a 10 mile final. Although we were about 21;000 pounds above maximum landing weight; First Officer rolled the aircraft onto the runway as smooth as could be and brought us to a stop on the center line. I found the procedure of calling 'My Aircraft' and the onset of both warnings very helpful. And the method of dividing responsibilities; i.e.; 'Your aircraft; your radios' to serve us perfectly as well.
1909840,Broken Stab R2 brake assembly removed and stowed in flight deck. Please review MEL XX-XX-X and XX-XX-X. The stabilizer has two EMCU (Electric Motor Control Unit) units L2 and R2. Their inputs are single path summed inputs to the HTAS (Horizontal Trimmable Stabilizer System) (Company name for the jack screw that moves the horizontal stabilizer). This MEL allows one of the two to be inoperable (and requires the entire EMCU and brake assembly to be removed); and for the plane to fly 10 flights before being fixed with no restrictions (such as no ETOPS; etc). In the last several years a high proportion of fatal aviation crashes have involved broken stabilizers or jack screws. A single failure of the remaining control unit (but breaking in a different way than unanticipated by Boeing) could create a very difficult to control airplane. The backup for the remaining stabilizer control unit is the elevators to provide pitch control--but they could be fighting against a non-faired stabilizer and CG both moving in the same direction against them. Issues with MEL: 1. Only a single failure of the other EMCU stabilizer motor control brake unit could create a priority situation. While the elevators could still control pitch; the non normal checklist for stabilizer requires a flaps 20 landing because elevators alone may be insufficient to overcome an out of position stabilizer. An example of this scenario is where the plane is loaded with an aft CG requiring nose down trim on the nose down limit for takeoff (what we had) and the stabilizer assembly breaks on transition from climb to cruise and locks in the climb attitude. You would have two strong forces pitching the nose up and the smaller elevator surfaces to bring it down again. Additionally this stabilizer position would create parasitic drag and increase fuel burn.2. Unlike other parts on the plane (for example the center fuel pumps; each of which can fully fuel both engines); the stabilizer control units are each designed for only half the load/work of moving the horizontal stabilizer. This is called single path summed inputs design. This is evidenced by the fact the trim rate drops to half with the MEL. When you remove a part of system and leave the remaining parts under a heavier than normal strain they are likely to break earlier and different than they otherwise might have. For connected systems the failure of one component can often cause damage to any attached system elements because as one brake assembly is breaking it is putting greater than normal load and strain on the remaining unit and everything else attached to it. The fact that this MEL could allow 100 hours plus of flight time on the remaining stabilizer assembly is increasing the chance that it breaks. Any wear statistics on the stabilizer assemblies are based on both working in concert each taking half the load. Does Boeing really have failure data on a single assembly? Especially flown over 100 hours; and after the other one was breaking first?3. Dispatch over ETOPS compounds the problems a single failure could create. Parasitic drag of the stabilizer could increase fuel burn. Alternates are far away.4. The EMCU R2 was removed and placed in the flight deck and not tied down. So created a hazard for the pilots.
1882861,During our approach into ZZZ; we where given the RNAV GPS XX; using high LPV minimums. During the brief we added in a 2 mile fix around the FAF to give us visual awareness for the 'GPS APPROACH' callout. Our initial ATIS information we received called for 10 miles of visibility; high winds and a ceiling of 6500 ft. As we descended through the STAR and vectors to the GPS approach; weather was rapidly deteriorating. On final approach we descended down to 1700 ft. and the next altitude was of 800 ft. was set. Once approaching the 2 mile point the GPS approach was called and I started a vertical descent of 700 fpm mistaking it for the 0.2NM descent. With Windshear and poor visibility; I was focused on maintain proper airspeed to ensure no over speed occurred. The Captain was making sure we had forward visibility and when he glanced back into the cockpit he noticed we were below the snowflake. At the time we were approaching 1100 ft. and ATC made an altitude alert call. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and rejoined the snowflake and continued down on a 700 fpm descent following the guidance.No contact of the runway environment was made and a go-around was initiated. On the go-around ATC noted that multiple aircraft have gone around at this point. During this time a new ATIS had come out with a visibility of 1 1/2SM. We didn't realize this until after making it on the ground. ATC was giving weather updates stating that improving visibility was from the viewpoint of the Tower but no actual visibility was stated as well as ceiling updates. We went around and made a second attempt using the GPS XX approach and made contact with the runway environment and landed. With the favorable weather conditions upon the original ATIS information; we had an expectation bias that the weather was going to be good upon landing. Poor visibility due to dropping weather conditions and high winds caused a high workload environment. We set up a 2 mile fix around the FAF; ZZZZZ; to remind us to call out 'GPS APPROACH' callout. I mistakenly mistook the 2 mile distance from the FAF for the 0.2 mile distance to initiate the descent. With both the CA (Captain) and I in a high workload situation in poor weather conditions; the callout for 'VS' was unchecked even though the confirmation of 'VS' was made. The distraction wind shear and monitoring the airspeed caused me to not fully check the distance correctly from the FAF. This brought the aircraft to descend too early and caused the low altitude callout from ATC. Another error of the cause was a lack of experience on my part; this was my second GPS approach in a real aircraft in weather conditions. A go-around should have been made instead of continuing the approach even though forward visibility was there when we received the Low Altitude Alert. Had we known the visibility an approach into ZZZ1 would have been more reasonable. Even though the checklist for the GPS approach was briefed; it probably would have been good to go over it again once closer to the airport to ensure all callouts and actions are properly made. An ILS approach would have given us more visual awareness and a reduced workload. Checking the automatic ATIS update prior to making the second attempt. Another suggestion would be to review familiarize myself with GPS approaches more so since I have only done two at this point.
1910841,When the flight crew arrived at the aircraft; it had been towed from the maintenance hangar sometime in the middle of the night before our departure. During preflight; the Captain noticed the Gear Pins were missing from the cockpit and the FO reported after his preflight walk around that they were still installed in the Landing Gear. The AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) showed that the Gear Pins had been removed and stowed the night prior by employee NUMBER. The Captain contacted OPS on the radio ad well as Maintenance Control by telephone; and entered the discrepancy in the AML . The local ZZZ OPS sent a newly hired ramper who immediately removed the three gear pins; and rushed them to the cockpit. The ramp agent did not know where they belonged in the cockpit or how to store them. He was also not trained or authorized to make any entries in the AML. The CA discussed the issue with the ramp agent; an operations agent; and the Maintenance Representative who later arrived at the airplane. All three stated that there is an ongoing issue at ZZZ where ramp teams tow aircraft from the maintenance hangar to the gates in the morning with zero representation from the maintenance team.These ramp tow teams have been performing unauthorized maintenance on the aircraft by installing and removing gear pins without properly logging such activities in the AML. The Ramp agent and Maintenance agent expressed that this was at least the third instance of an aircraft being released to a flight crew with installed Gear Pins (and no AML logging) in the last week. Maintenance verified the Gear Pins were properly removed and stowed; and then signed off the AML while the FO performed a new preflight walk-around inspection. Ramp Agents are performing unscheduled and undocumented Gear Pin installations on aircraft. This greatly and significantly increases the chances of an aircraft launching with the Gear Pins installed. The 'Swiss cheese holes' are lining up! Immediately stop the ZZZ ramp crews from towing aircraft without properly documenting when they have installed the Gear Pins. Provide training to all ZZZ operations managers and ramp agents on the importance of proper procedures; AML logging; and the dangers of an aircraft launching with Gear Pins installed.
1896666,Electrical problem whereby entire avionics system and engine lost power temporarily; then intermittently until landing. Headed straight in to ZZZ. Configured aircraft for best glide. Initial thoughts were battery/alternator problems (Have 2 Alternators and 2 Batteries); but avionics were in the process of rebooting so could not observe Voltage/Amperage at first. Avionics rebooted; and began emergency procedures: Battery Voltages Green; Alternators producing voltage/amperage; all Circuit breakers in; switched to ECU 2 (backup ECU) and Fuel Pump 2; switch fuel tanks. Radios came up; called into ZZZ Unicom and advised local traffic that I was having problems and coming in on a right base for Runway XX. Noticed there was power lines running across my path to Runway XX; observed to ensure clearance. Resumed diagnosis; and deduced might be the Electronic Bus Mgr. upon which time engaged the Emergency Bus Bypass switch which routes direct power to the Buses. Reached over and Pulled RPM control (Prop pitch) back to reduce drag and began slight turn to line up with Runway XX once Power Lines were cleared. At 300 ft. AGL; had runway made and continued reduced power descent. Dropped landing gear; received Green Light on Nose; but not Mains. Was now at about 50 ft. AGL and just about to cross threshold. Pumped emergency gear pump a couple of times and noticed the Emergency Bus Bypass switch was back in the off position. Quickly flipped it on again and dropped full flaps. Engine began to come alive again and thought for a moment that I should do a go around and work on gear; but decided that I had runway made and wasn't sure that problem was totally fixed. Decided continued landing was smartest/safest bet.Touched down at 65 kts.; soft landing; but Mains had not locked out and retracted back into wells. Nose Gear remained down and aircraft settled on rear tie down skid under tail. Shut engine down to avoid prop strike if Nose Gear happened to give way. Continued down runway with no braking (brakes are on Mains) and limited rudder authority. As aircraft slowed to about 20 kts.; lost rudder authority and aircraft slowly veered to left side of Runway XX and came to full stop about 25 ft. in soft turf at which point the nose gear retracted and aircraft sat down on belly.Damage incurred:Minor repairable abrasions on belly and Tail skid section.Nose Gear Hydraulic Cylinder brokeOne of Three prop blades damaged when nose gear retracted at stop; unrepairable remaining blades and hub no damage.Time from Occurrence to landing = 3 mins
1921319,We had a PACK INOP on take off out of ZZZ on Aircraft X. We transferred the bleeds from the APU to the engines when we got a Left PACK High Press Caution Message. We ran the QRH at 3;000 ft. and the Caution Message continued. We then proceeded to the unpressurized flight QRH and completed that. At that time cabin temp was 32 Degrees C; and we were close to reserve fuel landing in ZZZ1. We deemed the safest option was to go back to ZZZ. Cause: Complex single pack operations. QRH was vague in stating that if the High pressure caution message continues that the Pilot should then proceed to the unpressurized flight QRH.
1935688,We took off Runway XX out of ZZZ. I was the Pilot Flying (PF). Climbing out of 7;000 ft. we experienced a loud bang; accompanied by severe shaking and vibrations. After a second bang; I looked at the engine indications and saw the right engine was surging severely. I suspected a compressor stall.  I immediately shallowed our climb; pulled the thrust lever to idle and the compressor stall went away with normal engine indications at idle. The Captain (CA) initiated a request for priority handling with ZZZ Approach; and we leveled off at 8;000 ft. We ran the ECAM procedure and pulled out the QRH for Engine Stall. We ran it and tried several times advancing the thrust lever; and the compressor stall returned every time. We left the thrust lever at idle; ran the single-engine approach procedures and told ATC we were diverting to ZZZ2. I continued being the PF and flew the ILS to [Runway] YYR. The landing was uneventful; and we exited the runway. As we began exiting the runway the engine auto-shutdown and displayed an Engine Stall ECAM. I transferred control to the Captain; ran the ECAM procedure; and we came to a stop. Airport Rescue & Firefighting checked over the aircraft and the right engine and saw no abnormal indications. We taxied to Gate XXX and disembarked the passengers as normal.No factors played a role in this from the flight crew. All indications and procedures were normal up to this point.No suggestions; this was a mechanical issue.
1899756,We were on X country dual time building flight ZZZ to ZZZ1. During preflight we noticed oil level was very low around 1 quartz; so we added 6 quarts during preflight. After ground check was normal; we taxied to Runway XX. When holding; the alternator amps where at zero; volts where at 23; and battery amps where at zero; even when alternator where turn off the battery amps went negative (troubleshoot was unsuccessful). Also; oil temperature indicated 235 Fahrenheit (almost touching the red range). We requested Tower to taxi back to ramp. While taxing back we also experienced issues with hand brake. After returning safely to ramp; airplane was squawked for all the issues noted.
1909109,I had experienced an alternator failure enroute from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and made a precautionary landing at ZZZ2. A local retired A&P assisted in checking the airplane and removing the battery. I had called my local A&P and he flew a C-210 and brought a 24 volt charger and charged the battery. It was expected the battery would have enough charge to make sure that I had lights to land. I took off; with my passenger; a private pilot. We wanted to get as much daylight as possible. We had agreed prior that I would fly at 2;500 ft. and the C-210 would fly at 3;000 ft. The A&P was to call the tower; explain the situation and be on the lookout for me and then follow. While I was flying; the private pilot was trying to contact tower via text and voice messages. About 15 miles out; I activated every light that I had. All along; both the private pilot and myself were monitoring our individual Foreflights on tablets and phones to look out for traffic. As we were approaching ZZZ1; I check the favored runway. I saw both [Runway] XX and YY were indicating 2kt; but XX was favored. It was my plan to enter a 45 for a right downwind to obtain a light gun. As I was monitoring Foreflight; I noticed traffic taking off on YY. At that time; I made the decision to turn wide and enter a left downwind for YY for a light gun. Not receiving any; not observing any traffic; I landed. As I am on short final; I notice that I have a landing light; and flashing strobes reflecting off the ground. As I taxied to the hangars; I noticed that my A&P were landing on [Runway] XX. After I shut down; I called the tower on my cell phone. I explained to the controller what I have shared here. While talking with him; a fireman wanted to obtain my info. The tower controller said; 'I just popped up' when he saw me land. He suggested we could have filed a flight of two; or returned the next morning and that he had 10 minutes before closing to file his report.
1919011,Approach to ZZZ last minute changed from Runway XX to the ZZZZZ Visual to Runway XYR. A vector heading was given to join a left downwind with the terrain and the airport in visual contact at all times VMC conditions. On joining the downwind while descending and configuring for landing with the terrain clearly visible off the right of the aircraft a caution alert 'terrain /terrain' was annunciated. This was a momentary alert as the rising ridge on the downwind was well off the horizontal plane of the aircraft and was cleared in seconds. More vigilance should have been given to closure rate while descending in this environment so as not to activate mode 2 GPWS.
1868292,While enroute ZZZ-ZZZ1 our center hydraulic quantity started decreasing. While reviewing the appropriate non-normal checklists in [App]; the application crashed twice. We had to close and restart it each time; which resulted in a loss of all open tabs. Essentially we had to start the checklists over from the beginning.This happens frequently (like once or twice per trip). [App] just freezes sometimes -- it doesn't matter whether you're connected to the internet or not.Flight Operations wants to remove paper QRH's from the airplanes. This absolutely cannot be allowed to happen until we have a replacement system that works 100% of the time.
1909382,I landed Runway XX in ZZZ during VMC conditions and exited the runway on A4. At that point; contacted ground and received clearance to taxi to parking (foxtrot) via alpha; cross XX. My student and I were taxing on alpha and wanted to double check to make sure we were cleared to cross Runway XX. Ground then confirmed we were cleared to cross Runway XX. We continued to taxi. As we approached Runway XX; my student and I proceeded to visually check Runway XX for traffic as a precaution. To the right; we saw an aircraft taking off Runway XX. Had we not held short of Runway XX at that time or checked late; there could have been a collision on the runway. Thankfully we held short. At that point I called tower and stated we were holding short of Runway XX for the plane that just took off. Tower then cleared us to cross XX for the 3rd time and apologized.
1868126,After clearing the Runway 36L at AUS on Taxiway G; Ground Control issued us taxi instructions:  'G; C; West Ramp on C.  The First Officer then went off frequency to call Operations. Just before reaching taxiway C; I looked to my left in the direction of the upcoming turn and saw a Aircraft Y; moving southbound on C at about 30-40 knots. I had to slam on my brakes in order to avoid a collision. I then made a snarky remark to the Ground Controller that a head's up about Aircraft Y jet would have been appreciated. He apologized and said something to us to indicate that he had been distracted by ramp traffic and airplanes waiting to get to gates. This could have been a catastrophic collision had I not been glancing to my left.  Recommend a dedicated ramp controller that deals with ramp traffic thereby allowing the Ground Controller to monitor and control the movement area.Ground Control distracted with ramp congestion and never told us about other aircraft.Suggest a dedicated Ramp Control frequency and Controller.
1892421,On DATE; crew scheduling contacted me requesting that I fly Aircraft X that evening due to crew fatigue. The previous crew had experienced a series of mechanical problems throughout the day; and I was to be the relief captain. Knowing this; I arrived at the gate approximately 15-20 minutes before scheduled show time to determine the status of the aircraft; and how repairs were proceeding. Mechanics were working on repairing the hydraulic systems on Aircraft X after a complete hydraulic failure earlier that day. Aircraft X was also being looked at for a pressurization issue. Maintenance believed the hydraulic issue was a simpler problem that could be resolved more expeditiously to minimize potential delay; and they told me it would take 45-60 minutes to complete. When I was notified that the repairs were completed; I returned to the aircraft with the First Officer; and I told him to coordinate with the ramp crew so that I could taxi Aircraft X from the auxiliary parking space to [gate]. I ensured that the hydraulic system was producing pressure via the hydraulic pressure gauge and the lack of annunciation on the annunciator panel. The nose wheel steering system (NWS) was not operating when I attempted to turn out of the parking space; so I shut down and NAME came over to the plane. After various tests and checks to determine the cause of inoperative NWS; and coordinating with NAME1 and NAME2; we determined that it would be best to defer maintenance on the NWS per the MEL procedure; and continue the flight without it. From this point; everything seemed to be returning to normal. I taxied Aircraft X to [gate]; the First Officer and I prepared it for passengers; and we boarded after being fueled. Engine start; taxi; pre-takeoff checks were all normal. During takeoff; after standard call outs; at approximately 100-102 KIAS; prior to our V1/Rotate speed of 106 KIAS; I noticed the taxi light located on the nose gear strut turn off; and the nose subsequently fell to the ground. I immediately and continuously held full aft yoke pressure to shift as much weight to the main gear struts as possible. The First Officer immediately requested priority handling and assisted me with holding the yoke aft. I then pulled both Stop and Feather controls simultaneously; and focused all of my effort to keep the plane on the runway center line using rudder only. I did not use any brakes. During this time I also clarified the nature of the situation with Tower; and requested priority vehicles to meet the plane. After rolling/sliding for approximately 10;000 feet; the First Officer and I looked out the flight deck windows to ensure that there was not a fire; and I asked the Tower if he could see any flames coming from our aircraft.When he answered in the negative. Leaving all exterior lights on; I instructed the First Officer to open the main cabin door; assist the passengers out of the aircraft; and take them to the grass on the East side of the runway. I made an announcement over the PA that we were deplaning; to follow the direction of the First Officer; and exit the plane via the main cabin door. I informed the Tower of all of these things; then assisted the remaining passengers out of the airplane. After ensuring everyone was unharmed; I returned to the aircraft to inform the tower that I was shutting down all remaining systems. I coordinated with company; emergency crews; and airport operations to manage the situation; and only returned to the aircraft a few minutes later to retrieve my jacket. There was an extremely simple step that could have prevented several of these issues along the way: thoroughly; diligently utilizing the acceptance/pre-flight checklist located in the aircraft to ensure the correct configuration of the flight deck. This was not done; and the pre-flight was accomplished by memory; without checklist verification or utilization. Because of this; the Gear Position Control lever was in the UP position throughout this entire chain of events; and was never corrected. It is almost certain to be the cause of the NWS issue; as well as the emergency on the runway. I can't speak for any other pilot; but I can say with absolute confidence that this critical step will never be missed by me again.
1888435,Staffing numbers for the evening shift were four below the number; eight out of twelve; plus one Controller in Charge for the entire shift. Supervisor for the morning/day shift called me at XA:00L asking if I could come in for two hours of overtime at the beginning of the shift since the night shift had taken sick hits. I was originally scheduled to be in at XF:00L and agreed to come in at XD:00L. The other person scheduled for a XF:00 shift also came in at XD:00 for two hours of overtime. The day shift had also taken sick hits and was below the number. Nine out of twelve. One person changed their shift from XD:00L to XZ:00L and was held over one hour at the end of their shift for coverage. Two certified D-Sides from the morning shift were held over two hours. There was one Controller in Charge for the entire night shift starting at XD:30LThe warning areas along the east coast were all active. Within fifteen minutes of working Sector 50; every sector in the area had a D-Side staffing; except Sector 25 (Low sector). On a normal day. D-Sides are not staffing unless it is for training or currency time. During the position relief briefing; I was told that coordination sector to sector had occurred for AR (Atlantic Routes) traffic; single flow over CARPX intersection (190 miles offshore) due to weather and a rocket launch. If aircraft were not offshore capable; then there were to be routed inland; down J121. This coordination had been started early during the day shift; but no official routing was on the status board. Surrounding areas had been told about it. Northern sectors were not participating with the reroutes and aircraft were departing with normal AR routing. There was thirty miles in trail for PBI; MIA; and FLL for aircraft filed down J121 (inland). I had been working roughly ten minutes when the daytime Supervisor came into the area and announced the ZJX inland sectors (J47/J48) had shut off southbound traffic and to expect the same call to my area's south sectors (09/35). About five minutes later; ZJZ sectors J48 and J47 shut off southbound traffic and told to hold. Sector 09 exhausted holding fixes and altitudes available to them with warning area still after. They coordinated the last plane they could take with me at Sector 50. My sector quickly exhausted available holding fixes and altitudes; again with warning areas active to the east. I coordinated with the sector to the northeast side; how many planes I could take from them and hold any other Florida traffic. Sector 34 (sector below mine) shut off daily departures from another sector to the north and told to hold any Florida traffic. Sector 09 shut off northbound traffic from ZJX after roughly twenty to thirty minutes due to holding stacks using every altitude. Any aircraft within sector 09 northbound were vectored to avoid the holding stacks.; which would be coming into my sector and had to be vectored around my holding stacks as well. Any aircraft not going to Florida; either southbound or westbound; also had to be vectored around holding stacks in my sector. After about forty to forty-five minutes later; ZJX started taking southbound traffic; thirty miles in trail per airport. By this time; some aircraft I had been holding requested to divert to nearby airports (RDU or CHS). These required lengthy vectoring to get them lower. Warning areas (W122 and W386) went cold/inactive to accommodate holding for the sectors they were in. W122 is in Sector 09; and W386 is in the sector north of the one I was working; Sector 39. This happened about the time I was being relieved from the sector. AR traffic could still be routed single flow over the CARPX fix if they were able. I was relieved from the sector at about XE:05L. I took a thirty minute break and when I returned; I relieved the controller at Sector 09. There was no longer holding; there was still thirty miles in trail for inland (J121) traffic; very low volume and D-Sides had been released from positions.Earlier in the day; ZJX had shut off ZTL southbound traffic; which in turn; ZTL had shut off the western areas of ZDC. The event that occurred on the east coast could have been avoided. Communication between the Command Center; TMU; and the Centers needs to improve. Although sector to sector coordination is a valuable tool for Controllers; it should not have to be used throughout an entirety of a day; when there is an ongoing issue with the NAS. This event was a complete breakdown in communication when feasible plans could have been put in place to help the centers being inundated with traffic who have weather or low staffing. (Ground stops; SWAP routing; etc.)
1877028,Plane had an air return the day before for nose gear noise on takeoff. We briefed and anticipated an issue. Normal takeoff just prior to 4000 ft. initial level off a thumping sound started followed later by a LGICU (Landing Gear Control Interface Unit) 2 FAIL ECAM. We leveled at 10;000 ft. and coordinated with Maintenance and Dispatch who all agreed we needed to return to ZZZ. We had burned below Max landing weight while coordinating so we returned for a normal landing. Tower did decide to [assign priority handling] for us. Upon landing we had an over wing exit show open. That turned out to be just the cover came off (another repeat from the day prior). PA to remain seated and coordinated with Flight Attendants that the exit was closed. Taxied to the Gate and swapped planes to go to ZZZ1.
1893168,Shortly after takeoff out of ZZZ airport we got an auto press caution message at around 3;500 ft. We elected to level off at 5000 ft. and get vectors away from the storms. I was Pilot Flying. I took controls and radios and asked my First Officer to pull out the Quick Reference Checklist and Quick Reference Handbook for Auto Press Caution message. We completed the checklists. Advised Dispatch; ATC; and Flight Attendants. I received reports of ear discomfort from the Flight Attendants.I noted we had passengers onboard who were susceptible to medical issues from potential extraneous ear pressure; i.e. babies and older passengers. We elected to return to the airfield in the interest of safety. Other contributing factors I had in mind were storms; high cruising altitude; high task saturation; and the increase of risk factor of potential further issues/emergencies/failures that could arise in flight on top of the already highly task saturated duty of manual pressurization and deviations of storms.Auto pressurization failure; inner ear pressure issues potentially causing damage. Task saturation. If anything else were to occur during flight on top of having to dedicate duties away from flying to control the pressurization manually then it would increase risk factor and degrade pilot attentiveness and safety of flight further.
1903585,Uneventful Qual Line Check flight to ZZZ from ZZZ1. After the passengers had deplaned; our Flight Attendant (FA) cabin jump seater entered the flight deck and informed the pilots that doors 1L and 1R had incorrect placards installed. Specifically; the placards with the word 'OPEN' and the illustration on how to open the main cabin door in a priority situation. The placards for the 'Left' doors are mirror images of the placards for the 'Right' doors. The difference being the orientation of the diagram. She explained that she had found this discrepancy on 'at least 10' aircraft; that it was a 'no-go item' and that we should write it up once we were inbound to ZZZ1; since cabin inspectors would be looking for this issue. I thanked her for bringing this to our attention; and explained the requirement to write up any known discrepancies or irregularities as soon as they were known. We contacted Maintenance and described the issue; and they dispatched a contract mechanic; who did a fantastic job deferring the issue. They printed facsimile placards and fastened them in place; resulting in minimal delays. I bring this to the attention for several reasons. This aircraft as obviously operated numerous flight segments with improper placards installed.  I recommend reaching out to Maintenance to see if a fleet directive or other inspection program should be initiated to check for similar errors. Should consider reaching out to the safety team in case there are mechanics who should file reports for the incorrect placard installation. Should consider reaching out so that the jump seating Flight Attendant can submit a report with her perspective on the event. What is most troubling for me is that she likely noticed this issue during boarding in ZZZ1; as she was one of the first people on the aircraft and had notified numerous crews of this issue yet she chose to wait until her commuter flight arrived in ZZZ to notify the crew of the discrepancy. This act indicates that our Inflight Services partners might need to re-emphasize the importance of notifying the flight deck as soon as they find a defect or discrepancy with the aircraft.
1867680,"I was flying in the pattern doing takeoff and landing practice. It was extremely crowded with many airplanes in the pattern. I was on the downwind getting close to turning base to Runway 31. That circuit is a right pattern. I was probably alerted by TCAS; but I looked at my display and saw an aircraft close to me and below on my left side. I looked out the window and there was another airplane passing below me from my left to my right. I then saw it about 200 or 300 ft. below me on my right side. At that moment the Tower Controller asked if I saw the airplane on my right. I responded with yes"" and then I said that ""I just flew over him."" I then proceeded to turn base and subsequently land. At that time; I was surprised that the controller didn't warn me about the airplane; but I continued my day without thinking much about it.This evening I was reflecting on what happened and realized that the incident could have been my fault. I don't recall the Tower saying to follow another airplane before landing. If so; then I should have kept that airplane in sight. As I am thinking now; if that was the case; maybe the other airplane was in the downwind leg as normal or possibly rather wide. Then; maybe I continued in the downwind pattern moving closer to the runway than the other airplane; which would put me to the right of it. It then turned to base and passed below me. By the time I saw it; it was too close for me to take any evasive action; even if I thought it was necessary.It may have been lucky that I was about 250 ft. above the published pattern altitude and the other airplane was either at pattern altitude or lower; giving us a wide margin. Had that not been the case it could have been a near miss or worse."""
1884557,After pushing back; start; and initial taxi on the ramp; we had not received final weights. Using radio 2; I called operations to get a status on the weights. I was also using radio 2 for CTAF advisories. After getting the final weights; we proceeded to taxi from the ramp onto Taxiway 1 for Runway XX (the runway of choice for inbound and departing transport and business aircraft). This route crosses active Runway YY/ZZ (the runway of choice for general aviation aircraft). Before crossing [Runway] YY/ZZ; we cleared both left and right; I made the call on the CTAF that we were crossing and crossed the runway. As we crossed; we saw a small aircraft already on the runway and possibly taking off. I didn't hear any calls on the radio and then realized I was still on the operations frequency. I made the advisory on the operations frequency and not CTAF. The small aircraft then taxied to the ramp from the approach end of [Runway] ZZ. I'm not sure if that aircraft aborted the takeoff or was simply taxiing to the hangar but it was an incursion nonetheless. The small aircraft was difficult to see and seemed to blend with the background buildings quite well. And coupled with my radio call error; we indeed had a runway incursion.
1904097,Aircraft X scheduled ZZZ to ZZZ1 departed [Runway] XXR and conducted a normal takeoff. Upon following the guidance of the MEL for single pack differed bleeds transfer; and after reducing N1 to 60% for the swap; a Left Pack HI Press Caution message on EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) and an associates Fault light on the Left Pack overhead panel appeared. The Captain (Pilot Monitoring) began the QRH for the associated message. The QRH procedure assumes the other Pack is operative; which for our plane was previously deferred; and as a result the aircraft was climbing out on the departure procedure in an unpressurized manner. The decision was to limit our final climb to 10;000 feet while working the problem. A Cabin Altitude Warning message appeared after the Left Pack HI Press QRH was completed. After completing all associated QRH and directed CFM procedures; it was determined that we would have to remain unpressurized and below an altitude that would allow for us to complete the flight segment to ZZZ1. Our fuel numbers suggested the best course of action was to return to ZZZ. After making the decision to return to ZZZ; we notified Dispatch and Maintenance Control via ACARS of the issue and plan to return to ZZZ. Our FA (Flight Attendant) was notified via his handset and briefed.The return flight required us to burn a little fuel to land under maximum landing weight; so we continued to maintain an altitude of 10;000 ft. to expedite the burn. The cabin temp reached as high as 35 Celsius during our flight. We landed back in ZZZ on Runway XXL and taxied to the gate without further incident.Deferred packs for ZZZ would be preferably fixed instead of deferred. Given the single pack taxi operations in summer weather; if a fix is not possible; maybe positioning the aircraft to fly northern rather than southern routes would be more comfortable for passengers.
1869925,On departure; [we] received [an] UNABLE RNP EICAS message. [We] believed [the message] to have been directly related to [a] local 5G NOTAM. Due to ATC informing us of [a] previous departure receiving effects of 5G-related malfunctions; [we] strongly believe this to be related to 5G near PDX. 5G near airports is a safety issue affecting automation and navigation.
1876119,Out of RNM; following RNM obstacle DEP PROC Runway 09. Tower requested switch to TRACON. Upon switching; sounded like female voice asked for ident. immediate ident broadcast; and no other transmission rec'd for Aircraft X. Reached 4k and started turn to hdg 330 when TRACON male voice indicated he rec'd a low altitude alert. Advised we were just beginning turn; and was given new hdg to 270. moments later; given new altitude of 5k; and ask to call TRACON as soon as practical. Remainder of flight unremarkable. Mild to moderate turbulence from takeoff to FAF at ZZZ.Phone call to TRACON; spoke to (male) Controller. Indicated the RNM obstacle DEP Runway 09 is 'watched' by TRACON very closely and it appeared we were not turning; requiring Controller to provide vectored deviations. Controller stated they have had many problems with this particular obstacle departure. Stated call was a learning tool for pilots; and he would file a report.Reviewed the obstacle departure procedure on the ground (again) and ADS-B data. We maintained a greater than 500 fpm climb; on the designated course (088) in medium turbulence; and began turn the moment we reached 4000 feet MSL. We believe the Controller may have changed positions and found us at that juncture; and was alerted and changed our course out of caution for our safety; based on previous issues (as the Controller had stated). We appreciate the concern and assurance of our safety by this Controller. We and the Controller agreed that this obstacle procedure requires updating to a safe and easy to understand format and route.This was both Pilots first experience using this RNM Runway 09 obstacle departure procedure and although felt we were inside the confines of the procedure; have now a heightened understanding of ATC focus regarding this departure; and most probably if flown again; request voca (over RNM); cross RNM at or above 5000 before proceeding on course; which would completely avoid the lower level terrain to the east.
1870173,We first noticed engine thrust surging during climb through 12;000 ft. The aircraft wasn't climbing at a normal rate. Then through 15;000 ft.; N1 on the number 1 engine was observed to be surging between approx 56% N1 and the climb target N1. We elected to level off at FL 190 to troubleshoot. This was difficult due to the absence of EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System) messages or abnormalities other than the N1 indications. The engine continued surging on and off for roughly 5 minutes between 56% N1 and the cruise target of about 79% before normalizing. A decision to request priority handling was made and along with our Dispatcher we elected to continue to ZZZ. The flight attendants were briefed on the situation. The rest of the flight was normal until initiating the descent at which time the number 1 engine surged again briefly and normalized again throughout the landing roll. Upon rollout ENG 1 NO DISPATCH EICAS message illuminated. The MX logbook entries were made and MX personnel met the aircraft at the Gate. I'll note that 2 MELs were present on the aircraft; ENG 1 short dispatch and engine 1 bleed system.
1893277,Noticed Captain's forward windscreen delaminating and arcing. A few seconds later; a loud pop; and the window shattered. It appears to be the outer panel. We begin the diversion to ZZZ and [requested priority handling]. There were no pressurization issues. We ran all QRH procedures and checklists and landed uneventfully in ZZZ.There wasn't anything we (the Crew) could've done to prevent this event. But; I was told numerous times yesterday that this event is happening 4-5 times a month.  Can you please tell me WHY this is happening?  This is potentially a very dangerous situation.  Why is it happening so frequently?
1874177,[I] noticed [a] strange odor on takeoff roll. Flight Attendants called passing about 7000 ft. Determined odor not dissipating; so [flight] returned to ZZZ.Cause - poor aircraft design.Suggestion - fix problem with contaminated air entering cabin/cockpit.
1910575,Window R1 (FO Windscreen) shattered. FL340 Mach .83 Captain (me) on break; FO and Relief Pilot flying. They ran the ECL checklists and at a natural break in the action called me to inform me of the event; according to our pre-break briefing. I came to cockpit and then they ran through the ECL/QRH again reviewing their action bringing me into the loop and up to speed. I then called Dispatcher via SAT phone requesting a conversation with him and Maintenance Controller. We observed only shattered outer glass pane; inner acrylic intact and stable. Maintenance reviewed our situation and then we formed our plan. We discussed (pilots; Dispatch and Maintenance) decided the situation was stable and proceeding to destination as flight planned was best option. We maintained FL340; informed ATC of situation with requested FL340 to destination. My FO and Relief Pilot followed the pre-break briefing by working the problem using the ECL and their experience to stabilize the situation. They efficiently and effectively followed established procedures. I reviewed their work and then we all discussed and reviewed the situation. I decided; considering their input along with Dispatcher and Maintenance that the best/safe course of action was to leave the airplane stable and continue to destination. Landed uneventfully.
1889463,Pulled up the front pit to raise the belt loader half way to jump in the pit to close the nets. After raising the belt loader half way; employee proceeded to engage the parking brake. However; belt loader malfunctioned and kept raising on its own. It ended up making contact with lower door lip. Employee lowered the belt loader to avoid further damage to the plane.  Employee informed his gate lead about the incident and asked him to put in the choke for the belt loader. Employee and the gate lead froze the scene and called in the incident.
1916028,I don't know exactly when this happened; but I believe it was sometime between XA:30 and XA:40 Eastern time. It may have been just a few minutes earlier.My student and I were coming back into ZZZ to land. We were told to expect XXR and were being brought to a left base for XXR (we were coming generally from the north). Runway XXL was also in use. We were being vectored by ATC and were maintaining 3;000 ft. MSL. The Approach Controller instructed us to 'fly heading 140; enter a left base for Runway XXR; descend and maintain 2;500 ft. for traffic'. I read this back while my student (the Pilot Flying (PF)) bugged the altitude and heading and initiated the descent. The controller then gave us the traffic advisory of a B737 at our 3 o'clock descending. I was looking for traffic but did not have visual on them. However; I did see them show up on our Multi-function Flight Display and this indicated they were below us. We were now level at 2;500 ft.. I finally got visual on the B737 off to our right as they were about to pass below us. They looked very close to us; but I never felt like we were in an unsafe position. I looked at the altimeter and it read 2;460 ft. or so. I took the controls to make sure we wouldn't descend any more and at that same time; we got a traffic advisory in our aircraft that indicated the traffic was 400 ft below us. We were on the assigned heading of 140. The rest of the flight continued as normal with no issues and we safely landed the aircraft.I really think the Approach Controller had us begin our descent just a little bit too early. Had we stayed at 3;000 ft.; we likely would not have gotten that TA. We probably would have needed to be vectored out a little bit further to ensure that we would have enough space to lose our altitude to land; but it could have prevented this situation. I think we should have had more of a buffer between the two aircraft. I also could have done a better job at making sure my student didn't drop that 40' down to 2460'; but I'm also not sure that that would have prevented us from getting the TA. If I had visual on the aircraft sooner; it's possible this would have been prevented but they were being covered by our wing so I couldn't quite see them until the last second.
1929760,Configured and flying jump run. The left wing appeared to have lost lift causing a spin. Aircraft control was recovered within 5;000 ft. While the event was happening; a couple of jumpers left the aircraft upon which some skin damage occurred. Was able to land the aircraft safely with the jumpers that remained on board. We had a loss of lift on the left wing; so it has stalled. After speaking with the Company; we are going to run the jump run at a higher speed.
1927497,Upon departing the FBO I taxied into a cone. The prop hit the cone with no decrease in RPM. Upon inspection of the prop and finding no issues I departed. The cone did not cause damage to any other aircraft or equipment. I was at an unfamiliar airport and did not receive the customary support from the FBO for parking or departure. However; the mistake was all my own and I plan to be more careful going forward.
1875954,We departed ZZZ and once at a positive rate; I called for gear up. Right as my First Officer raised the gear handle we encountered a bump of light to moderate turbulence. After the gear retracted we received a steering inop caution message. We climbed towards 10;000 feet and once we were on course; away from terrain and caught up with flying the airplane I transferred flight controls and radios over to my FO (First Officer). We checked the QRC then went onto the QRH and performed the checklist but were unsuccessful.We then discussed a plan and decided to continue to ZZZ1 and land on [Runway] XXC as it was the longest runway and the winds were favorable. At this point I returned to PF (Pilot Flying) duties. We asked ZZZ Center to forward our request to ZZZ1 for planning purposes and advised them we were not an emergency; then texted Dispatch and filled in the flight attendants.Once with ZZZ Approach they elected to provide priority handling for us and vectored us into [Runway] XXC. We came to a full stop on the runway; I set the parking brake and made a PA to advise the passengers that the ARFF vehicles were precautionary and we were working on a maintenance issue. The system reset procedure was successful so we cancelled our emergency and taxied clear of the runway.
1902773,About an hour out from ZZZZ we heard a muffled boom and air-frame vibration that lasted a couple of seconds. At which time we noticed a quick movement of the engine 1 gages. After that there was no vibration and the engine gages were all normal. Every thing was normal until the top of decent. On decent when the throttles went to idle the #1engine vib gage climbed to 3.7. When the power was brought back up the vib gage would drop down to .4 - .6. Ran the vibration check list which said if less then 4.0 continue as normal which we did. After landing we contacted [maintenance] at which time [maintenance] grounded the aircraft.
1899014,[There was a] ski bag leak. Ski bag checked in contained black liquid either paint or ink. Bag leaked out on other suitcases and ramp staff. Bag left behind and passenger informed.
1901981,Had a flight today to ROA. As setting up to descend into ROA we got the weather and notams. Winds were favoring Runway 24 so we started to set up for the RNAV Y 24 approach. We briefed all the terrain; and reviewed the company pages again since this is an airport known for unstable approaches. Approach Control vectored us onto the final approach course and told us to maintain '4000' I believe until established on the approach course. The FAF altitude was 3700. The Captain was flying this leg; and disconnected the autopilot and was hand flying during the intercept. We maintained 4000 ft. until we were fully established and almost right on the snowflake. We started a gradual descent (roughly 500-800 fpm) to get to 3700. After the final approach fix we were doing a normal RNAV (CAMPA) approach. We were on the snowflake if not the slightest bit high; as we were visual and didn't want any aggressive descent rates due to the terrain. We were visual the entire approach. I can't remember exactly how far past the FAF we were but we got for a brief second the 'terrain' the light barely even flashed on the 'GPWS' button. When we looked down we weren't more than 1000 fpm if anything more of 600 slightly above the snowflake and we'll clear of all terrain. So we continued the approach as we were stabilized. After the brief aural 'terrain' and light flash we didn't get anything else; nor nothing from ATC. Don't know if it was a malfunction of the terrain detection system; but wanted to write this brief summary.
1867926,Captain landed Runway XX and once he began to slow down; the aircraft began to slide off the runway due to possible unreported icing conditions for the runway. The aircraft had damage to the prop due to hitting multiple runway lights and ended up sliding off into a ditch from the ice.
1870427,On an empty ferry flight DEN-ZZZ; we were climbing to 11;000 ft. as our final cruise altitude. With no passengers the aircraft was climbing about 2;500 FPM through 10;000 ft. Around that same time the ADSB Fail light illuminated; we were aware that there had been reported GPS failures in the area and we got distracted when the light illuminated. We made the 1;000 ft. to go call out but by the time we looked back at the flight instruments we were passing 11;000 ft. and I was hand flying. I immediately began to correct and level off; we reached 11;500 ft. before returning to our assigned altitude of 11;000 ft.The entire time the ADSB fail message was illuminated; we were in heading mode. The ADSB FAIL light was only illuminated for a few seconds.There were no GPS deviations only a brief altitude deviation. The flight continued successfully with no other deviations and the GPS was operational the rest of the flight.When DEN and ZZZ are departing and landing south this is a very short flight. We were busy with our normal flight duties and a bit rushed. When the ADSB FAIL light illuminated I got distracted. The empty airplane had a much higher climb [rate] than normal. Both these things combined caused a slight altitude deviation.[I should] prioritize the state of the aircraft over the brief GPS outage especially in a high AOV [Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service] area. As pilot flying I should have utilized automation rather than hand flying in times of high work load to prevent deviation and reduce workload.
1893193,We brought the aircraft into ZZZ that morning. After landing; we received a message saying 'LG NO DISPATCH'. (I noted the previous day there was a voided out write up of the same message.) Once we parked at the gate and shut down the engine and hydraulics; the message disappeared. However; the left main inboard brake was showing about 42 degrees while the outboard was showing 242 degrees. I decided to call it in and explain everything that happened. Maintenance Control said they will call contract maintenance because they think this is a break temperature sensor issue. I hold off on boarding until the issue is resolved in case it's something worse. Contract maintenance shows up; swaps out the sensor; which fixes the issue; grabs the maintenance logbook and goes to fill it out saying we are good to board. We board up; get the can back and it was showing what they did with it sign and dated. We close up; get permission to push back and we do. Halfway through pushing we pull up the take off data to load it into the MCDU; and it's showing 'aircraft out of service'. We set the brake and I call maintenance to ask what is going on. It is then they advice me there is an issue with the paperwork and we are not legal and to return to the gate until they get it corrected. We hang up; tell the FAs; passengers; ramp; Dispatch; and operations what is going on and we needing to return to gate. It takes about 15-20 minutes but we finally get parked back at our gate. I call maintenance again to get a better idea of the issue. They explain how contract Maintenance took the brake sensor off of another one of our aircraft; but messed up how they wrote it up in that aircraft's maintenance logbook; which is causing us to be illegal. We had no idea we were not legal until I called about the out of service message. Contract Maintenance came out; took our maintenance logbook. Once all the paperwork was in line; they brought back the logbook. There were no changes to our log book. We closed up and departed without further problems. When on a maintenance delay; we want to leave as soon as possible; but to prevent something like this happening again; we should check the takeoff data to verify no 'aircraft out of service' messages appear and that we receive numbers. Scenario like this; past departure time; we usually have the passenger count and the bag count before we are ready for it; (as long as it's auto close out) we can check to see if we are good or not.
1903601,VFR weather with winds 150 at 5 kts. while landing on 4R. An Airbus landed 3 miles ahead of us and another aircraft departed Runway 9. While on very short final; I was the Pilot Flying with the automation off and we hit some wake turbulence around 50 ft. AGL and experienced a rolling event. I added power and corrected the rolling event and then proceeded to land in the touchdown zone safely; but it was a longer landing than desired. After debriefing; my Captain and I both agreed it would have been better to go around and try the landing again.
1881627,I completed the purchase of this airplane at XA00 local time this morning prior to departure. I went out for preflight and familiarization with the previous owner then departed for ZZZ. We departed ZZZ1 VFR and picked up an IFR in flight. Approximately 30 minutes into the flight the alternator voltage light illuminated and the engine data monitor showed that I was losing battery voltage. I then requested a diversion to another airport and was given clearance. Within 10 minutes of being on course I started losing avionics capabilities. I [requested priority handling] and squawked XXXX and took emergency action and diverted to the ZZZ2 airport which was 20 miles close. I was able to descend in VMC to approximately 1200 ft. MSL and remained VMC until landing. I had enough electrical power to extend the landing gear and deploy flaps. On landing I had 9.8 volts left on the battery. I was in constant communications with an overhead airliner and I relayed that I was down and safe. I also called ZZZ center on the phone and let them know that I was down and safe on the ground. Post flight inspection showed that the alternator belt had broken in flight. Factors that delayed earlier action is that I only had about 30 minutes of total flight time in this aircraft. I have flown similar make and model in the past however; the instrument package was not the same. I executed the alternator failure checklist per the POH and also turned off equipment not needed to execute the approach and landing. Performance was hindered due to my total experience in this airplane.
1921178,Got on plane in ZZZ last night and noticed a musty; moist; dirty sock smell immediately. FO (First Officer) had arrived first. I notice it just stepping on. Turn corner to cockpit FO asks 'Do you smell that?' APU Bleed on. I walked plane; smell throughout whole cabin. I stop FAs (Flight Attendants) in jet way from boarding. I wrote up dirty sock smell for Maintenance to correct. Crew exited. Passengers never boarded. In Company App next morning Maintenance said they discovered 'oil in bulkhead seal; intake flap door; LOAD Compressor drain line; APU oil cooler fan duct; and APU bleed drain valve.
1897371,"A few minutes after achieving cruise altitude; in level flight on autopilot; the airplane began to softly porpoise. I noted to the Co-Captain; Hey; do you see this mountain wave?"" We had just left ZZZ where we found quite a bit of turbulence. We thought the pitch changes and the feel of mountain wave off of the mountain range was what we were feeling. Finally; the airplane still on autopilot; took a couple more oscillations; each getting more aggressive and producing a climb and descent rate of up to 500 FPM. We called out to Air Traffic Control to make them aware that we were having trouble maintaining altitude due to turbulence. Just as my Co-Captain made the call; the airplane made an aggressive pitch up and tried to leave altitude. I instantly turned off autopilot and regained control. When I had the airplane in my hands; I could tell that it needed nose down trim. This is when I realized that the electric trim system had failed; causing the airplane to lose control of pitch. We immediately notified ATC that we in fact lost the electronic trim and autopilot. They responded and offered any assistance we would need. Ultimately; I flew the remainder of the short trip outside of RVSM by hand and landed at our home base without incident. The airplane has been checked into Maintenance and is scheduled for repair prior to any passenger flights. In recovery of the loss of electric trim; I believe the airplane reached 300 [ft.] above assigned altitude before I was able to bring it back down to the assigned FL260. I could have stopped it sooner but I did not know if the passengers (X) were seated; in the bathroom or whatnot; so I could not be too aggressive in the recovery because I did not want to send them into a ""negative"" G-loading; possibly sending them into the ceiling of the aircraft."""
1889455,737-700 pushed back from gate to spot Bravo. Employee followed procedures to remove bypass pin when brakes were set per policy and procedure. Employee put the pin in left gloved hand then proceeded to disconnect the wireless connector that allows communications to the cockpit and the push back driver. Employee put this device in left gloved hand as well. Employee then walked from right side of nose to left side of nose and headed back to gate.Once back at gate was putting equipment back into the lead box and realized that something was missing. Employee retraced steps and saw the bypass pin on the tarmac to just about 3 ft. from the left of the nose gear. The aircraft had already powered engines and was in the process of turning to the right because there was an Airbus directly in front of him.  Immediately notified the lead to get hold of supervisor or control center to have the aircraft stop or return to gate or something so that the bypass pin could be safely retrieved and removed from being a hazard on the tarmac/taxi area.The Captain/Crew did not get notified to stop and as the plane continued around the Airbus the bypass pin was ingested into the #1 engine. Employee and other members of the ground crew saw the bypass pin get lifted from the ground and into the engine and the noise that ensued. The flight had taxied away and when finally returned to gate; Maintenance met the aircraft.
1889479,We were flying the SERFR 4 RNAV arrival into SFO and were cleared for the Tip Toe Visual to Runway 28L after EDDYY. Prior to joining final we were given a heading of 350 and a speed of 210 knots and directed to descend to 4000 ft. Approach Control called out traffic; a B-777 that would be landing on the parallel runway. We visually acquired the traffic when it was turning base to final. We were then given a heading to join final (I believe it was 310 heading) and told to slow to 180 knots and maintain 3;000 ft. and were cleared the visual approach. The flying pilot then requested the flaps be selected from 10 to 20 degrees. We were told to keep the B777 in sight which we acknowledged and were cautioned about wake turbulence. After joining final we began a descent at the appropriate point. At approximately 2;800 ft. we encountered wake turbulence and the aircraft abruptly rolled left to approximately 70 degrees followed by an immediate roll to the right of approximately 70 degrees. The flying pilot countered both roll excursions with opposite aileron and we quickly recovered to level flight. We then continued the approach and landed with no additional wake turbulence encounters. I estimate that the horizontal distance between us and the B777 was 2-3 miles. The aircraft rolled rapidly to the left and right. Both insufficient lateral offset and horizontal spacing. This combined with winds that though reported at a direction that would possibly help keep the wake turbulence vortices away from our flight path (270 degrees reported by ATIS with the runway direction of 284 degrees); their direction was not enough to keep or blow the vortices away from us. Also; the winds on final were likely somewhat different than those reported by the ATIS and thus could have actually been blowing the vortices towards us. The flying pilot countered the left roll with opposite aileron and the right roll with left aileron. Having flown into SFO dozens of times; we frequently are flying approaches with other aircraft flying to the parallel runway. Advisories of wake turbulence are common and the appropriate mitigating techniques are employed. Given the same situation I would direct the flying pilot to slow sooner; offset slightly to the left of runway centerline and fly above the normal PAPI glidepath angle sooner.
1920971,[In the] morning about XA00 A.M. a pallet of material to be shipped out to Company field stations was brought down from ISSUING to SHIPPING. As the pallet was being separated by station code by Company specialist on duty; he discovered 6 boxes that were Hazardous Materials. He brought this to my attention I went out and took pictures and had Person A to take the boxes to our Hazardous materials department Controlled Material Storage (CMS) for processing. The M&E # are 99-XXXX-X-XXXX tracking tag# XXXXXXX ship request # XXXXXX. 99-XXXX-X-XXXX tracking tag# XXXXXXY ship request # XXXXXY. 99-XXXX-X-XXXX tracking tag# XXXXXXZ ship request # XXXXXZ. 99-XXXX-X-XXXX tracking tag# XXXXXXA ship request # XXXXXA. 99-XXXX-X-XXXX tracking tag# XXXXXXB ship request # XXXXXB. 98-XXXX-X-XXXY intransit # XXXXXXC ship request #XXXXXC.
1886199,Descending through approximately FL300 ECAM alerted us to a low quantity in the green hydraulic system. After confirming the low quantity on the overhead panel; we shut off the engine driven green hydraulic pumps. We followed the QRH procedures which had us turn off some spoilers; calculate new landing distance/speeds and gravity extend the landing gear. We [requested priority handling] and requested the longest Runway at ZZZ. After the plane was fully configured with gear down and flaps 40; I scanned the overhead panel and saw the green hydraulic quantity was normal. Landing was uneventful and we were towed to the Gate.
1891341,Experienced engine roughness and partial power loss; followed by engine surging. A CFI rated passenger contacted ZZZ Approach and informed them of the situation. Issue turned out to be fuel exhaustion in left tip tank; situation was remediated by switching to left main tank. Approx. 40 gallons on board at the time. Left tip drained unusually quickly due to slow fuel leak discovered after landing. Pilot error; believed fuel tank in use was left main tank which was full. No further issues encountered. No damage to aircraft as result; power was never lost completely.
1910474,I was training the D-side at Sector 21. Aircraft X departed FLL on the FEALX2 departure. Aircraft was longitudinally in the middle of 2 other aircraft also on the FEALX departure. The R-side climbed Aircraft X and continued working. Neither the R-side nor myself/trainee noticed Aircraft X make a sharp left turn after FEALX (on the boundary of MIA approach). Aircraft should have turned to BKING after FEALX; keeping them in Sector 21. However the aircraft turned north to about a 010 heading into sector 20. The R-side at sector 20 called us requesting the aircraft be turned to the east. Aircraft X never became traffic or lost separation with any other aircraft in sector 21 or 20. Unfortunately this is the NOT the first time this has happened since we have implemented metroplex. When this has happened in the past; most aircraft somehow miss a single fix on the SID and proceed to the LAST fix on the SID. However; the last couple instances the aircraft hits the fix (FEALX) on the MIA approach boundary then goes direct to the first fix after the SID; bypassing three other fixes (BKING; WOLFO; ETECK). Bypassing the other fixes turns them due north into sector 20 and 02; in conflict with arrivals. I'm not sure how it looks to the pilot when loading their flight plan into the FMS and since it is clearly not a single occurrence at this point; I'm not sure what the next step is to resolve the issue.
1915470,I was working a 2 Service on Aircraft X. A task card has me checking emergency lights. I noticed an emergency escape path lite inoperative at mid lav and documented it. The fix was the next shift found the wires capped and stowed so I do not know how long this went on being inoperative. I also made a separate report stating the emergency light assembly was not installed at door 1L with panlam covering the area where it should be. The wiring at that location was also capped and stowed.
1875904,Aircraft X. ZZZ-ZZZ1; we had a pressurization issue in which [we advised ATC]. Captain was the PF (Pilot Flying) and the PM (Pilot Monitoring) was FO (First Officer). Once we got to the aircraft we began our checks. Which the CA (Captain) performed his final cockpit scan. Though it is not on the CA's final cockpit scan. With the experience through the years; I always check the manual pressurization knob to ensure the knob is in the 'DN' position. Which at that time; it was full counterclockwise 'DN'. At the beginning of the trip there was several things going on. Runway XX had a NOTAM for Runway XX FICON 6/2/5 25 PCT WET; 60 PCT 1/4IN WATER; 30 PCT WET OBS AT Date/Time; #4 brake indicator pins were close to wear; the aircraft had to be de-iced and there was an issue on getting the clearance with the FO. Due to the busy work load; I talked to Dispatch couple of times for obtaining the APA numbers for the NOTAM runway and Maintenance for the #4 brake as well as coordinated with ops for de-icing. While we were getting ready to de-ice; the FO called up the FA (Flight Attendant) to tell him we were beginning de-icing and when he got off the phone the FO stated he had a hard time hearing him.While climbing through 13;200 ft.; we noticed the cabin altitude was around 8;700 ft. and climbing. When I saw this; the statement refer to QRH cabin altitude in amber was cut off by triple chimes 'CABIN'. I immediately asked the FO to request a descent to 10;000 ft. FO asked me if the emergency descent checklist should be ran and I stated yes. We alerted the Center of the problem and told them that we will get back to them if we needed assistance. Once leveling at 10;000 ft.; the I noticed the cabin altitude was at 9;500 ft. At that point; I radioed Center; [requested priority handling] and requested a descent to 8;000 ft. The altitude was granted; descent was initiated; FA and Dispatch notified. Once leveled at 8;000 ft. we set up and reviewed for visual approach to Runway XXC and went through the rest of the normal checklist. When we were caught up with everything; I started troubleshooting in my mind the pressurization issue. The first place I looked was the pressurization controller to see if there was error codes to report back to Maintenance as well as the AUTO/MAN switch position to ensure the controller was in fact AUTO. After looking at the pressurization controller; I inspected the manual pressurization control knob and discovered the manual pressurization control knob was in the 1 O'clock position. The knob was turned back to the 'DN' position and normal pressurization resumed. Asking the FO how that happened. He told me that while trying to adjust the volume to hear the FA in ZZZ1; that the knob he turned and forgot to place knob position back to 'DN'. After FO admitted to turning the switch; I explained that the only way that the volume for the intercom can be adjusted; is through the PA amplifier in the forward nose compartment. The rest of the flight was uneventful. Was not aware that after the before start checklist was complete that the pressurization manual control knob was placed in the 1 O'clock position by the First Officer. The only thing would be to do is ensure by both pilots; the pressurization manual knob is in the 'DN' position while taking the active runway for departure.
1881860,Descending through 5;000 feet on approach experienced light to medium fumes. Odor also reported by all inflight with light to medium in forward galley and more severe towards aft cabin with #4 flight attendant experiencing mild burning on upper lip and mild light headedness. Event reported as lasting approximately 5 minutes then dissipating.
1867196,Aircraft Y; a gyrocopter in the pattern at ZZZ utilized lower altitude to take advantage of right of way rules cutting off 2 aircraft in the pattern. Aircraft Y made a crosswind call in front of other traffic on the departure leg. During final approach in the pattern Aircraft Y laterally displaced themself right of the centerline; and proceeded back across the centerline in front of my aircraft causing a near mid air collision.
1879294,While operating above noted flight at 8000 ft. I noticed the left engine had increased to max indicated power on percentage and manifold pressure gauges. The fuel flow indicated 29 GPH. RPM remained at normal cruise of 2100. I retarded the left throttle and was able to return all engine indications to normal cruise power. This was about at the TOD (Top of Descent)  point and I had already been cleared discretion to 4000 ft. I began descent and made a minor increase in the left engine throttle position. There was an immediate loud bang and all engine instruments indicated an engine failure. I performed memory red box items and with the First Officers assistance completed the engine failure checklist. With the engine secured and the prop feathered I requested priority handling with Center. I was cleared direct to the airport and cleared for a visual approach. The destination airport was also the nearest suitable airport and the safest course of action. The landing was uneventful.
1891702,We departed ZZZ from Runway XXR on the ZZZZZ 3 Departure. ZZZZZ was the first fix on the LEGS page with LNAV/VNAV engaged. Sometime from setting takeoff trust to 1000 ft.; there became a discontinuity between the runway and ZZZZZ. After flap retraction I closed the discontinuity and re-verified the route. It was very turbulent with 20+ kts. of airspeed fluctuation. The airspeed started increasing rapidly and the aircraft climbing about 3000 FPM. My FO (First Officer) was flying; he was at flight idle and pitched down. We finally leveled off at about 8600 ft. MSL and about 305 kts. For about 1000 ft.-1200 ft. of climb we were along for the ride and the aircraft was not responding to control inputs. The crossing restriction and airspeed restriction at ZZZZZ2 is 230 kts. max and 8000 ft. or below. We crossed ZZZZZ2 at about 8600 ft. and 300 kts. After we got back down to 8000 ft. and slowed to 230 kts. it was very rough. After climbing to smoother air; I reported severe turbulence to ATC between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ2 from 7500 ft.-10;000 ft. ATC did not mention our altitude or airspeed deviation. I reported the turbulence to Dispatch via ACARS. We continued onto ZZZ1 and landed without incident. I had a conference call with Dispatch; the Superintendent of Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and the Chief Pilot on Call. I made an entry in the logbook about the severe turbulence and doing 300 kts. at 8600 ft.
1925572,On final; PAPIs 2 red 2 white. Check speed over the numbers and was approximately 10 knots over my desired speed of 75 knots. When initial touch down occurred the plane began to porpoise and became destabilized. Approximately 5 touches occurred before the plane veered off the runway and the front landing gear collapsed. Prop did strike the ground. Came to a complete stop. I had no injuries from the incident.
1898939,After taking off; we received a 'Too Low Terrain' and a yellow flashing RA on our screens. Terrain page was up and there was nothing but green dots and black on our page. At first I thought we may have been upside down or something because we were in the clouds and there was a B767 that departed not too long after. The PFD confirmed we were straight and level which is why I didn't overreact. MFD showed no red dots or anything that may have posed a terrain threat. After landing in ZZZ; I spoke to Pilot on Duty; and he said he's never seen that before. We both looked up 5G interference in the FOM; and there was no maintenance write up required per FOM. We also confirmed 5G NOTAMS were in NOT in effect so we determined 5G Interference would not be possible. We were also flying an aircraft with Load XX.Y. I thought it may have been that. With no certainty as to what the issue was; I did not know how to address it properly; and I did not document it in the maintenance log. It came to my attention a few days after the incident report was submitted; I should have submitted a report as well. Speak to Maintenance in situations like this; not just the Duty Pilot.
1873126,While I was preparing to wing walk a plane into [the gate] a vehicle started driving into the gate area.  The vehicle was heading straight towards me until the driver appears to have seen me and jerked the vehicle back. As the vehicle went by; the young man was texting or doing something on his phone while driving. This unsafe behavior could have easily led to an accident or injury and is inappropriate.
1902850,We did a 28k; bleeds off takeoff; out of ZZZ. After climb out; my Captain reset the bleeds by the checklist. We continued our climb. Around 28;000'; my Captain noticed the cabin altitude was at 10;000' so we leveled off at 28;000'; saw it was still climbing and started a descent after letting ATC know. By the time we got to 27;000; the cabin alt warning went off. We donned our O2 masks and established communication. My Captain started doing all his tasks; and I started a priority descent; being vectored by ATC towards ZZZZ1. Once passing through 10;000' we removed our masks; and continued through all the checklists; and calls to dispatch; and the FA's; etc etc. Once the Captain had caught up with those duties; we turned back inbound on the approach to Runway XX at ZZZZ1; where we performed and overweight landing. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) checked our brakes for temp; and we proceed to the gate. We were familiar with the bleeds off takeoff; having performed it 2 days prior. Upon thinking back afterward; when the Captain did the bleeds reset; he remembered that the bleed pressures did not come back up when reset. I did not see the pressures because I was hand flying at the time. The Captain had also just come off X months of leave and was his first trip back flying. It was also a very long day; 3 legs; previous leg had 2 plane swaps; delaying us; and putting us just a few minutes shy of a max 13 hr duty day. I should have been watching more closely when he changed bleeds and I might have caught it.
1883746,During climb through FL340 level 2 Inertial Reference Unit 2FAIL illuminated followed by level 2 LSAS ALL FAIL and YAW [Maintenance Planner] ALL FAIL and an autopilot disconnect. Transferred control to Captain and coordinated a descent to FL270. Complied with all Quick Reference Handbook procedures. Called Dispatch and Maintenance on the SatPhone and with Dispatch concurrence coordinated an [Amended Release] for a return to ZZZ. Uneventful approach and landing at ZZZ.
1878079,On Date about XA:45 local time; I was working on traffic patterns with a student at ZZZ. We were in the left downwind of the traffic pattern on Runway XX. Abeam the end of the runway we were instructed to fly a right 360 degree turn; upon the completion of the turn we extended the downwind; then were told to complete another right 360 degrees turn. While exiting the second turn; we were given a traffic alert at 11 o'clock. I spotted the traffic in the right traffic pattern for the same runway; along with traffic on final. It was under my assumption that I was then able to turn final after the aircraft. I began to turn towards Runway XX; then I received a traffic alert in my aircraft; so I took control from the student; lifted the wing and saw the Citation crossing over the top of my aircraft. I turned out of their path towards the left; and rejoined the downwind. The Citation went missed; due to the resolution advisory they received. I extended the downwind; and was cleared to land. I was not instructed to contact the Tower; but did so myself in hopes to resolve an issue if one arose. I believe this could have been avoided by asking us to extend the downwind for traffic farther out. After leaving two 360 degree turns within a short distance of one another makes it hard to pick out traffic; in which was supposed to be referenced.
1891563,We were on arrival into DEN on the AALLE3 arrival; just passing the fix 'DOGGG' at 11;000; and Approach Control gave us descend and maintain 8000; we responded with the same instruction and descended to 8000. While we were descending Approach said there was wind hear advisors in effect and that there had been multiple go arounds. The frequency was congested and other aircraft were being called by Approach Control to speed up for spacing and aircraft were responding with unable. Approach Control responded that she was trying to space out all aircraft to give everyone a chance for approach to land. Approach Control called us and instructed us to descend and maintain 6;500 feet and my FO (First Officer) repeated the clearance; at this time the approach Controller 'did not' reply with an altitude correction or change. Approach Control instructed us to turn heading 270 and slow to 190 knots; my FO repeated the instruction. I increased my descent to 2;000 feet per minute and made the right turn to 270; however my speed was increasing to 220 so I extended the spoilers to slow to 190. I reached up to slow my descent rate; and I realized autopilot did not capture 6;500 feet; I looked down and my speed was decreasing to 185-190 knots. The low speed indicator increased with the stall margin indicator; and we got the terrain warning once and I immediately and simultaneously; disconnected autopilot and got a momentary stick shaker. I stowed the spoilers; added max thrust; and leveled for a split second and as speed increased with no drag I initiated a climb up to 7;500 feet. I advised my FO to tell Approach we were correcting; Approach was calling to confirm our altitude and advise us that we should be at 7;500 feet and they received a low altitude alert for us. My FO advised approach that we were climbing to 7;500 and Approach responded with everyone watch their altitudes; and advised us to turn heading 325; and maintain 150 knots until FRONZ and cleared us for the visual to 35R. My FO repeated the clearance. The winds were extremely gusty and our turn was wider with the strong winds and windshear. At this time the intercept heading came to late from approach; and I overshot the approach course and I was already in a turn to re-intercept the approach course. We intercepted the course; and were configuring to be stabilized by the final approach fix FRONZ. We were fully configured and stable by FRONZ and approach instructed us to contact Tower; Tower cleared us to land. After being cleared to land; we encountered windshear caution; but continued and then Tower called and advised us to expect a loss of 30 knots at 150 feet; we continued and made a safe landing on Runway 35R.I believe the cause of this event was due to Approach giving us an altitude of 6;500 feet; a heading instruction and speed reduction instruction. I believe the terrain warning which alerted Approach; was due to an aggressive descent rate with autopilot connected at a low altitude. I believe the stick shaker was caused by the fully extended spoilers which I had extended to slow to 190 knots per approaches speed restriction and my aggressive pitch up attitude to level off at 6;500 feet. We became immediately task saturated with a congested frequency we were not able to query in time. I could have requested my FO query Approach about the altitude restriction; and I could have requested to slow early and decreased my descent rate. In the future; I will take the initiative exercise my authority in having my FO's query about instructions given by ATC to insure no miscommunications; and prevent task saturation; which will allow greater focus of the whole environment.
1910447,I accidentally flew in a TFR. There was a fire yesterday evening just outside of ZZZ. I sometimes do free video and pictures; of news events; for a local news organization. I checked sky vector app on my phone to see if there's any restrictions. It did not say that there was. I also checked Flightradar24 to see if there were any aircraft in the area. There was not. I was south of the road and flew for about 10 minutes. As I got done and was leaving a Public Official that I know pulled up and said that I shouldn't be flying and that the Public Information Officer wanted to talk to me. When I got over to the other side where the Public Information Officer was he informed me of the TFR. And search-and-rescue we fly in and deal with TFRs all the time. So I know the importance of them. The Information Officer name was Person A. He stated that he would probably not report it; since there were no aircraft in the area. But I want to make sure that I'm doing everything by the book. I apologize to him and his guys for any issues that it may have caused. I do fly in conjunction with law enforcement and other emergency service agencies so am very well aware of what needs to happen and thought my bases were covered when I checked the apps.
1901790,I was on final for Runway XX (which had been the active runway all day) and was in radio contact with other traffic and ground radios while making all traffic calls (downwind; crosswind; final; etc). Multiple witnesses can verify that my radio was functioning properly and clearly.While on final; an Extra 300 passed directly below me from an approach for Runway XY. I did not hear any radio communications from the other plane until he apologized for flying head-on underneath me.I then climbed back to pattern altitude and immediately departed the area.
1924901,When working Boeing 777; I encountered Drag Brace springs in pre pull kit are wound opposite of what was removed. Form 8130-3 has same part number for a wind counter clockwise and a clockwise wind. This seems like we have a problem that needs to be addressed. This is also a work process that is on the RII list and there is no QA block on pattern cards. We have determined the different springs are from different vendors and that the opposite wound springs could be out flying on multiple airplanes.
1917460,Event occurred in ZZZ on XX at XX:30. Saw [Dangerous Goods Form] on scanner; tried pulling up on DG [program] and was not on there. Doubled checked several times and still nothing showing up.The event occurred as I was in the middle of verifying everything to finalize and the Pilot was requesting for [Dangerous Goods Form] paper and I had told him there was no [Dangerous Goods Form] showing up on my end on the computer but also the freight never showed up so I had to refuse the 230 lbs. of [Dangerous Goods] freight. Then Pilots; Towers; Gate Agents and [Manager] kept repeatedly asking for [Dangerous Goods Form] paperwork but there was no paperwork only thing that was put on the aircraft that was dangerous goods was dry ice. Then another [Ramp] came over and tried it herself then I showed her what I had showed the [Manager]. I ended up taking the dry ice that I had put in F1 off the aircraft; removed it and the other [Ramp] overlooked everything I did and still gave her the same thing. I had called the Load Planner several times and he told us that we were going to have to close it out manually; so we went inside the gatehouse and tried to close it out manually for 30 minutes. It wouldn't let us close it out we called the load planner to double check if it was closed out on their side; he said it wasn't he said we have to wait until it refreshes before it can go through. That's when 30 minutes went by and it finally went through.Kept pulling up [program] for [Dangerous Goods Form] and was still not showing no paper work. Waited to see if the 230 lbs. of freight was going to show up. Pilot later said he needed paper work but there was no [Dangerous Goods Form] for the freight that never showed and was refused. The only dangerous goods that was on the aircraft was the Dry Ice and verbally told the Pilot there was no paperwork for [Dangerous Goods] showing up and I had refused one of the dangerous goods. [Manager] was standing there and I had told him to come with me in the gatehouse so I can show him on the computer and what's showing up. He saw everything as I was going step by step with him with the process.[Manager] was hovering over my shoulder and the other [Ramp]. We called the Load Planner and notified the Tower as they kept calling but it was too many people calling all at once as we were being micromanaged with the [Manager] standing over us trying to close out the flight.
1878217,While in cruise; both the First Officer (FO) and I smelled what appeared to be an electrical odor. I called back to the Flight Attedent's (FA) to ask if they had any unusual odor in the cabin. They said that they did with a very light haze in the cabin. The FO and I accomplished the QRC for SMOKE; FIRE or FUMES which then lead us to QRH Chapter 8 SMOKE; FIRE or FUMES Checklist. We accomplished steps 1-12. I read step 12 as we had extinguished the source through previous steps. The smell had dissipated as did the haze in the cabin; which in my opinion confirmed that the situation was contained. We then moved to item 13. At that point I contacted Dispatch and informed them of the entire event and discussed with them our options and their preference. I conferred with the FO and all FAs and apprised them that it was my intent to continue on to our destination; but if anyone did not feel comfortable with this decision; that we would divert into ZZZ. At that time we were about 30 minutes east of ZZZ. Dispatch had also said that based on the information that we gave them; and having spoken with Maintenance; asked if we were comfortable to continue to destination. I informed them that we would continue on and would divert to ZZZ if the fumes returned. As I sit and spend more time reading this QRH out of the Cockpit; I could see how maybe we should have have diverted as the smoke; fire or fumes were not 'obvious' although it was obvious through the absence of smell and haze the source was 'isolated and extinguished.'
1905787,During the post flight inspection in ZZZ; I noticed there was a box of Biohazard B UN3373 in the aft cargo bin. I did not recall seeing any cargo listed on the auto close out report. I notified the ramp crew who was unloading our aircraft that there is cargo in the aft bin and they also stated that their records showed that there should not have been any cargo in the aft bin. The Weight and Balance report in software confirmed there was no reported freight in the aft cargo bin.
1892503,A seemingly simple deferral of the Left Anti-Ice Cowl Valve locked in the open position creates some significant safety concerns in the unlikely; but not unheard of; event of loss of all AC power. The HMG (Hydraulic Motor Generator) is not available in this scenario due to the way that the pneumatic system is to be operated with the cowl valve locked open. So if a complete loss of AC power were to occur; then the following checklist item XX WARNING from the (YYY) AC BUS OFF - L (R) Non-Normal checklist (page X of the 757-767 FM) would apply: 'XX WARNING: If the HMG fails or is inoperative; flight beyond 30 minutes will result in complete loss of electrical power and the inability to lower gear and flaps.' So in analyzing the flight on MM/DD/YYYY; 138 minute ETOPS was planned using ZZZZ1 and ZZZZ2 as the ETOPS alternates. (Actual condition times for the diversion were even greater than the 138 minutes planning assumption due to forecast winds.) So the possibility of losing all electrical power is almost a certainty if the loss of AC power occurs at or near the Critical Point. And this could even be an issue when only 60 minutes from an Intermediate Airport.So in considering those possibilities with consultation with Dispatch; I determined that the prudent and safe course of action was to refuse this aircraft; nose number xxxx. Safety is our number one principle; and I acted with that in mind. Also; I coordinated with Maintenance using the code as outlined in pilot bulletin; unable to operate procedure; so that a 'UNABLE TO OPERATE' log item was entered into the aircraft history. Lastly; I just could not see how I could defend taking the aircraft if an unlikely; but not unheard of; loss of all AC power were to occur. And if I did end up in a situation as described in the warning; would I even be able to safely recover the aircraft so that I could defend the decision? That is a question I did not want to have to answer.
1892072,Aircraft tail rotor bolts were observed on aircraft after maintenance to be in a different configuration then previously observed. Aircraft had been released for operations by maintenance personnel. Reference to a second aircraft showed same configuration. Aircraft was flown with this configuration.  Maintenance employees were questioned on the different configurations on bolts; and found previous installation was incorrect.Suggestions - ensure AMTs and pilots are made aware of the correct orientation of the through bolts; that the fasteners are to be exposed and visible.  Perhaps a note or caution in the maintenance documentation as to the importance (if any) of correct orientation of the bolts.
1877986,While loading mail onto Aircraft X  to ZZZ at  XA40 there was a 5-gallon bucket with liquid inside. I placed it on the side of belt loader to look at later. I called the CSM (Customer Service Manager) on duty out to look at it. I did not load this bucket.I went to pick up the bucket and realized it was full of liquid so I set it aside to figure out what it was a bit later. I called the CSM out to the plane and he was reading the label as I was loading the other mail. He read on the shipping label that it says it is oil in the bucket.Company Y shipped with the post office a 5 gallon bucket full of marine oil.  The post office sent a bucket full of marine oil as mail to be place on a passenger airplane. Company Z (our cargo/mail contract company) loaded the bucket into a cart and brought it down planeside to be loaded.I notified CSM. After flt pushed I brought the bucket into OPS so that they could give it back to Company Z to return to mail facility.Company Y needs to be told that if they ship this mail it can not go onto passenger aircraft. Mail facility that accepted it needed to handle it properly and NOT load anywhere that would get it to be sent on a passenger aircraft. Cargo/mail handlers need to be trained and aware of this type of shipment so it doesn't make it planeside on a passenger aircraft.
1907886,Was on short final to Runway XX after flying a coupled approach on the RNAV approach. Spoke to another aircraft waiting to takeoff while I was still on a 5 mile final and told him he was OK to takeoff and he did successfully. While approximately .30 miles from the runway and approx 300-400; AGL Heard a radio call from a helicopter that was on a right base to Runway XX. Advised on frequency that I was a Skylane and a very short final and landing. As I looked up from my display I caught sight of the helicopter just off my nose to the right. Immediately added full power and banked hard to the left in a climbing left turn. Advised on frequency that I was going around and flew south of the field to re-enter a left downwind for Runway XX. We both landed without incident. The other pilot met me at my hanger and apologized for his late radio call. We had a discussion about proper traffic pattern entry. I believe that the nonstandard entry of the helicopter to the traffic pattern was a factor. I also believed that the lack of radio calls from the helicopter was also a factor. The other pilot even made the comment that this was a 'very quiet little airport and they didn't have to usually worry about other traffic'. Im not saying that I am a perfect pilot by any means but this type of complacency is what causes these type of issues. I am not a helicopter pilot and do not know all of the regulations that they are bound by for traffic pattern entry; however I believe a more standardized entry and flow would have stopped this from happening. I also believe standard radio procedures and callouts would have also resolved this.
1914638,Normal flights from ZZZ3 - ZZZ2 - ZZZ1. No indications of any anomalies. Normal engine starts in ZZZ1 for flight to ZZZ4. Oil quantity at start in ZZZ1 - Eng 1 10 QTS; Eng 2 12 QTS. First Officer (FO) pilot flying (PF) on this leg; Captain was pilot monitoring (PM). Normal departure off Runway XL in ZZZ1 with routing as filed: ZZZZZ 2 ZZZZZ1 ZZZZZ2 ARXX ZZZ5 JXXX ZZZ6 JXXY ZZZ7 ZZZZZ3 4. Filed for FL370. Flying assigned route. Leveled at FL350 for several minutes where we accomplished the cruise checklist; then given the climb to FL370. FO made the 2;000 foot climb at cruise power in a cruise climb which was fine by me. Upon reaching FL370; rechecked the cruise checklist items. Soon after reaching FL370; PM noted engine #2 ITT began a fluctuating climb rapidly reaching toward redline. Captain verbalized issue to FO. Both pilots saw ITT (Interstage Turbine Temperature) passing redline; noted 979 degrees C. FO began retarding #2 engine thrust lever and both pilots noted continued ITT rise; and Captain noted oil pressure at 0; and ITT at 1;000 degrees C. Now; remember it takes longer to read these last sentences than it took in actual time; as the Captain directed and assisted the #2 thrust lever to idle and turned the #2 Start/Stop Selector to STOP. Proper confirmation techniques were used. FO disconnected the Autopilot; trimmed the aircraft and verbalized the need for a descent as Captain notified ATC of the loss of an engine and requested a descent. Flight initially given a descent to FL240 which the FO hand flew. ATC also provided a turn to the southwest. At about this point; the FA (Flight Attendant) called on the intercom. Captain responded and advised we had lost an engine and were beginning a descent. Advised flight attendant (FA) quite busy at the moment and would call her back; adding a question of there was something urgent. Nothing immediately urgent and a return call was made to the FA within a minute when she advised she noted smoke in the cabin. Questioning indicated that the smoke was almost undetectable except in the sunlight coming through the windows; was maintaining or dissipating. Captain asked for updates and advised he would have more information shortly and would make a cabin announcement when able. FA advised to interact with and calm the passengers as necessary to answer any questions and advise the Captain would be making an announcement shortly. ATC requested intentions and Captain advised they wanted to land at the nearest suitable airport and requested ATC provide airport options. ATC advised ZZZ8 and ZZZ9 closest (later investigation revealed distances nearly the same). Captain elected ZZZ8 and flight was given a direct to ZZZ8 clearance. Flight did not declare; however; ATC advised they were prioritizing the flight. In the Captain's judgment; the flight was stable; under control; the smoke report was noted yet not an issue at the time; and there was no need for drastic actions beyond the normal descent and turn toward a suitable airport. The QRH was consulted; memory items having been performed appropriately for an engine out. The fire handle was not actuated as there was no indication of fire. QRH was completed for engine out item and the APU was started; the APU bleed turned on and the crossbleed turned on. The single engine landing checklist was reviewed. Once secured; the Captain confirmed with the FA the smoke status had dissipated and then she reported hearing a 'pop' sound just before it appeared; and then the Captain made a PA to advise the passengers they were diverting to ZZZ8; the issue was under control; there was no immediate reason for concern; and that he'd update them as able. The FA was asked to prepare the cabin for landing. ATC requested and was provided SOBs and FOB information. Descent was further cleared to 12;000. FO at some point asked to and was granted permission to reengage the Autopilot; which then remained on until the Captain took control at 3;000 ft. on the visual approach and landing at ZZZ8. The crew completed the Single Engine Landing checklist and set the speeds. During the descent; EICAS message ENG 1 FIRE DET FAIL. Obviously; this created further discussion on a possible issue with engine #1; but by the time the QRH was accessed; the EICAS message cleared and did not return. Discussion of altitude control was initiated just in case something developed in the remaining engine. FO utilized good judgment in minimizing thrust on engine #1 during descent and leveling at 12;000. Engine 1 indications remained stable and normal. Flight transitioned to a normal approach using flaps 22 and Vref of flaps 45 (based on emergency return numbers based on takeoff weight for conservative position) plus 10 kts. A landing was made on Runway XXL in ZZZ8. Tower had mobilized the rescue vehicles. Captain determined the flight could exit the runway and pulled clear; stopped and made contact with the rescue vehicles. The FO was asked to request an inspection of the aircraft and engine #2 for indications of damage or fire while the Captain made a short PA to advise the passengers to remain seated and they were going to taxi to the gate after the inspection. FA reported some passenger agitation when they observed the rescue vehicles; but they remained in control. Rescue crews reported no visible damage or evidence of fire. The flight had advised ATC on the approach they would like to go to FBO upon arrival and was subsequently cleared to taxi to FBO; which had personnel deployed to the ramp to guide the aircraft to parking and then secured with chocks. Captain shut down the #1 engine and the parking checklist was performed. Communication was established with FBO to obtain a ramp which they eventually obtained from another FBO. While we waited Captain took a call from Name at [operations] just as he was picking up the phone to call [them]. It should be noted that once established toward ZZZ8; the Captain attempted to contact ARINC on both radio frequencies with no response. It was my intention to communicate with [operations] our condition and intention and seek any guidance which they could provide. Additionally; to make pre-arrangements for service and passenger handling upon arrival. Captain left the cockpit with the FO in control to personally address the passengers. They were calm and attentive with much of their concern being 'What now?'. The Captain advised them he had communicated with Operations and that passenger arrangements were being made as they spoke and he'd coordinate updated information as it was received. During the wait for the ramp the Captain communicated the events to Maintenance and made additional briefings to the passengers. Eventually the ramp was obtained; stationed by the FO and the crew performed a briefing on how to deplane the passengers. FBO provided vans on the ramp to take the passengers and their luggage to the FBO lounge. FBO unloaded the baggage compartment with the assistance of the Captain. The FA controlled the exit to one passenger at a time; the FO stationed on the ramp at the aircraft door to assist each passenger's transition from the aircraft to the ramp; the Captain positioned on the ramp stairs to further assist to the ground; where FBO personnel directed each passenger to the vans. The crew secured the aircraft with gear pins; ensured chocks were properly installed; closed the cargo door; shut down the APU and the leaving the aircraft checklist was completed. The Captain did a final check and went to the FBO along with the FA and FO. Captain checked in with the passengers. Additional phone calls with Name; and [operations]. Maintenance contacted the Captain and asked he return to the aircraft to power up the avionics and APU to pull up maintenance pages on the MFD. Captain re-secured the aircraft and returned to the FBO to communicate with the passengers. Once all the passengers were accommodated by Customer Service; Captain; FO and FA took a van to the main terminal where they were to catch a carrier flight to ZZZ4 to pick up the schedule on Day 1 with a repositioned aircraft being delivered to ZZZ4 on the morning of date. It should be noted that the FO and FA performed their jobs with exceptional professionalism and calm demeanor. They were both assessed by the Captain as well as self-assessed for fitness to continue duty and pick up the schedule the following day. Captain's assessment of the passengers was they were all calm; uninjured; unstressed; and comfortable and happy with the service options provided by Customer Service. Aside from the ARINC failure; the crew and support staff performed admirably and with true courtesy; customer-centric attention; and professionalism.
1899587,I was the Part 141 check pilot administering a commercial pilot stage check for a student in the university flight program. The flight started off well; with the student performing as desired. After several maneuvers; I could sense the student was getting stressed; and the maneuver quality started to diminish. We were at the half-way point on the stage check; and were going to do short and soft field takeoffs and landings at ZZZ. The student entered the pattern correctly; was the appropriate distance in downwind; base and final. Upon rolling out on final; I noticed the speed was showing 80 kts. It should be closer to 70 kts; with the intent and energy of slowing to 61 kts by short final. I was hoping the student would elect to go around; as is allowed in the CPL ACS; but the student decided to continue the approach.  It resulted in an unstable final; with improper control inputs to achieve the desired state. The result was forcing a landing onto the runway; landing flat and 400' long. After touchdown; the student stood on the brakes for max braking; but locked up the left main; and we heard the hiss from the tire being blown; followed by the airplane pulling to the left. We came to a stop about 1600' down the runway and then shut the airplane down while still on the runway. After deplaning and inspecting the tire; we decided it was best to tow the airplane to the ramp with the left main gear on a dolly. With no maintenance personnel at the airfield; the student and I worked together to tow the aircraft safely back to the ramp. Once the replacement tire and brake assembly were replaced; and maintenance was satisfied; we performed a brake check with the mechanic nearby. All was successful; so we departed to the home airport without further incident. I gave the student the option of flying back or letting me fly. The decision was made that I would fly back; with the student on the radios.To prevent this from occurring in the future; I could end the flight earlier if it isn't going well; and also try to make the student feel less stressed in an already stressful environment.  Some factors that I'm sure played a part were the following: end of a semester (pressure to complete the course after delays for maintenance and weather that cancelled earlier flights); no local housing - student had a 2 hour drive to the airport; and it was one of the warmest days of the year with more updrafts than previously flown in while performing the commercial maneuvers. A risk assessment was completed prior to the flight; but that doesn't mean that the flight was risk-free. As pilots gain experience; they start to make better decisions. We as instructors need to foster that decision making process early in their flying career. An instructor with 20 years experience will have a different outlook than one with 2 years experience. Seasoned instructors have a responsibility to mentor new instructors when it comes to the decision making process. Unfortunately; sometimes experience is the best teacher. Good judgement comes from experience; but experience comes from bad judgement.
1912386,On Day 1 around XA:30; while administering a Private Pilot ASEL checkride; a flap malfunction occurred while the applicant/PIC was recovering from slow flight. The applicant attempted to retract the flaps from 30 degrees to 10 degrees. At 10 degrees; the right flap failed. A loud noise was heard. It appeared that the leading edge of the right flap had 'buckled'. The applicant/PIC tested the roll capabilities of the airplane and found no controllability issues. The flaps were left at the 10 degree position as to not cause any further damage. The applicant/PIC choose to discontinue the checkride and return to the originating airport - ZZZ. The descent; approach to land and landing were non-eventful. The event was report to the owner/operator of the flight school. A follow-up on the matter was initiated by the owner/operator. He reported that his mechanic found the flap roller to be out of specifications causing the flap malfunction/damage. Repairs are being initiated.
1867315,XX Gate in ZZZ needs to be redesigned or converted to a dedicated RJ Gate; due to shorter wingspan. On taxi in traffic on the access road would not stop to allow us to enter the alley. The ground traffic continued to pull up to the traditional stop bars. They had no way of knowing they needed to use the alternate ones adjacent to the Gate. Further at night that traffic blinds you with their headlights making it impossible to see the guide men. Lastly during push back traffic on the access road was driving around our aircraft. This put them dangerously close to our ground personnel and aircraft. Basically our wings were far over the road. Traffic approaching behind the aircraft merely side stepped and zipped past us. One vehicle drove past our guide person by less than 5? I was concerned that he was going to be hit. That road is unacceptably dangerous. Reserve that gate for smaller aircraft. Educate all people with driving access to not drive around aircraft while parking there.
1884557,After pushing back; start; and initial taxi on the ramp; we had not received final weights. Using radio 2; I called operations to get a status on the weights. I was also using radio 2 for CTAF advisories. After getting the final weights; we proceeded to taxi from the ramp onto Taxiway 1 for Runway XX (the runway of choice for inbound and departing transport and business aircraft). This route crosses active Runway YY/ZZ (the runway of choice for general aviation aircraft). Before crossing [Runway] YY/ZZ; we cleared both left and right; I made the call on the CTAF that we were crossing and crossed the runway. As we crossed; we saw a small aircraft already on the runway and possibly taking off. I didn't hear any calls on the radio and then realized I was still on the operations frequency. I made the advisory on the operations frequency and not CTAF. The small aircraft then taxied to the ramp from the approach end of [Runway] ZZ. I'm not sure if that aircraft aborted the takeoff or was simply taxiing to the hangar but it was an incursion nonetheless. The small aircraft was difficult to see and seemed to blend with the background buildings quite well. And coupled with my radio call error; we indeed had a runway incursion.
1893504,Flight uneventfully departed ZZZ for ZZZ1 with three passengers; continuing until initial descent into ZZZ1. Soon after initiating an ATC-directed normal descent from FL450; crew experienced physiological symptoms of a rapidly increasing cabin altitude. Crew immediately confirmed this by observing cabin altitude rising from approximately 8;000 feet at a rate of between 4;000 fpm and 6;000 fpm on the cabin pressurization controller; and moments later; a 'MASTER WARN' with 'CABIN ALT' CAS (Crew Alert System) annunciation.PIC called for; and crew executed; emergency checklist memory items for CABIN ALT (Item K2). Crew then observed cabin altitude maintaining approximately 15;000 feet; and referencing remaining printed items; noted 'procedure complete'. Crew contacted ATC; requesting a lower than previously cleared-to altitude; and requested priority handling. Crew was cleared incrementally to FL240; and descended uninterrupted to this altitude at an increased rate of approximately 3;000 fpm to 4;000 fpm. While in this descent; PIC elected to complete emergency checklist item K1(a); for 'Cabin Pressurization Controller Failure.' PIC was successful in regaining control of cabin pressurization with controller in 'manual' mode; lowering the cabin altitude to approximately 8;000 feet.Upon reaching FL240; crew again checked condition of passengers; receiving a 'thumbs up.' Crew discussed the situation; the condition of the aircraft; and possible courses of action; including diversion to ZZZ2 or continuation to ZZZ1; which were now approximately equidistant in time. Crew determined the pressurization system was now under control with cabin altitude remaining constant below 8;000 feet; and advised ATC and passengers of intention to continue to ZZZ1. Crew were cleared to lower altitude; and a shallow descent was initiated soon after; allowing for best control of the pressurization system.Crew completed Normal Checklist items; and conducted an uneventful visual approach and landing at ZZZ1. Due to the incident occurring while already in descent; as well as further timely and effective altitude and route clearances by ATC; the exercising of PIC emergency authority was deemed unnecessary.Upon deplaning; crew queried passengers about their physical and mental condition; and were advised that they had felt a change in cabin temperature and pressure that caused discomfort to their ears; and donned their oxygen masks when they dropped automatically. Passengers otherwise acted and appeared normally; though reporting that their ears were still slightly 'plugged.' All three passengers left the premises in their private vehicle soon after.PIC then notified Dispatch of the incident; and asked them to notify CP (Chief Pilot) and DOM (Director of Maintenance) to expect PIC's call after securing the aircraft. Crew then secured the aircraft as-normal; and after speaking with CP and DOM; completed a Discrepancy Log entry for a rapid decompression; as coordinated with DOM.
1906763,Towards the end of boarding B FA (Flight Attendant) asked if I smelled anything unusual aft of the aircraft; I didn't; we waited some more. B FA had communication with flight deck and said that there was a smell aft of the aircraft. I then moved to the left aft of the aircraft to see if I could notice it and did; B FA and I thought it was coming from air vents on top ably everything jump seats. Then pilots made an announcement to let passengers know we might have to deplane; then when we did deplane; maintenance happened.
1915210,On climb out; received 'CAB PR SYS1 FAULT' Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). SYS 2 worked normally. Referenced the FM and continued. At FL340; received 'CAB PR EXCESS ALT' ECAM with associated master warning. We flew the airplane; silenced the alarm and confirmed the [problem]. The Captain directed me to continue to fly the aircraft and we donned our masks and established comms. He got clearance to descend from ATC and I initiated our descent. The ECAM cleared and reappeared at least once during the descent. During the descent; the Captain let the flight attendants (FAs) know what was going on and they mentioned that the emergency lights came on but that the masks did not drop. We leveled at 10;000 ft. and elected to return back to ZZZ1 since the FAs reported that there were no injuries on board. I coordinated the return with ATC while the Captain informed the passengers of what had happened and communicated with Dispatch. On final at ZZZ1; we received a 'CAB PR LO DIFF' ECAM that cleared on its own after a few seconds. The Captain elected to land the aircraft since we had [priority] and we were overweight by about 5k lbs. We landed without incident and returned under our own power to the gate.
1893813,While ferrying my Cessna 182 with 14hrs on a factory new engine. I started the day departing ZZZ and stopped in ZZZ1 to refuel. After an uneventful flight from ZZZ1 I had about 45 minutes to my destination airport ZZZ2 around GPS waypoint ZZZZZ. While in cruise flight the Garmin GNS430W turned off suddenly. A lot of static became present in the radios. I made a few attempts to get back with Center while on VFR Flight Following on my second radios. Nothing was working as I was troubleshooting and I recognized that the Amps were '0'. Having lost an alternator in flight before I thought it was manageable and made final calls to Center to let them know I had lost comm's. At that point squawked XXXX; shut down all non essential electronics and proceeded on course to ZZZ2. About 10 to 12 minutes later I started to recognize erroneous fuel gauges bouncing and what appeared to be a faster rate of fuel burn. I watched this but was confident in my calculations and knew I had at least an hour and a half more fuel on board. Everything was fine but a short time later the fuel gauges were now showing completely empty. I was certain the engine was operating normally but was uneasy about the fuel gauges showing empty. I started to drift south and began a slight descent into ZZZ a suitable alternate given the situation. At this point I started to get EGT Temps rising. This was very apparent as I was monitoring with a brand new engine; etc. EGT continued to rise from the normal 1280 to 1340; 1400; 1500.. As it slowly continued to rise it was at the point it got to 1700 EGT; I nosed over several times to see if the temps would go down. As soon as I would level off the temps would continue to rise and I decided I am not crossing the town of ZZZ4 with these circumstances going on. I made the decision that it was time to get this aircraft on the ground immediately. I worried the exhaust could have a catastrophic failure and requested priority. I chose a suitable road to land on that I had been following most of the flight just to the south of me. With no observed traffic I made an uneventful landing on that road and pulled off on the side on a nice open flat surface completely off of the road. The first vehicle that drove up happened by chance to be the [town official]. With his help I checked all fluid levels and let the aircraft cool off. He was very helpful at coordinating with his local Sheriff; Fire; and Ranger. With all of their help we briefed a plan to reposition it to ZZZ and we hand propped a successful start and I did a full diagnostic to confirm temps were acceptable for the flight to the airport around the north part of town. The Sheriff and Ranger then blocked the road and I took off and quickly got it back down on the ground to assess it further with the help of a senior A&P. We assessed the plane and let it cool down again to ensure no damage would be done to the new engine. From there we made contact with the Tower at ZZZ3 and asked if I could land there for more assistance with [a local FBO]. The Tower allowed it and I made the short flight to ferry the plane to ZZZ3. About half way through the EGT spiked over 1800 but the A&P said keep my eyes off of that and on the CYL Head temps and I would be fine. Landed uneventful as per the plan and the plane is safe and being worked on at [FBO]. I was told it was the right decision and believe I made a well calculated decision after a cascade of negative possibilities started to happen. In the interest of preserving safety of flight; the town of ZZZ4; and the new engines integrity; I stand by the decision. I learned a lot from the event. So far the A&P's discovered a Bad Circuit Breaker/Bus; are updating some wiring and a battery; and are still fixing it up. They have taught me a lot about the redundancy and about problems that happen with electrical failures in flight. I hope this helps someone else learn from this.
1919149,Flight from ZZZ to ZZZZ. There was a large area of weather over [area] while the weather on the northern operation of the route was relatively clear. The logbook had multiple previous radar write ups with the most recent signed of on Date. When we got to cruise I turned on the radar and it failed. We tried cycling the off/on a number of times but it failed repeatedly. I noted that the WSI app showed we could keep clear of the weather by taking a more easterly route down the coast. I requested that route from ATC and asked the dispatcher to look at it and see if he thought we could stay clear of the weather on the new route. He was concerned about a segment of the route that had embedded thunderstorms so we elected to return to ZZZ for maintenance. We [requested priority handling] with Center and landed overweight. It was an uneventful approach and landing with a soft touchdown at 156;800 lbs. I wrote up the radar and overweight landing. We changed aircraft and proceeded to ZZZZ.I have high confidence in Maintenance. On this occasion the radar tested okay on the ground but failed airborne. I'm not sure what the technical issue was with the radar so I can't comment.
1880918,In climb mode; FMC VNAV speed stuck at Flaps 1 minimum speed with flaps selected to Zero and FLAPS INDICATOR was indicating ZERO. Above 10;000 ft.; we selected ECON CLIMB; the FMC VNAV CLIMB MODE was still stuck at Flaps 1 Minimum Speed. There is no QRH procedure for this situation. We attempted to contact Maintenance; but to no avail. So we contacted Dispatch and coordinated for an air return to ZZZ. Report was filed; and Maintenance Control was contacted. We swapped aircraft and departed for ZZZ1.
1873069,While flying [the] visual approach backed up by ILS35R MCO at 1600 feet MSL the glide slope failed to capture even though we had a good signal. We started down in V/S and at approximately 1400 feet MSL the glide slope captured. Approach and landing were normal after that point.Additionally; after turning off [the] runway; the Takeoff Warning Horn sounded twice when I attempted to add power to taxi. The warning then ceased.The radio altimeters appeared to display normally.Notified Dispatch and Maintenance.
1882754,On takeoff at approximately 90-100 knots; I felt a pressure bump and noticed the L Pack light on overhead. Captain called 'continue' and proceeded with a normal takeoff. After T/O we completed the L Bleed Off QRH checklist. When bleed did not reset; maintenance and dispatch were brought into the loop. ATC made the decision they wanted us to return to ZZZ for operational reasons. We dumped 53;700 lbs of fuel while preparing for our return to ZZZ. We consulted the Quick Reference Guide diversion guide and completed all checklists on arrival into ZZZ. A normal landing was accomplished and taxied to the gate uneventfully.
1917366,After push back we made a turnout of the ramp to spot. Ground instructed us to follow an aircraft from the right on Mike taxiway. We heard on the radio another flight report that a plane had an engine fire in the left engine. We had no indication in the cockpit of any fire so I wonder which aircraft that might be. The ground controller queried where the plane on fire was at. The other flight stated that the aircraft on fire was at spot 8 or 9. I immediately opened the cockpit window and leaned out and saw flames coming out of the rear of the left engine. I told the First Officer 'we are on fire'. I asked ground control to send the fire trucks to which he replied 'they are already on the way'. The First Officer got the QRC out and we ran the engine fire on the ground checklist. We ran the checklist to where I was supposed to discharge the fire bottles.We were in contact with crash fire rescue equipment at this point and they reported smoke; but no fire in the left engine. I did not discharge the bottle when crash fire rescue equipment reported no fire. We asked crash fire rescue equipment if they felt we could taxi back to the gate. Crash fire rescue equipment said they thought it was ok and said they would follow us back to the gate. We taxied back to the gate using the right engine and deplaned. I don't know when the fire actually started. They only way we knew was another aircraft telling ground we had a fire. After the fire was confirmed out; we tried to contact ZZZ Maintenance on the number two radio and received no response. (More on that later)Upon arriving at the gate; the Gate Agents opened the door and apparently just walked away. I was dealing with Ops and Maintenance and after a few minutes I noticed no one was deplaning. I asked the Flight Attendants what was going on and they stated the gate agent just opened the door and left. I walked up to the gate to find out what was going on. The two agents were at the counter and I asked why weren't the passengers deplaning. Their response was 'we opened the door; so why was everyone not getting off?' I said I thought the gate agents would have made some kind of announcement instructing the passenger what to do after deplaning. Or at the very least say something to the Flight Attendants so they could tell the passengers something. (Stay in the gate area; new gate; new departure time etc.) I did bring this up with the manager that later arrived and she said she would make note of that and review with her agents; 'so they could do better in the future'. I'm not sure who responsibility this really was; but I just thought they would have made some kind of announcement to the passengers after they opened the door. I didn't appreciate the ration of crap I received from the Maintenance Controller once we got to the gate and things calmed down. He admonished me that we need to contact Maintenance in situations like these as soon as possible. When I told him we tried and received no response; he proceeded to blame us for not answering the radio call. He stated; 'if you call on the #2 radio; it might as well be like you didn't call me at all'. It sounded like that was some sort of common knowledge or something. It was news to me since I am based in ZZZ and call maintenance 98% of the time on the #2 radio. I had a lot of things going on at the time and when maintenance didn't answer; I just moved on. I had crash fire rescue equipment on the #1 radio and never entertained switching off their frequency to call a much lower priority item like notifying the Maintenance Controller. I could just do that once we got back to the gate. They did get another aircraft for us and on the way I received a call from Chief Name. He asked if we were ok to continue. I checked with the First Officer and we both agreed we could continue on. 3 of the Flight Attendants got cold feet on the way to the other aircraft. It was now XX:00 PM and they were unable to find any replacements in a reasonable amount of time. The flight was rescheduled for XB:00 AM.
1928583,Captain was flying; during their approach brief; they briefed the pattern entry altitude. I can not remember the exact altitude they briefed; however their math was incorrect and it was less then the typical 1;500 ft. pattern altitude. I did not catch this. Neither of us noticed on pattern entry. We started to descend further on base; and we both noted how the terrain looked odd. We then got a 'Terrain Pull up' aural message and the Captain turned off the auto pilot and climbed to the correct pattern altitude and continued the approach and made a safe landing. We realized the mistake immediately.The biggest cause was the incorrect math on the pattern entry; which caused us to enter the pattern already low. Contributing factors included me (Pilot Monitoring (PM)) monitoring both CTAF and Center [frequency] because it was uncontrolled; it was a shorter flight; we were looking for traffic around the time we were briefing; TCAS wasn't functioning properly; I didn't catch his mistake in pattern altitude; and neither of us were familiar with the airport.Briefing during a low area of vulnerability so we can both pay more attention to the brief and catch mistakes early; and if its a shorter flight; briefing on the ground prior or asking for a delay vector to make more time.
1890509,Upon arrival at the gate; Flight Attendant (FA) notified me they detected an odor in the area of the aft jumpseats/galley during descent. One FA reported a burning sensation in her throat. The other (both seated in the aft jumpseats) reported feeling light headed and having a headache. They described it like 'an aerosol or ozone that you would experience in a hair salon'
1926627,The flight preparation was uneventful and as expected. The preflight walk-around and pre-flight checks were normal. The flight was uneventful before the EICAS message. Once the Amber EICAS message appeared we silenced the alert and the Pilot Flying (PF); Captain (CA) called for the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). We both pulled out the QRH and I Pilot Monitoring (PM) read the QRH. The two-step checklist called for a cycle of the parking brake lever and to ensure it was correctly stowed after the cycle process. Once this was accomplished the alert did not immediately go away. The note below step one warns of a possible tire bursting on landing if the EICAS message does not go away. We proceeded to step two; which calls for a full flap landing. We prepared the numbers for a full flap landing and completed the checklist. Then the PM/First Officer (FO) looked through AOM 1 (Aircraft Operating Manual) and AOM 2 for any additional information on our braking and tires that could affect our landing or cause the situation. Nothing of note was found and within ten minutes the EICAS message went away. We proceeded with the full flap landing and did inform the Flight Attendants of the situation. However; both PF/Captain and the FO/PM agreed that since the message did go away; and that we had no other indication of the brakes being set we did not anticipate any issue and the EICAS message was an erroneous message. We landed in ZZZ1 with no issue. We did inform the next crew of what happened and me and the other Captain agreed since the message went away the next crew would take the plane to ZZZ2. Maintenance was not called. Before leaving ZZZ1 after a two-hour sit I received a call from maintenance control that the next crew had the same issue in flight that we did and [requested priority handling] into ZZZ2. From my experiences in the past; when maintenance control is called for a situation that happened in flight that went away; even with the running of a QRH checklist I've told not to write it up as the issue was no longer occurring. It is each Pilot in Command's (PIC's) responsibility to take all the information they are given and decide about the airworthiness and safety of their airplane. I decided it was not a maintenance issue since safety was never compromised and the message went away and the airplane landed normally; and everything was normal with the brakes. We did inform the next crew so they could make their own decision on their aircraft. They chose to go with the information given. The suggestion is more for me as PIC; I learned from this situation and next time I will call maintenance control and let them decide and not rely on previous experiences so from now on I will call.
1879269,During descent into ZZZ through about 12;000 ft.; we experienced the entire aircraft shudder aggressively; several display units went dark; the autopilot disengaged; and also a slew of amber EICAS messages displayed. The left engine generator had failed. The Captain called for the QRH and it was run by both our Company pilot jump seaters who are captains. I maintained the radios and backed up the Captain who was hand-flying. The checklist called for one reset of the left GEN CONT switch. When the switch was pressed; the aircraft shuddered again during the power transfer and the generator immediately tripped again. The APU was started and came online to give us a second electrical source. The autopilot was re-engaged and we landed normally on XXL at ZZZ.
1891526,We were cleared to push straight back from Gate X and then Aircraft Y; a 787; was cleared to push from Gate Y. We were pushed tail to tail with a wind of 20 knots from around 130 degrees giving the 787 a right quartering headwind. We started without knowing the position of the 787 and called for taxi. We were told to hold. The 787 started and his exhaust was injected by our engines and filled the entire aircraft with fumes. By the time we realized this; it was too late to turn off our packs. I asked ramp to taxi around to the south line to get out of the fumes but was informed that I would not be allowed until the 787 push crew was disconnected. I informed ramp of the fume event and was told that this is the way they do it; and I would have to wait. The total disregard from ramp was a big factor. We could have moved at minimal power; or the priority of push could have been established before pushing and one of us could have waited at the gate.Pushing tail to tail is not safe and should not be continued especially with a strong wind from a starting aircraft. Ramp should be able to use good judgement in these situations; and should listen to crew concerns.
1888374,After full-power climb; leveled off at 7;500 ft. MSL. Left throttle full open (22'MP) and pulled propeller back to 2;100 RPM. Noticed that all engine exhaust temperatures dropped to less than 1000 F and all cylinder head temperatures were dropping rapidly. Checked fuel flow and noted that it was excessive at 17-18 GPH (should have been 11-12GPH). Leaned the engine to approx. 1;300 Degrees F exhaust gas temperatures; noting the mixture control worked to lean the engine. I did not put mixture to full rich for landing since full-rich mixture was excessive and would result in a loss of power; rather; I set EGTs to about 1;100 degrees F. After landing; engine was able to be shut down by taking mixture to idle cutoff. Diagnosis by mechanic is that the fuel servo is not metering correctly.
1935834,I am a Flight Instructor FBO out of ZZZ1. We were conducting training out of our Cessna 172 Lima model. We were doing a routine practice flight followed by landings at ZZZ. We made a radio call roughly 7 miles out from the southeast that we were coming in for the left downwind of Runway XX. We were aware that the winds were not favoring that runway but because there were traffic already landing on XX; we decided to follow them in and re-asses the situation after we land. Roughly 60 seconds after making our radio call; we observed an airplane 800 ft. below us; coming in the opposite direction. At that time he seemed to be flying parallel with us. Upon him coming close to being abeam our left wing; the traffic suddenly made a sharp left turn unannounced and started ascending towards us. I made a split second decision to take evasive action and turn right and start a climb immediately. Thankfully he seemed to have passed less than 200 ft. and 100 ft. below us. I immediately asked on the radio if that traffic was on the frequency of ZZZ- and got no response after 3 attempts. We later proceeded to safely make a landing. After we taxied back to the runway; we observed that the same traffic was on an extended final practicing some sort of an ILS XX into ZZZ. We talked to him on the radio and he stated that 1. He did not hear us make the radio call which we definitely did. 2. He had us visual the entire time. I do not understand why if someone had us visual that they would turn direct towards us and would not listen out for radio calls in such a busy uncontrolled airport. His tail number is Aircraft Y - a twin piper Seminole. This is my first time making a report. I am currently a CFI/I and have been flying for the last 5 years. I am saying with full confidence this is the closest mid-air collision I have ever encountered and to see the negligence from the other aircraft is mind-blowing. For him to come out on ATC and state that he never heard us or had us visual the entire time made me confused even more. I am more than happy to provide more information and hope that proper action is taken. This is absolutely unacceptable.
1879077,During cruise flight; we received an L HYDRAULIC SYSTEM PRESSURE and RUDDER RATIO EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System). We executed the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) procedure 3.1.5.Due to the checklist including the apparent possibility of losing further system pressure or quantity and more system degradation; we opted to requested priority handling with ATC and have the emergency crews standing by. We got direct routing to ZZZ1 and landed without further incident. Probable failure of the engine driven hydraulic pump.
1868527,Today on Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1 we experienced a hydraulic system 3 low pressure warning shortly after getting vectored onto the final approach course for ILS Runway XX in VMC conditions. We saw the caution message and checked the hydraulic synoptic page to see that there was no fluid left in our hydraulic 3 system; but there was pressure in the line. We asked for delay vectors and discontinued our approach to run the QRH. After running the QRH we got to the gear extension portion and after talking it through decided to drop the gear using the conventional method. The gear went down and locked 3 green; however the pressure was completely depleted in system 3 after that. We decided to pull the manual gear extension in case the reading was faulty as advised by the QRH. We ran the rest of the QRH procedure and [requested priority handling] with the Tower. After all checklists were run we were vectored back onto the approach. I was the FO was flying during the checklist and procedure. After the procedure was completed we decided that the Captain should land the aircraft and we transferred the controls to his side and I took over the job of pilot monitoring. We landed the plane safely and let ATC know that we would not be able to exit the runway. ARFF was standing by to inspect the aircraft for leaks and none were found. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance via ACARS while on the ground and informed them of the situation. Once inspected by ARFF a tug towed us into the gate.Not sure what the cause was; there were no other indications during flight that caused alarm until close to the airport when we received the caution message.
1921632,We were scheduled to take passengers out of EGE. The initial clearance we received on the ground was to depart Runway 25 and climb via the BEVVR 1 departure RUBAY transition; the top altitude of which is 15;000 ft. We briefed our plan A and B; and the Captain made special emphasis on cleaning up the aircraft at 7;000 ft. (slightly above our normal level off altitude of 400 feet). We took off Runway 25 and made the turn to COPER. During the climb I was slightly late (about 50 feet) on making the 7;000 foot call out; so the Captain called it out and we cleaned up the aircraft. Around 8;300 feet; Tower called and advised us to maintain 10;000 feet; contact Center. I don't remember if it was Tower or Center; after checking in with them that told us to expect higher shortly. I set the altitude selector to 10;000 ft.; called out '10;000 set and 9;000 climbing 10;000.' Looking back I don't remember if the Captain acknowledged my call outs as required by our SOPs. This should have been an indication to me to verify the altitude with him again and to check with Tower to confirm the instructions. I called Center and advised that we were '9;000 climbing 10;000.' We had the TAWS page up prior to take off and we could see the terrain visually. We were in the black the whole time and didn't received any sort of TAWS alert. We leveled off at 10;000 and maintained the speeds required by the departure while we waited for a higher altitude as we had been previously advised. Between BEVVR and APRES we received a low altitude alert from Center and were cleared to FL260. Center advised us that the MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude) in that area was 13;100 ft. and told us that there was a required climb gradient on the SID for a reason. We of course began our climb to FL260; advised Center that we had been assigned 10;000 ft. and asked them to mark the tapes and provide us with a phone number so we could call once we reached our destination. I still don't know if the Tower Controller had misspoke or if I had misheard the altitude instruction; but a lapse of communication took place somewhere. I should have questioned the unusual altitude assignment with the controller and verified that the Captain heard the same instructions as I had.
1921212,On arrival into ZZZ the Approach Controller vectored us off the arrival and gave us an intercept heading for the Runway XXR localizer kept us at 6;000 ft. which felt too high. We were then slowed by ATC from 230kts to 210kts then to 190kts. As we got closer to the localizer I mentioned to the CA (Captain) that the controller was keeping us high; we gave the controller a short time before requesting lower and were given 4;000 ft.; then shortly after reading it back we were given 3;000 ft.; the controller seemed a bit confused. throughout the descent I configured for the slow speed and descent by putting flaps out and lowering the landing gear (flaps 5 and gear down) at this point we were flying through the localizer and the CA questioned the controller; we were now at about 5;000 ft. and descending to 3;000 ft.; we received a traffic alert and told the controller and then received an RA; I immediately disengaged the A/T (autothrottles) and A/P (autopilot) and followed RA commands for a descent and was then given an immediate heading of 250 from ATC (this instruction from ATC came from a different voice on the same frequency; seemingly a different controller or a supervisor who stepped in). Then I watched as the traffic passed overhead and slightly in front; I would estimate they passed by within 500 ft. After the aircraft passed left to right the controller called out the traffic to us which was obviously much too late. Also; once the traffic passed by we received the 'clear of conflict' from the TCAS system and from here ATC gave us a turn and we're cleared for the visual to Runway XXR and the rest of the flight was uneventful. The approach controller seemed to be behind and possibly not seeing the full picture. We noticed this initially when we were left at 6;000 ft. while approaching the localizer with no descent clearance. We prompted approach who then gave us lower; 4;000 ft.; immediately after repeating the altitude the controller gave us 3;000 ft.; this was odd and seemed like they finally realized how high they had left us. The supervising approach controller should have step in and taken over much earlier to avoid this situation.
1894923,During an interview with an FAA representative concerning an Occurrence Report; the FAA representative indicated that the maintenance log may not have been properly filled out. Specifically; a box labeled 'P/R' was not checked.The interview was in reference to an event which occurred on Date1 wherein the flight crew performed an emergency descent and landing. The descent and landing was in response to an EICAS message: 'CABIN ALTITUDE HI'.For that incident; the following narrative was submitted in a Report on Date2: 'During climb to cruising altitude of FL310; (enroute from ZZZ to ZZZ1); the EICAS indicated 'CABIN ALTITUDE HI' at approximately FL 270. The Crew performed duties in accordance with the emergency procedures checklist and QRH. Flight deck crew Reported the warning to ATC; informed Dispatch and determined to land immediately at the nearest airport; ZZZ2. No-one was injured during the incident. Maintenance cleared the aircraft for service and the flight proceeded to the scheduled airport; ZZZ1.'This report is in response to to the possibility; indicated by Name (The FAA representative) that a box in the maintenance log may have been inadvertently left unchecked prior to the aircraft being returned to service for continuation to the originally planned destination; ZZZ1.I was asked if I had verified the maintenance log and noticed that the box was not checked. I responded that I verified the signature of the Maintenance representative. I also indicated that I did not recall if a box was left unchecked. However; I received and reviewed the Dispatch Release which indicated that Maintenance had cleared the aircraft to return to service.Name suggested that returning to ZZZ; was a viable option. I indicated that it was ATC who suggested that we divert to ZZZ2 as it was the closest airport. In fact; ZZZ2 was so close that I had a very short time to update the FMS with the new destination and set the landing conditions.  The FO (First Officer) tried to assist with the FMS entries and I found it necessary to remind him that his primary duties were to fly the aircraft; and that standard operating procedures prescribed that the Pilot Monitoring; myself; to set up the FMS.I will discuss this with the training department and the maintenance department and make a habit of asking maintenance representatives to double-check for completion of the maintenance log.
1883542,FAR 117 and Company policies are inadequate to ensure proper rest opportunities. A 10-hour minimum rest; allowing 30 minutes for round trip transportation and 8 hours of sleep opportunity; a mere 90 minutes of rest remains to check in to the hotel; eat; exercise; prepare for sleep; allow for hygiene; and prepare for the new work day. Often; set hotel transportation schedules further eat into the 90 minutes of 'personal time.' Ninety minutes is insufficient after a sometimes 16+ hour day to achieve adequate rest. Furthermore; Company's reliance on early morning departures often requires attempting to sleep as early as 6 PM body clock time to attempt 8 hours of sleep. Proper hygiene; exercise; nutrition; and rest are important for personal health; even more so during a pandemic.Company relies solely on legal minimums; without opportunity to mitigate fatigue. A Pilot's only option is to declare fatigue and return to rest. A fatigue call should be an anomaly; used when unusual events occur; not the only mechanism in place for a Pilot abused by Company Scheduling practices; to ensure safe operations of flight. Contractual compliance is more of a guideline for Company. They seem to be reactionary; rather than proactively complying with the fatigue mitigation requirements limiting duty day.Flight duty app does a poor job of ensuring legal and contractual compliance. It seems as though there is a 'set it and forget it' approach. Once assigned; it is the Pilot's responsibility to ensure compliance; rather than it being a shared responsibility. Flight duty app's continued rerouting of Crews; affected by other operational difficulties; subjects additional Crews to long days; short nights while creating further operational challenges of displaced Crews.Company provides fatigue mitigation training through distance learning modules. There is no opportunity to implement mitigation strategies when Company Scheduling response to questioning the efficiency or efficacy of a reassignment is; 'But it's legal.' Company needs to do better than reaching for the bare minimum when it comes to something as paramount to Flight Safety; as Crew Member fatigue.FAR 117 needs to be improved to adequately address fatigue concerns. Both [military branch X] and [military branch Y] require 12 hours of off-duty time to allow for transportation; nutrition; exercise; hygiene; and rest. Ten hours is insufficient to allow for each of these necessary part of healthy human existence. Company needs to treat its Crew Members as people; not machines. Repetitive long days and short nights increases risk. A Pilot overestimating his/her condition and ability increases risk. Mitigation strategies need to be emphasized rather than relying on a fatigue call as the only mechanism to repair Company's inefficient scheduling practices
1872703,FMS/FMC/Autopilot Failure. I looked at the instrumentation to confirm glide slope intercept and immediately recognized that we were descending early. I went to announce it to the CA (Captain) (Pilot Flying) who also recognized the situation at the same time. The aircraft was on autopilot; flying level; with VOR/LOC activated after being cleared for the approach into ZZZ. The aircraft; without being prompted; began to descend before intercepting glide slope at some point. The Captain instantly disconnected the autopilot and auto throttles; initiating a full power climb back to the intercept altitude. We received a call from ATC and received a minor GPWS warning as we were climbing. I feel that crew coordination; confirmation of what the aircraft was supposed to be doing and the reaction by the Pilot Flying (CA) were proper and allowed us to detect the situation early on. Because it was an automation failure; the aircraft will be written up for maintenance.
1929979,I was preparing for an ocean crossing in ZZZZ when the FA (Flight Attendant) and Gate Agent presented me with a decision to make regarding a battery powered device the passenger claimed was a disability assistive device. There was piece of paper from the manufacturer in Czech Republic stating that. The battery compartment was inaccessible and could not determine what type of battery or the strength of it. You could not read the plaque. I called a company representative for support in making the decision. We concurred that the device should not travel. I told that to the Gate Agent. When we arrived in ZZZ I saw the device laying on the jetway. This device should never have made it past the ticket counter. It does not meet the definitions in the FOM and the language in those manuals is confusing.
1935049,Pilot selected landing gear up. Green lights went out and gear sounded and felt like it cycled up but hydraulic pump continued to run and gear handle light continued to flash orange. Pilot selected gear down; slowed aircraft; and gear cycled down. Pilot again selected gear up; and gear; again appeared to cycle up normally but pump continued to run and gear handle light continued to flash. Pilot selected gear down and got only Left Main gear light; Red Gear Unsafe light and Gear Unsafe CAS message.  Pilot began to run [priority] gear extension checklist. Gear cycled down and three green lights were observed. Pressing Gear Down Check caused gear lights to flash green. Aircraft landed without further event and was turned over to maintenance. Aircraft has been repaired twice in last month for similar issue by two different service centers; each of which effected repairs and signed aircraft off as airworthy.
1922395,On [date] at approximately XA:50pm local; I had an incident that resulted in a propeller strike in Aircraft X. I had just completed the second and final jump run for the afternoon with one parachute exiting the aircraft. I started a descent south of our home airfield; ZZZ and setup for a long final to Runway XX. On my previous landing; I practiced a no-flap landing. I decided to perform a full-flap landing to contrast the two. I approached to land Runway XX on speed and made contact with the Runway within the first 1000 ft. As I touched down; a gust of wind from the left caught and raised the left wing so that only the right landing gear was in contact with the surface of the Runway. I applied right rudder and brake as I perceived the aircraft left of centerline and at risk of departing the Runway without correction. As I applied right brake; the nose came down and the propeller struck the surface of the Runway. The airplane settled onto both mains and the nosewheel while still on the surface of Runway XX. I taxied off of Runway XX and shutdown the engine to inspect the damage.
1905852,On departure at FL240; had HYD G RSVR LO LVL ECAM message followed by associated low pressure and other hydraulic messages. Completed ECAM actions and follow ups. Requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ for overweight landing on Runway XXR. Gravity gear extension required. Landed 24;900 pounds overweight. Uneventful landing and cleared the runway. After ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) inspected aircraft; taxied to the gate. There were no causal factors; just mechanical failure. As this incident was caused by mechanical failure; there is nothing I can suggest that would prevent this type of event from occurring in the future. However; it is worth noting that due to good policies; procedures and crew coordination; the event was handled in a superior manner.
1873009,Descending through 4;000 ft. the Captain and I smelled a 'dirty socks' smell in the flight deck; but there was also a slight chemical smell to it. I began to feel a tingling sensation in my hands and so I donned my oxygen mask. I was leveling at 3;000 ft. and turning base to final to land on the ILS for XXL. While on oxygen; I felt fit to continue to flying the aircraft and landed normally. I stayed on oxygen until engine shutdown at the Gate. The smell continued on the taxi and lingered after engine shutdown. The Flight Attendants could not smell the odor in the cabin. After I left the aircraft; while walking up the jet bridge my hands; feet; and lips continued to feel tingly and I had a light headed sensation. I elected to go to the ER where my bloodwork confirmed my carbon monoxide levels were slightly elevated. I believe that the fume problem was caused by engine oil contaminants in the bleed air system. However; maintenance could not duplicate the issue and the airplane was returned to service. This type of fume incident is not uncommon throughout the industry and needs to be reported on FAA Service Difficulty Reports to ensure that the industry and manufactures improve the filtration systems on aircraft; install carbon monoxide or other sensors to detect air quality issues; and to develop standardized protocols for physicians to follow when crew members encounter fume events. The health of crew members and the safety of flight is impacted by these fume events and it needs to be corrected.
1882377,Upon arriving to the terminal area from the southeast we were instructed to enter a left downwind 17R from about 15 miles out and then asked by tower to confirm instructions when closer. We continued to 17R and cleared to land at least 10 (miles) out. After entering the runway environment as instructed we flew a snug pattern almost directly over the west parallel. While rolling in to final at low level in full landing configuration we were then instructed to extend our downwind and the landing clearance was canceled. That was an extremely late call to do that action as we were lined up on 17R on a slight angle to final at that time. Not knowing what the issue was and the student not taking action I assumed flying and took the aircraft. I immediately executed a climb then rolled right to a northern direction then needed to take evasive action because of the head on with an airliner in my front windscreen. This was an extremely near miss and extremely late call by the tower to take any kind of action. Arrival time in the terminal area was about XA30 as my notes on landing time are missing. I am sure you can look it up and be much closer.If we were allowed to continue we would have been clear of the runway with plenty of time to allow the following aircraft to land with no issues. The other resolution would have been when we were still actually on downwind to have been given instructions to continue until base was called. Neither of us in the aircraft had a visual on the airliner until we were taking evasive action. We were never advised by tower that there was another aircraft on final all thought we did hear approach talking to others. This action of making an extremely aggressive maneuver could have been avoided as it turned out to be extremely dangerous for us at low level and steep angles while slow to avoid the other aircraft. I would clarify this as a serious incident.
1921728,Event Description:On Day at XA:50Z a near miss occurred between a Piper PA-25 Comanche and a Gravity Defiant Paramotor (Ultralight).  The incident occurred 2.7 NM west of ZZZ; about 4 min prior to sunset.  The ultralight was on a heading of 104 at 46 mph approaching ZZZ at a GPS altitude of 820 feet; when the PA-25 overflew the centerline of the ultralight from directly astern at a GPS altitude of 975 feet.  The separation at the closest point of approach was 155 feet; with a closing velocity of 120 mph; based on review of ADS-B data.  The PA-25 was not maneuvering prior to the merge nor after the merge implying that the PA-25 pilot did not see the ultralight.  Immediately after the merge the ultralight made a diving right hand turn losing 400 feet of altitude and developing lateral separation from the PA-25's flight path in order to clear the wake turbulence; before returning to stable flight and landing at ZZZ.Contributing Factors:-The PA-25 pilot was heads down at the time of the incident and did not 'see and avoid'-It was about 4 min prior to sunset-The ultralight has a blind spot to the rear of the aircraft-The ultralight's wing is predominantly black with neon green and white striping-The ultralight does not have ADS-B-The ultralight was not on CTAF/UNICOM at the time of the incident-During maintenance on the ultralight the day prior; the two strobes located on opposing sides of the ultralight were removed.  They were not re-installed prior to flight.  The SOP for strobe usage is to turn the strobes on 30 min prior to sunset or when in the vicinity of ZZZ.
1929502,Taxing for takeoff; main cargo fire indication (EICAS); Fire Master Warning light with fire bell.  Set the parking brake. Called ATC ground frequency and told them Main cargo fire; requested Fire trucks to our location; abeam parking spot X. Accomplished checklists and evacuated the aircraft using the escape reels through the crew entry door. No visible smoke in the cockpit area. Successful evacuation with no injuries.
1871974,I was doing a [flight] in south Florida and had a mid air collision with an unknown object. The [flight] was our shortest and has X legs airport to beach; shoreline and then back to airport. While flying offshore flying on the shoreline leg while around 300 ft. I collided with something which at first I thought was a bird but upon later inspection on the ground; I believe it to be a drone. I was unable to see the object since it came from below and was out of my field of view. Upon impact I made sure there were no adverse affects to the aircraft before landing as soon as practical back at the airport of departure. A big factor in this collision was flying low level close to the shore over the water. Drones and helicopters have rights to be in the same airspace under certain conditions and where I was it was legal for them to be there but for me as well. A corrective action for me would be to be mindful that drones could be up to 400 ft. legally and to not fly as low over the shoreline any more.
1917348,Shortly after takeoff at approximately 800 ft altitude; the left engine indicated an over temperature. As pilot flying; I completed the memory items and retarded the left thrust lever to get the engine back into limits. This resulted in about a 20% reduction in thrust. We climbed to 6;000 ft and completed the QRC checklist. Upon level off; I engaged the A/P and transferred flying duties to the First Officer; F/O. I relayed to ATC that a return to ZZZ was likely; but needed time to confer with Dispatch. I established comms with Dispatch and Maintenance; and it was decided to return to ZZZ. The F/O and I completed all required checklists and an uneventful landing ensued on Runway XXL. Upon landing rollout; firefighting personnel checked the brake temp. It was within limits and we taxied back to the gate. Overall a very uneventful event.
1895324,On climb we saw the cabin rate start to increase above 10K. We heard the aural warning and red indication on the cabin alt section of the EICAS. We ran QRH and selected manual mode. Changes in manual mode were not making a difference. Most changes by the cabin rate were made by power adjustments. For that reason; we diverted back to the field.
1874118,While on an ILS 4R into EWR; I was the Captain; pilot flying. The EWR weather was 800 broken with light rain. Right at the cloud base; I lost my flight director; ILS raw data (including standy att); and VNAV PDI info. First Officer instrumentation remained normal. I maintained attitude and broke out in a few seconds low and right of course. (We received a low altitude warning from ATC). We had a normal landing. I wrote up all unusual indications and did a follow up call to Maintenance Control the following day.
1892854,I am a student pilot and was out on a traffic pattern solo. During my second lap around the traffic pattern; as I was on base for Runway XX; a yellow high wing airplane flew underneath my own plane on final for the same runway. I did see and avoid the other plane before any further issues occurred. The yellow airplane was not on the radio frequency for the airport and never made any radio calls announcing their position or intentions. Technically no radio is needed to enter the uncontrolled airport; but the manner they landed in; straight in and low; was unnecessarily dangerous.
1900196,Odor event happened during pushback. FA1 (Flight Attendant) called flight deck while we were pushing back to report passenger in 2D complained of unusual odor and FA1 confirmed the smell from the area of rows 2-4. In the flight deck we did not smell anything unusual. I informed FA1 that I would need to get back to her in a minute while I communicated with Push Crew to hold the push and stay connected while I investigate the odor report. I asked the Push Crew if they could see or smell anything unusual that might have caused FA1 to notice. From the Ground Crew there was nothing unusual. The aircraft was safely stopped and brakes set and I called back to FA1 to get update and investigate what was happening. The update from FA1 was unusual smell persisted. To investigate; I inquired about the oven possibly being the cause due to it was on earlier while at the gate to heat food. FA1 indicated a familiarity with that type of oven smell and was not the possible cause. Next asked about potential causes from overhead bin spill or passenger; but neither could be judged as the cause. FA1 indicated enough concern about the odor and unknown source to judge this an Odor Event and follow procedures. Coordinated return to the gate and informed Dispatch over ACARS; Operations and Maintenance over company radio. Referenced FOM Aircraft Smoke; Odor or Fumes; accomplished all the steps. I emphasized to my crew the duty to perform a self assessment and seek medical attention if needed. My PA included request for passenger self assessment/medical attention. I was later informed that FA1 and FA3 did seek medical. The entire event from push to block-in was 17 minutes.I could not smell anything so I was solely relying on reports from FA1 and the cabin crew. I suspect it was from the oven being used at the gate earlier. Perhaps the oven smell is quite different while it cools off on the ground; compared to how the smell is perceived during cruise. It could be the way cabin airflow subtly changed after the cabin door was shut for pushback; altering the perception of normal oven operation.Check how long it takes for an oven to cool off after use. The fans in the oven run after it is off and that time information could help alleviate any concerns about unusual odors during that time.
1899621,Vectored aircraft into airspace normally controlled by Approach Control towards final approach that is normally controlled by same approach control. Accidentally issued altitude clearance 1;000 ft. below MIA. Caught too late; aircraft descend to 145 ft. in 150 ft. then immediately entered 130 ft. Refresh MIA knowledge in airspace that is infrequently used.
1898391,Destination showed 0 SM in ATIS while enroute. Crew informed me that they were planning to set up for a CAT II approach. At this point I rechecked all NOTAMs and saw the 5G NOTAM. I looked at the release and saw that there was a remark that ZZZ AMOC (Alternative Method of Compliance) was approved for Runway XXL. I messaged the crew to tell them that I showed we could only do CAT II on XXL. They responded 'that's what we are seeing also'. A few minutes later I decided to check the AMOC just to be sure. The latest version I had was not searchable and was alphabetical by airport name; not identifier so when I didn't see ZZZ as I expected I would because of the release remarks; I immediately emailed the duty managers and asked for a searchable document in case the airport name was different or I was missing something. I was sent an Excel document and ZZZ was not in it so I immediately sent a message to the crew that the remarks on the release were incorrect and we could not do a CAT II approach to any runway in ZZZ. At this time they were on final approach. They were able to land and I became curious about what their 5G uplink from Company had told them about which runways were in the AMOC. I looked in the ACARs traffic log and saw it told them 'RWY XXL 5G NOTAM IN EFFECT. SOP 5G POLICIES APPLY. RWY XXR 5G NOTAM IN EFFECT. SOP 5G POLICIES APPLY.' I referenced memo number X which told me this message meant 'All runways requested are NOT on the AMOC and FOM/SOP 5G restrictions apply'. This told me that their 5G uplink from Company matched the AMOC but the remark on the release did not. I immediately emailed the duty managers and informed the other dispatchers of the discrepancy. The CA (Captain) called me after the flight and I apologized that the automated release remark was wrong but mentioned that I saw the 5G uplink message was correct. The CA said that he thought the 5G uplink was just telling him that there WAS a 5G NOTAM not that he couldn't do a CAT II to those runways. I agreed that I found the wording of the uplink confusing too but referred him to the memo that explained the meaning of the various messages. I asked him if he ended up shooting the CAT II approach and he said he did not. I decided to file a report because the automated remark on my release was incorrect and I told the CA we were AMOC approved for that runway based on it before I verified it in the AMOC. The incorrect remark combined with the Captain's confusion about the meaning of the 5G uplink message created a situation where we nearly shot a CAT II approach to a runway that could have had 5G interference.The process we use involving release remarks to identify AMOC runways continues to fail us. I have emails showing that every time we have gotten a new AMOC the release remarks have been found to be incorrect for one or more airports. Last month this was not discovered until 20 days into the revised AMOC. On many occasions the subsequent AMOCs are removing runways; giving us further limitations to operations so it's definitely a safety concern when they are not updated. I would personally rather not have a remark on there at all than have the information be incorrect so maybe we should remove the remarks completely since our administrators cannot manage to keep them up to date. The process to needs to be fully audited; changes made to ensure compliance; and continually spot-checked.
1893179,On Date Aircraft X had an open write up for an ADC issue. The PM shift began troubleshooting the problem with Maintenance and performed a task a certain way thinking that it wouldn't be RII since they were not opening both systems at the same time per the RII list. With contract having no success after the re-rack one side at a time which wasn't documented in the logbook and only listed in a turnover; the RII was missed. A ZZZ road trip was set up prior to my arrival with limited parts and tooling. The mechanics that were sent already had an idea of what needed accomplished and had the required references needed in the event; so when they arrived at the aircraft they went to work immediately.The mechanics had a few issues during ops and leak checks and reached out to another base for some direction per my request. Shortly after; the checks began going smoothly and knowing the checks a quite lengthy I let them work with little to no interruptions only for a fatigue check. Around XA:00 they stated that the write up should be signed off within the hour pending the results of the final function check that was required; then would have to remove all the test equipment and complete the paperwork; while requesting to be put on the first flight out back to ZZZ which was the aircraft they were fixing. I had asked that a member of morning shift get that process started since I was going to be off shift when they were supposed to depart. As XB:00 approached; operations and dispatch were asking for a RTS update along with a rush to try and get the mechanics checked in on the flight since it an hour prior cut off; all while not knowing where the mechanics stood close out and clean up wise. At XB:15 the mechanics finally uploaded a photo of the completed logbook; while I was in the middle of typing my turnover to the morning shift for them to take over; with the flight due out shortly I checked the verbiage they entered and verified the references they listed then began entering all the information in to the maintenance systems trying to keep the flight on time looking over the 'no' circled under RII when in fact it is RII. The aircraft was released for flight but aborted takeoff due to not having any air speed indication even though the air speed checked fine during the function check. The aircraft RTG and another road trip was set up after I had gone home for the day.Always document all work completed on the aircraft and verify the work done is cross checked with the RII list. Also don't rush paperwork to try and save the right start. Not creating a discrepancy for troubleshooting causing a missed RII with contract maintenance and rushing over paperwork at shift end to not cause a maintenance delay.
1899785,I'm writing this to help identify and explain a possible misunderstanding with ATC. On take-off roll just prior to v1 the aircraft pulled hard left then immediately corrected to center line. We continued and took off uneventful. Prior to being handed off departure I quarried if there were debris on the runway. I was thinking to use all resources to rule out a possible tire failure. The Tower seemed as though we were trying to report an issue without saying it. We were not and we made that clear. Over to departure and departure asked us if we have an issue because Tower called them. We had time to talk about the situation and the Captain who was flying said he thought it was a possible large wind gust and I agreed after ruling out tire and steering issues. Satisfied we reported no issues and everything was normal. They checked again and we said all is normal. We continued the rest of the flight without issues.
1913764,The SIC (Second in Command) loaded a large amount of baggage/luggage with the help of line service prior to departure . While unloading the luggage/baggage after arrival; I came across a carrying case. After further examination it appeared that it contained a scooter. I found the passenger and asked if it was an electric scooter and was told yes. With the amount of baggage the passengers had and that the scooter was in a carrying case it was loaded without being detected as an electric scooter. Told passengers that we are not allowed to carry electric scooters and notified the company. Monitor the loading of baggage and challenge passengers as to the contents inside.
1917537,Our concern here in the Tehachapi Valley are the two airports close together with traffic patterns that have been known to conflict with each other. TSP Tehachapi Muni has a South side Pattern and Mountain Valley Airport a Northern pattern. The airports are 2 miles apart. The traffic pattern for TSP is on its south side over the city; schools etc. When there is plenty of room to fly a north pattern; which is mostly over cow pastures. However the city; the sponsor; has interests in much development of the north side; and knows the Kern County ALUCP (Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan) would curtail such if pattern was moved to north side. We had a stall spin accident into a town building in the past. Pilot killed but luckily no fire. I also have information from one of the sailplane tow pilots from the other airport; Mountain Valley; L94 addressing his many encounters with aircraft in the pattern at TSP. Pilots here have had no interest for this problem from the City of Tehachapi; we would like the FAA to look into this safety concern.
1926111,When departing CRW yesterday; we were instructed to taxi to Runway 5 on Taxiway A and hold short. While holding short of the runway; I noticed the taxiway location sign to our left read 'A1 5 - 23'. Looking at my airport diagram in chart software; it shows Taxiway A1 is all the way on the north east side of the airport for aircraft holding short of Runway 23. We were in the correct spot and followed our ATC assigned instructions but I feel this mislabeled sign could cause confusion for other flight crews. Reviewing the NOTAMs for CRW; there is no mention on non-standard taxiway signage. The taxiway sign for Taxiway A while holding short of Runway 5 needs to be updated.
1880207,I was scheduled to fly from ZZZ to ZZZ1 with Captain. Before the flight we discussed MEL and I verified that the E2 thrust reverser locking pin was in place; but due to a lack of clarity with the MEL; Aircraft X may have flown with both thrust reversers locked. Upon arrival in ZZZ1 I was scheduled to fly a ZZZ2 turn with Captain in the same aircraft. After doing the post flight walk around; I questioned Captain about both thrust reversers being locked and after reviewing the MEL he explained to me that at least one thrust reverser is required for dispatch so we then notified Maintenance Control and Operations.Due to lack of experience with MELs; and the inconspicuous color of the thrust reverser locking pins; Aircraft X may have flown with both thrust reversers locked even though the MEL states that one thrust reverser is required for dispatch.Despite discussing the MEL and the locking pins with both Captains; the thrust reverser locking pins that were installed on the aircraft were recessed from outer surface of the engine and were an inconspicuous color of a plain bolt or pin. Based on my training; I expected the thrust reverse locking pins to be a high visibility color such as red or yellow; however they were not. The incorrect configuration of the aircraft may have been noticed before we flew the aircraft if the thrust reverser locking pins were a highly conspicuous color.
1902842,We operated from ZZZ1 to ZZZZ. The descent into ZZZZ was uneventful. The FO was PF and I was PM. The FO had called for flaps 1 and then flaps 5 as we prepared for the turn inbound on final. The FO called for flaps 10. At the same time we got a FLAPS DRIVE EICAS message. The FO called for the FLAPS DRIVE checklist. The FO in the observers seat asked if we wanted to break off the approach to run the checklist. I responded that I thought the checklist was short and no real change to procedures with it. I think I said if it looks long we would break off. I ran the checklist and found I was correct. The checklist does not take long to run. We adjusted the ref speed for the approach and continued. I asked everyone if they were okay with what we had done. Everyone answered yes. The FO in the observes seat said he had read through the checklist again and all was done. I elected not to request priority with ZZZZ Tower. As I thought about it later I probably should have. I did inform them that we would be coming in at a faster than normal approach speed. I told them approach speed would be 183 knots. The other thing I failed to do was have landing numbers run for the flaps drive failure. I completely forgot that the landing performance page had the non-normals section. No one else mentioned it either. I was surprised looking at the checklist later that there is no mention of recalculating the landing numbers. I think this would be appropriate in the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). We were landing on Runway XXR in ZZZZ which is a long runway. I was not worried about having enough braking performance. The FO flying did a great job of touching down and going into full reverse. We stopped well prior to the end of the runway and turned off where we normally would have. We taxied to the gate with no further problems. As I said before; looking back I should have request priority and probably should have broken off the approach to checklist. My main hesitation was because we were in [foreign] airspace and the language barrier can be a problem there. The controller we had that night spoke very poor English. Probably the worst I have heard. But I should not have let that influence my decision as much as it did. Also; I believe the QRH checklist should have a statement about recalculating the performance. It is easy to overlook since you already have performance and the landing speed is not much greater.
1871935,While turning on to [taxiway] SC the aircraft started to slide. I placed the throttles in reverse idle to make sure I did not depart the taxiway that was covered in ice and snow. I was at my slowest possible but wanted to make sure that I had reverse thrust available if I continued to slide down SC that has a steep decline. The throttles did not come out of reverse idle but the right engine flamed out. We attempted to restart the right engine but approached a hot start approximately 547 degrees. We stopped the right engine start procedure and stopped taxiing because the taxiway condition was nil and could not get any traction with the nose wheel or differential breaking for the turn. Requested snow crews plow the ramp and tug crew pull us into the gate. We were towed without incident after the snow crews plowed the ramp.
1902440,Flight purpose: Practice Instrument Approaches (4). Aircraft started and ran up within run up parameters. Engine wasn't perfectly smooth; but developed power normally and idled without stalling. Flight continued normally for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Three approaches were performed. While receiving vectors for the final approach (ILS to landing); the engine suddenly ran incredibly rough. ATC coordinated an opposite direction landing on the nearest runway. In the landing flare; the engine was unable to maintain idle speed and stopped. Landing completed safely and aircraft pushed to parking. Maintenance inspection determined the IO-360 engine's #4 cylinder exhaust value had stuck causing the engine issue. The cylinder was replaced. Routine borescope inspections of the exhaust valves should be strongly considered during annual/100hr inspections to help catch failures before they occur in flight.
1884433,Aircraft X pushed from the gate at ZZZ and prior to engine start encountered a left Wing-body overheat indication. Dispatch and Maintenance Control consulted and the left pack deferred under MEL. Aircraft Bleeds and packs configured in accordance with MEL. Release 2 with deferral signed. Departure to the south; climb to initial altitude. Re cleared to 13;000 feet en-route to ZZZ1. Passing 10;000 feet cabin altitude and pressurization checked in accordance with SOP; cabin altitude 2;000 feet and differential pressure indicating that the aircraft was pressurizing. Contacted center and cleared to final cruise altitude of FL230. Passing 17;000 feet rechecked cabin altitude/differential pressure; cabin altitude 6;000 feet and differential pressure same as it was on the 10;000 check. Asked for final cruise altitude of FL190; granted. At level off; cabin altitude 8;000 feet and differential same as at 10;000 feet; check. Requested descent to 10;000 feet and cleared to 13;000 feet. In descent to 13;000 feet cabin altitude warning horn/light sounded and illuminated. Immediate action items complied with and descent to 10;000 requested again and granted. Checklist completed and warnings extinguished. Passenger masks did not deploy. [Requested priority handling]; flight attendants briefed. Talked to passengers. Rest of arrival [was] uneventful; landed and taxied to gate. Write up completed; Chief Pilot debriefed; Dispatch debriefed; ZZZ1 maintenance debriefed face to face in Operations Control.
1916409,Under positive VFR Flight Following with ZZZ Approach we had a near mid-air with uncalled; head-on traffic. We were in the cruise portion of our flight heading northwest towards ZZZ1 at VFR cruising altitude of 4;500 ft. Closest point of approach was well inside 500 ft. horizontally. We estimated a 300 foot pass. There was zero vertical miss distance. ADS-B was on board our aircraft; functional; and incorporated into ForeFlight. We received no traffic warning from that system. This led us to conclude that the conflicting aircraft was not being tracked by ZZZ Approach; likely squawking VFR-only; did not have ADS-B equipment on board; and was at an incorrect VFR cruising altitude. Near miss reported to ZZZ Approach ATC facility.
1883808,I had been cleared for the ILS XX approach at ZZZ and directed to maintain 3;000 ft. until established. I was in VMC conditions with a broken layer well below my altitude. I was vectored to the final approach course and intercepted it utilizing GPS. Outside the FAF; I attempted to switch NAV sources from GPS to LOC. I believed I had set the NAV 1 radio to VLOC. I later discovered that I had selected VLOC in the NAV 2 radio which was why I was unable to find a LOC 1 setting in my NAV source menu.Switching NAV sources caused the autopilot to disconnect. When I was unable to locate a 'LOC 1' in my NAV source menu; I became distracted by that issue and did not notice that the aircraft had entered a descent. When I did notice the descent; I incorrectly believed I was inside the FAF. Approximately ½ mile outside the FAF; I received a GPWS altitude alert. I responded to the alert by adding power and initiating a climb. Simultaneously; ATC issued a low altitude alert. I advised ATC that I was climbing and requested vectors for another approach. All of this occurred in VMC conditions above a low broken/scattered layer. The subsequent approach was completed without incident through a thin low broken/scattered cloud layer.Learning points. I will ensure that I closely monitor which radio I have configured for the approach. When the autopilot is engaged; I will ensure that I temporarily select HDG mode when changing NAV sources. When I had trouble with the NAV source selection; I should have reengaged the autopilot in HDG and ALT mode while I troubleshot the issue. If the issue could not be troubleshot in a timely manner; it would have been appropriate to request vectors for another approach; this would have provided additional time to identify the issue.While I regret that this incident occurred; I am thankful for my training which enabled me to immediately; and appropriately; respond to the GPWS message. In addition; I am appreciative of the alert ATC Controller who issued the low altitude alert. I am committed to lifetime learning and view this incident as a significant event that will help me be a more proficient pilot. I also plan to share with other pilots so that they may benefit from my learning experience.
1867845,During climb out of ZZZ experienced a series of violent shock vibrations passing 13;000 feet. ECAM message ENG 1 STALL. Retarded the left engine to idle and kept it running for the rest of the flight. With VMC conditions and being overhead ZZZ1; it was the logical choice to [advise ATC] and land ZZZ1. We were on a high left downwind already at 13;000 ft. and had not even begun to prepare for the approach and landing. Felt very rushed. Sent an ACARS msg to notify dispatch intending to say; '7700 landing ZZZ1' but instead accidentally sent; '7500 landing ZZZ1' which was inappropriate and confusing. Made PA to passengers of our intent to divert to ZZZ1 but; did not give Flight Attendent a full briefing. Also; did not Activate and Confirm and the FMGC remained in Descent mode. Awkward at first but corrected the thrust; and established and maintained a stabilized approach to [Runway] XXL; landing very smoothly in the touchdown zone. Allowed the aircraft to roll to an exit; where we were met by ZZZ1 CFR trucks who inspected the left engine. Then taxied uneventfully to the gate.
1933892,PAO had several aircraft in its normal right-hand pattern Runway 31. I departed PAO with the intent of flying a pattern. Upwind; I was advised to fly a left-hand pattern. Right hand pattern at PAO is 800 ft.; left hand pattern at 1;000 ft.On downwind; Tower advised me I was #4 for landing; to follow #3. I advised Tower I saw a traffic at my 9 o'clock. Based on my communication with the tower; I was under the impression that this was the traffic I was to follow; turned base after extending downwind a bit further. It turns out that what I had identified as the 9 o'clock traffic was the aircraft before the one the tower meant me to follow. On base; I see a traffic diagonally below (just turning final); I immediately turn to the right (pointing downwind); add power & climb. The tower instructs me to continue the downwind; the conflict aircraft; a light single; advised of a near miss; the tower advised that aircraft they may continue. The main issue was that I misinterpreted the aircraft to follow. I thought it was clear based on my communication with the tower; but that conclusion was erroneous. To prevent a recurrence; two suggestions: when a busy controlled tower has both left hand and right-hand traffic; the tower; on a best effort basis; should be encouraged to call base. I understand tower is at times reluctant to do so based on the varying speeds of aircraft; but faster aircraft could still wait an extra few seconds before turning base after receiving instructions based on their experience (or conduct S turns on final which is safer than a direct conflict of traffic turning base from both left hand and right hand traffic). For the pilot; stating 'traffic 9 o'clock in sight' is; with hindsight; not helpful as it may not be clear to the tower whether I'm referring to an aircraft on final (which I did) or possibly an aircraft on right downwind. Better would have been 'traffic 9 o'clock; on final; in sight'. More generally for the industry; better standardized phraseology for acknowledging seeing other aircraft in the pattern; absent of that; it may be best practice not to acknowledge seeing another aircraft; insisting that that the tower call the base.Upon landing; I taxied to parking to reflect on the event rather than do more pattern work as I had originally planned. A contributing factor - while I'm an experienced pilot by many measures; this aircraft is comparatively new to me - hence also the initiative to practice some landings. Nonetheless; it was somewhat of a training environment for me (I was practicing pattern work). As a lesson for myself - and possible guidance for others - is to consider taking another pilot or flight instructor along in such instances even when no Second In-Command (SIC) or CFI is required. I have done that in the past - including not long ago getting to know another aircraft's instruments better. And I suppose that's an important reminder to experienced pilots (notably also those mostly flying instrument approaches) pattern work requires and deserves the same attention as any other aspect of flying.
1898774,Coming into CLE we lost flight directors on both sides: possible temporary interruption of ground based facilities!?! Startle factor then went raw data as we went VMC simultaneously due to ceilings. Corrected for crosswind and slight level off with loss. Made stabilized approach from there in. Got a glide slope call out and perhaps a momentary dip but stabilized approach and landing.
1907990,ZZZ is home to X Skydiving; which claims they conduct XX;000 jumps onto the airport per year. Parachutists descend in large numbers to a landing zone on the southwest side of the airport. Charts depict a Parachute Jump Area (PJA) around the airport from surface to XX;900 feet; ASOS constantly warns pilots to 'avoid overflight when parachute operations are in effect'; and the pilot of the jump plane on frequency at the time of the near-miss was repeatedly announcing on CTAF that operations were in effect.  I departed the airport in self-launching motor glider and made a left downwind departure. Climbing through 7;100 feet; a small aircraft overflew me and into the PJA. There was no radio call from the small aircraft. I radioed the jump plane and alerted them to the passage of a NORDO plane through the jump zone at 7;100. The pilot thanked me for the head's up. I don't know if they altered their jump plans.Aircraft Y passed behind me traveling southwest at 7;380 feet and 143 knots. I was traveling northwest at 7;095 feet and 75 knots. There was 285 feet vertical separation and 427 feet lateral separation. I am not so sure of these numbers. It felt much closer. My plane is equipped with ADS-B OUT and I have several onboard collision avoidance displays. I did not see any warnings. My first indication was the flash of Aircraft Y passing over from my 4 o'clock to my 9 o'clock. I was flying solo from the left seat and did not have the ability to see behind and to the right. I would have been at their 11 to 12 o'clock and they were overtaking me by 70 knots. As a faster airplane overtaking a slower glider; the small aircraft should have seen and avoided me. They also should have exercised more caution flying into an active Parachute Jump Area. We were both extremely lucky there was no collision.
1872854,On takeoff; both the FA's (Flight Attendant's) and myself noticed a slight smell in the aft of the aircraft; but it dissipated; so we just thought it was the jet fuel or deicing fluid. We didn't notice any unusual smells during flight. On descent; the smell returned; a lot stronger. It could be smelled in the front of the Cabin; we did go up front and confer with one another to determine if we should call the pilots (it was below 10;000 ft.). We decided to notify them on landing; as the odor was the only concern. As we returned to our jumpseats; the odor got increasingly strong; a mostly a chemical smell (different from the normal jet fuel smell that is common on the Airbus on takeoff and landing). Both myself and the B Flight Attendant felt nauseated and the smell was irritating our throats. I was gagging and almost threw up; and the B Flight Attendant said her throat felt tight and she also felt nauseated. After we disarmed our doors; I went to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up. My head started throbbing and I felt very nauseated and throat felt tight. I called the Flight Deck to notify them of the incident. They didn't smell the same odor; but came back to assess; and then we all got off the aircraft so we could get some fresh air. We stood in the jetway; the B Flight Attendant and I kept feeling increasingly worse. My head felt foggy and I was very nauseated. The Captain suggested I use the pilot oxygen; as I was feeling pretty bad; (my eyes were closed but going back and forth uncontrollably). So I went into the Flight Deck and used the Pilot Oxygen. That did help a bit. After conferring as a crew and with the CSA's (Customer Service Agent); the CSA's called the paramedics. The A FA and the C FA made most attempts at the list of Air Quality contacts. Services wanted us to evacuate the jetway and get away from the aircraft; so we went into the terminal. As the paramedics evaluated us; we attempted on multiple phones to get in contact with MedAire. The A FA got a hold of someone first; and that person told the A FA that we each individually had to call on a separate phone call to speak with someone. The B FA & I waited on hold for 45 minutes; and were not successful in getting a hold of anyone to be cleared. In the meantime; the Chief Pilot gave the ok for us to be transported to the hospital (since we couldn't get a hold of anyone). This whole process of 'being cleared' to go to the ER took over an hour. Eventually the 3 Flight Attendants were transported to the Hospital by ambulance.
1897264,On final descent into ZZZ passing through 7000 ft. both FO (First Officer) and I experienced a fumes event (musty dirty socks smell). APU was off engines were near idle when the event started. We both donned our masks established few communication and continued the approach to Runway XX in ZZZ. After safely landing at the turnaround point on Runway XX we both opened the cockpit windows to get some fresh air into the flight deck and took our O2 masks off and taxied to our gate in ZZZ. Flight crew in the back said they experienced the same smell throughout the cabin. Everyone deplaned the aircraft on their own and unharmed.
1893822,I was landing at ZZZ in Aircraft X with a stable approach despite winds at 15 knots and gusts to 20-25 knots. After flaring I ballooned slightly after touchdown then was pushed toward the right by a gust. I applied a right rudder with left aileron but touched the brake then pushed the left rudder. This caused the plane to veer off to the left of Runway XX. There was no property damage or third party damage. I was the only occupant in the plane and I was not injured. To me there was no obvious damage to the plane but the A & P saw signs of a probable prop strike and a nose wheel misalignment.Lesson: Do not complete the landing with wind gusts to 25 knots even if the approach is stable - go around and choose the alternate airport.
1936906,After push back off of Gate XX; The flight crew on Aircraft X called the hangar controller radio stating they had an Anti Ice Standby Pitot AOA message. I reviewed the history of the aircraft and proceeded to have the crew do a circuit breaker reset for the Standby AOA. The fault cleared and the crew was informed to send an ACARS code when able; to log the reset into the history.  At this time the crew did not mention they had made a log for this and would need a new Maintenance Release. When I previously had checked; this aircraft had a valid Maintenance Release. Maintenance later called to notify me that the aircraft departed with an open log and did not have a valid Maintenance Release due to this. The flight crew did send the code after take-off however (ELB log XXXXXXX) at XA:47 local; they took off at XA:14.During the time I was working with the flight crew; we were on the tail end of a busy bank of flights and also several arrivals calling inbound logs. My time was not uninterrupted as I was multi-tasking with other tasks simultaneously. I have never had an aircraft leave without a valid Maintenance Release before this event and believe there was a failure on my part to re-check the ELB and also on the part of the flight crew to not communicate the log was open and they needed a new Maintenance Release. Working solo in this position puts far too much pressure on one individual and creates situations where you are distracted in many directions (phone calls; radio calls; operations center chat updates; vendors; people in the operations center approaching you when you are dealing with aircraft on the radio) all can lead to a situation like this where you lose full concentration and then move onto the next task without the time to properly go over the current event and make sure every step of our process has been followed.Always having two or more hangar controllers working per shift so one is able to work without being distracted when working technical issues on aircraft off the gate. The number of distractions can be extremely high and takes away our ability to fully concentrate on one task at a time. Double checking the ELB prior to an aircraft departing after pushback.
1867387,After landing in ZZZ; Aircraft X; while parked waiting for a gate; the aft FA (Flight Attendant) called the cockpit stating that during final descend around 6;000 ft. they smelled the dirty sock odor in the back of the airplane; the odor was present then went away during the final descent and the upon landing the odor came back and went away again. I told her that we were going to park; disembark and have Maintenance inspect the airplane. We parked shortly after and disembarked the passengers. I talked to the Flight Attendant number 1 and asked him about it and he told me that he went back and did not smell anything. I also asked him if the other [cabin] crew members were OK and he replied yes we all are OK. The odor was spontaneous and went away. I call Maintenance in ZZZ1 and reported the issue and made a log book entry. Maintenance ZZZ1 told me they will address the issue with maintenance in ZZZ.No further actions was required and all crew members went to the hotel and worked the next flight the next day without any complaints.
1875086,Aircraft released via Redmond SID and heading 170. Pilot checked on after departure correctly and I issued 'radar contact; leaving 7;000 [direct] SUNBE (couple hundred miles south) and restated climb to 140;00.' Read back was marginal with '[direct] SUNBE; maintain 14;000'. No alt to make turn so my assumption is he's going direct now. I restated 'SUNBE at 7;000 please' and he said to effect 'garbled... sorry SUNBE cross 7;000 and then 14;000 after that.' Typically; the aircraft is not even close to our Minimum Vectoring Altitude to go on course if Tower ships them in a timely manner at that point. Typically the jet will be on course in around 12 to 15 miles from departure. While this was going on I had several VFR practice approaches and VFR aircraft so my attention was drawn to potential conflict. I called in the blind for VFR aircraft as well as Tower. Somehow I missed that this jet actually read back fix 'cross' at 7;000 which would never in my years have made sense. I'm surprised that the pilot did not query me. 7;000 feet for 200+ miles or something like that then climb? Despite being distracted with the conflict potential and the fact that I heard fix; alt and top alt I trusted what I heard was issued. After the pilot asked when I came back online from the Tower I realized what may have happened and at that point reissued top altitude and for him to continue climb to my next higher terrain. On my part; hearing the crossing word had implications for sure. On the pilot side; the responsibility of accepting a clearance should have some weight.
1910520,Pushed back from gate.  Normal operations and engine start.  OAT 30 C; TOW 153.1; Flaps 5; bleeds ON; anti ice OFF; reduced thrust 92.8 N1 for Runway XXL.Called for Flaps 5  and we ran the after start checklist. Trim was set to 5.04 degrees in the green band.  Ran the Before Takeoff checklist 'to the line'; everything normal. We were #1 for takeoff so I asked for the Takeoff checklist below the line.   First Officer ran it; and I depressed the Takeoff Config switch with no sound so the system checked good.Approaching Taxiway 1 at [Runway] XXL Tower called out landing traffic on a 5 mile final to XXL and cleared us or takeoff.  We took the runway;   First Officer pushed power to 40% N1; engines stable; with NO Takeoff Config warning.  First Officer then pushed power to 85% N1 and selected autothrottles.  First Officer stated 'check thrust' and as I put my right hand on the throttles I replied ' thrust set 92.8%'.  Takeoff roll commenced with NO Takeoff Config warning.  I then called out '100 knots'.Runway XXL is quite bumpy for the first 2;000 feet to be noted.  Approaching 139 knots we got 2 horn sounds (cabin altitude horn sound) and a RED Takeoff Config warning light by my MFD.  I then announced rejecting at 140 knots and disconnected the auto throttles while quickly pulling the throttles to idle.  The speed brakes deployed and instantaneously RTO braking was activated.   I deployed the thrust reversers to Max and let the autobrakes slow us down.  As we were slowing First Officer called out '80 knots' and I started to stow the reversers and apply manual braking.  I also told Tower that  we were rejecting on XXL knowing that there was landing traffic behind us.  I remember hearing the Tower instruct the aircraft to Go-Around.  I should have had  First Officer tell Tower that we were rejecting as I had briefed on our pre-flight checklist; so that's one thing I would change for myself.We came to a stop and First Officer made the 'Remain Seated; Remain Seated' PA announcement and I made sure to NOT set the parking brake as we began the QRC for an RTO event and went through that checklist. We called for a fire truck to come check the tires and brake temps to make sure that we could taxi if possible as allowed by Brake Cooling chart.  First Officer and I at first misread the chart and thought we were in the warning temps.  So I called Dispatch and Maintenance Control while First Officer held the brakes for me.  After checking with Maintenance Control we corrected ourselves and learned that we were only in the caution zone and had to let the brakes cool for XX minutes before another takeoff was attempted.  Takeoff weight 153.1; 0 sea level correction; 140 knots speed.  Plus it would take 2 miles to taxi back; so add 10 more minutes.  At this point once we were confirmed in the caution zone I set the parking brake. We waited on the runway for approximately 15 minutes while talking to Fire Captain; Tower; FA's; passengers; Dispatch; Maintenance Control to ensure everything was stabilized; and no injuries or damage to tires and aircraft.  After that we taxied slowly to the parking [area] where we waited out our brake cooling time.  One thing that I would change is to make a note in the brake cooling temp charts that it is ACCEPTABLE to exit the runway with hot brakes so as not to close down a runway for a long time.  We had to talk to Dispatch and the Operations just to confirm that we could leave the runway prior to adhering to the brake cooling time limit.  I remember seeing that info hidden somewhere in the FM; but I couldn't remember exactly the protocol.  It would be helpful to have that info directly on the brake cooling chart.We waited out our brake cooling time in the parking area and had the Fire Captain check the brakes periodically with his FLIR gun.  We talked to the passengers and FA's frequently so as to give them information and keep them in the loop.  I turned OFF the seatbelt sign so passengers coulduse the restroom and retrieve cell phones to make calls.   After waiting out our time; I talked to the passengers and FA's again; turned ON the seatbelt sign; and the Fire Captain gave us the OK to taxi.  Then Ground let us taxi back to gate. We approached gate and of course a rain shower with lightning hits the field; so the ramp is closed. We once again inform the passengers and FA's as to what is going on.  We started to get long tarmac delay warnings from the ACARS. We soon got ramp clearance to taxi into the gate.Arrived at the gate and ran a parking checklist.Gate agents XXX and XXX assisted us with getting everyone off the airplane then I talked with the Fire Captain and the local mechanic.All in all it was an adrenaline packed event and I write this to the best of my recollection.  First Officer as well as our inflight team performed expeditiously and with professionalism which made this event much more manageable.  I want to recognize them for their efforts as well as our Maintenance Control and Dispatch team.
1879331,Night arrival on the JANNY 5. Outbound after WABBT and level at 5000 ft. MSL as assigned by ATC; received 'Whoop; Whoop; Pull Up' advisory from EGPWS (Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System). As Pilot Flying; initiated response by disconnecting the autopilot; maximum thrust; while pitching nose up while maintaining assigned heading. Advisory quickly went away and leveled at 5200 ft. MSL; notifying ATC. Descended back to 5000 FT and re-engaged the autopilot. No aircraft conflict during maneuver. Noticed [a] hill underneath the aircraft prior to EGPWS activation; but did not present itself as a threat visually. Also noted 'RA' on the MFD (Multi-function Flight Display) presented with terrain pop up during advisory.Wonder if the radio altimeter had malfunctioned due to 5G interference. As mentioned earlier; 'RA' flashed on the MFD with terrain pop up; and the Radio Altimeter varied prior to advisory. Though it was dark; the terrain did not visually present itself as a threat as I was looking outside throughout; and 5000 ft. is a normal vectoring altitude for ATC in that area. The only other possible cause would be closure rate with the terrain; we were flying at about 230 kts. due to traffic behind us. No real suggestion; except to see if 5G interference can trigger spurious EGPWS advisories.
1931953,On Day 0 at XA:06 on [Gate] XXX we were pushing out on the east line when we went to turn our aircraft the Tower gave 3 aircraft permission to enter the ally on the west line. We had to abruptly stop our push and let all inbound traffic proceed. While we were forced to stop our push because Aircraft Y turned off of the A taxiway. There has already been injuries due to these type of procedures.We had to take immediate action; stop the push and wait for the rest to proceed. We have to assume there was some type of delay that we did not want to incur. After the push we immediately went to our Crew Chief and Union Steward and filled a safety report. We should have been consulted; but again that was information that should have been relayed to us.
1934649,We were at spot XX waiting to call ground for taxi. Ground made a call; 'Spot XY?' before we were able to get a call in. There was nobody at spot XY at the time; and we were the only one in the vicinity; so we responded with our call sign thinking he was referring to us. Ground told us to give way to two jets and then taxi out. We waited for the two aircraft to pass and then began our taxi. ATC told another aircraft to give way to us. They complied and allowed us to taxi out. As we were pulling out of spot XX; ATC told spot XY to turn left and begin their taxi. As I was making the turn onto taxiway K; another ATC voice (maybe an instructor) came on and said 'Are you gonna give way?' with no call sign. ATC then came on and said 'Airline XXXX you were supposed to give way but you cut them off.' That crew was confused and said something along of the lines of 'We are giving way.' ATC seemed to think otherwise. The aircraft at spot XY mentioned our call sign and ground said 'I think you're right.' My First Officer (FO) told ground that we never heard an instruction to give way; to which they did not respond. We continued the rest of our taxi with no issue. A couple of minutes passed and the aircraft that ATC thought had made the mistake queried ground about the situation and ground responded with 'Don't worry about it;' leading me to believe that they had gotten call signs mixed up. There were multiple of the same airline flights in the vicinity and ATC was confused as to who was who. Not clarifying who was at which spot added to the confusion. When ground called up asking who was at spot XY; we could have clarified that we were at spot XX to avoid any confusion. We did not know that there was an aircraft behind us making their way to XY shortly after. Ground could have been more clear with their instructions and included the correct call signs with each instruction. With spots XY and XX in very close proximity and one aircraft (us) having already received taxi instructions; I think it makes more sense to let the aircraft that's already moving get out first.
1915625,We were on approach to DEN 35L; and had been advised of a Windshear Alert by Tower. At approximately 500 ft AGL we had a gust of wind that increased our IAS by about 10 knots and shallowed our approach to about 1 dot high on the ILS. The PF adjusted for these deviations appropriately. About the time our speed and G/S was coming back to parameters; we lost some headwind and incurred a settle. The PF recognized that the wind and power was out of cycle and initiated a go-around. About the time we were raising the flaps to 15 on the go-around profile; we got a 'Sink Rate' annunciation followed by a 'Pull Up' annunciation. We increased power and completed a normal go-around. We received vectors and came back to land at DEN 34R with no further issues. Upon review I realized that the 'Pull Up' annunciation should have prompted a Terrain Avoidance Maneuver.
1915213,The above situation was such a non event and Thermal Containment Bag (TCB) usage was only for an abundance of caution that I did not think this usage was an event. The purser did state she would submit a company report for the usage. Days later I found that the proper procedure was to make a maintenance write up for any TCB usage. I did not do that and since this was a required write up; I did depart with an incorrect logbook.
1884109,We decide to go to CKZ for work at uncontrolled fields. At first we were the only aircraft there. Our first lap in the pattern we had no issues. When starting our takeoff CKZ became very busy. After taking off an airplane announced extended downwind (on the upwind side) for Runway 26. Upon spotting the aircraft it was decided that the best action would be to extend our upwind and follow the spotted traffic after it passes. After the downwind aircraft closed to gap between us on the upwind; we announced we would turn left crosswind for 26 and follow them. After announcing I proceeded to do a full 180 degrees scan from left to right; upon completing the scan on the right I saw another aircraft very close on the right wing and slightly behind us trying to enter the pattern on a crosswind. I immediately banked left to increase the gap between our aircraft. Once the plane passed behind we decide it was best to leave the area to avoid any other possible conflicts. The aircraft entering the pattern should have either used a recommended pattern entry or allowed more space upon hearing the amount of traffic at CKZ. I feel better education on how to enter and announce in the traffic pattern may have avoided the situation all together.
1911661,On glide path received an RA to reduce descent. FO (First Officer) complied. Clear of conflict cured as FO stopped descent. Traffic passed beneath at 500 ft. Returned to glide path; stabilized before 1;000 ft. landed without further incident. ATC called out the traffic but did not expect it to fly below us whilst on the glide path.GA traffic should not be permitted to fly below the glide path of Runway 8 when aircraft are executing the ILS.  When any aircraft is on a glide path to Runway 8 no GA traffic should be in the vicinity.
1887918,I; the First Officer; (on a no passenger ferry flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZZ2) noticed that the captain's windscreen had a blackish 'streak' developing. (Likely an overheated windshield heater overheat). Moments later; maybe 1 minute; the screen developed many cracks basically the entire window. After the first crack we had requested priority handling with ATC and asked for and received a lower altitude. We followed the appropriated checklists and had an uneventful approach and landing into ZZZ3 (after asking to divert to ZZZ3). I had to do the landing as the Captain's windscreen was cracked and visibility was poor through it. The ATC vectoring; to accommodate time to accomplish checklists; was excellent as was the priority handling in general.
1906380,We were operating flight ZZZ to ZZZ1. Parked at gate; doors closed; we asked for a push back clearance. Ramp Control asked us to call Ground for push back to spot XY. We made the call to Ground and they said to give way to airplane behind us and then cleared to push to spot XY. I relayed the exact information to the Ramp Agent. After a short wait we started pushing back; and then the Ramp Agent stopped the push back process and advised that there is an airplane behind us. We queried Ramp Control; while they were busy handling the conflict and talking to the other airplane. After a few seconds; a different Ramp Agent talked to us from the push back tug and informed us that he will have to tow the airplane back into the gate to allow for the inbound airplane to park at gate X. And so we did; and I informed the passengers about the situation. After the airplane parked at gate X; we received a clearance to push back. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The entire situation happened with our airplane nose pointing towards the terminal and so; it was difficult to understand what was going on behind the airplane and how close we were to that inbound aircraft during the push back process. We didn't hear Ramp Control clearing that inbound airplane to gate X. One way to minimize future similar threat is perhaps; for Ramp Control to communicate with Ground to coordinate push back clearances when necessary.
1873231,Going into BHM I was the Pilot Monitoring. Weather conditions were clear; but winds were gusty; making for a bumpy ride in the descent. After I obtained the ATIS; the Captain and I planned and briefed for the Visual 24; backed up with the ILS. Winds were 320@11 and runways 24 and 36 were in use at the airport. The altimeter setting was 30.18.Upon contacting Approach; we found out the current winds were 330@16 with gusts of 28 kts. We discussed the winds and determined we were getting close; but still within limits of landing Runway 24. Around leveling off at 3000 ft.; Approach informed us that the winds had shifted to 350@15 G25 and that they were now landing runways 06 and 36. We opted for the Visual 36 since the winds were favoring that runway and we already had the landing data.We briefed and discussed the particular threats for the Visual 36; which was going to be backed up with the RNAV 36. Along with it being a night landing; we recognized we would not have a GS and PAPI; and we were aware that BHM has surrounding terrain which can pose a hazard. When Approach offered to give us vectors for a 10 mile final for 36; we gladly accepted to help eliminate the terrain risk and set up for a stabilized approach.We were vectored in to intercept the final prior to IMOBY. Once cleared for the Visual 36; we descended to the crossing altitude of 2800 ft. The next waypoint on the approach was BERFY; which was the FAF and had a crossing altitude of 2300 ft. We crossed that waypoint on profile; set the DDA altitude; and continued down at 800fpm. Right after the 1;000 ft. call out; the GRD PROX switch light illuminated. We might have been slightly below snowflake; but seemed on profile. We did not get any aural warnings. Around the same time; Tower informed us of a low altitude alert. At that point the Captain initiated a go-around. Once stabilized; we set up the approach; and landed Runway 06 with no further issues.
1917229,During the initial climbout of OKC we got an Air/Ground message on EICAS. We continued our climb and once we were out of sterile and at a safe altitude we ran the QRH; which said that we could possibly not have steering and thrust reversers. We patched through to Dispatch who connected us to a Maintenance Supervisor. The Supervisor informed us that the light would most likely extinguish when we dropped the gear. We continued the flight and decided we would compute the numbers for both scenarios; the light extinguishing; and the light not extinguishing with the unfactored landing distance times 1.7. Working as a crew we decided we would extend the gear early and that if the light did not extinguish we would request priority handling out of an abundance of caution and in case we didn't have reversers or steering.When we got the ATIS at ZZZ they were using the east directional runways and the winds were out of the South; 20 gusting 30. According to the QRH we were supposed to run the unfactored landing distance; flaps 45; times 1.7. Given the winds we did not feel flaps 45 was appropriate so we ran the numbers flaps 22 times 1.7. The number we came up with was about 8;000 ft. and we had about 9;000 feet of available runway. We didn't feel comfortable with that number and decided; as a crew; we would request Runway XXL out of an abundance of caution. From this point we continued the flight and on the arrival extended the gear early; but the light did not extinguish. As previously briefed; we requested priority handling and asked for the longer runway.At some point on the approach; while deviating around a thunderstorm and lightning; we were read new winds which were still out of the south but at just 15 kts. We reran the numbers at flaps 45 times 1.7; per the QRH and had much better numbers; especially now that we had requested 15L. Throughout the whole flight; Name and I communicated with Dispatch; Maintenance; Passengers; our FA; and ATC to the greatest extent possible. Name requested from ATC to have the plane met by emergency vehicles and said that we would need a tow. I was a little confused because the QRH stated that we 'may' not have steering or reversers; but he told me we would not and that he had just done this in the sim the week prior. We continued that approach and had a safe landing; bringing the plane to a stop on the runway and emergency vehicles stated the aircraft seemed fine.Shortly after landing I inquired why we don't just try to taxi to the high speed using rudders or see if the steering worked. Name said he was sure it wouldn't work and was concerned about the possible of uncommanded swerving. We were towed to the gate and the passengers deplaned normally and no one was hurt. I believe we were in a high stress environment trying to accomplish a flight while also communicating with multiple agencies and dealing with bad weather. As the person reading the QRH I think I should've been more assertive with the fact that the QRH said 'may not have...'. I also feel I should've been more assertive once we were on the ground about attempting to taxi; in order to clear the runway. I also think Name may have had some training biases due to a recent similar training event in the sim. Later discussion made me realize that he thought we would have no brakes and no steering; where I was definitely under the impression it was just a possibility of no reversers and no steering. In the end we worked well as a crew; but there were some lapses in communication; but the overall outcome was a safe landing where no one was hurt.
1924766,On the visual approach into Runway 28L at SFO; everything was very routine until around 2;500 ft. We were following Aircraft X and trying to avoid his wake. We entered a headwind shear where we went from a stable 170kts to what I saw a peak of 195kts. The CA (Captain) was flying and I was monitoring. Because of this shear the airplane became high on the glide path and the autopilot was reluctant to descend because of the high airspeed even though the shear was subsiding; so the airplane being high issue was getting worse. The CA then clicked off the autopilot and pushed the nose over and called for gear down and flaps 15 around 2;200 ft. Once speed allowed the CA called for flaps 25 and shortly after that we passed 1000 ft. and accomplished the normal callout. Flaps 30 was called for shortly after and we were stable and able to meet the 500 ft. gate and landed normally.The fixation on trying to get the aircraft slowed down and back on profile led us to not realize we passed through the 1000 ft. gate without being fully configured and landing checklist complete. We completed the 1;000 ft. callout more out of routine muscle memory instead of evaluating the current configuration. We debriefed and came to the easy conclusion that we should have gone around as soon as we realized we could not meet the criteria of the 1000 ft. gate. Overall a busy traffic environment; gusty wind day; automation not doing what we needed; led us to lose some situational awareness and turn threats into errors.
1922845,During a dual training flight; we had to abort the takeoff during the takeoff ground roll due to really strong engine roughness. The engine was almost about to shut down few times on the takeoff roll and during the aborted takeoff. After aborting the takeoff safely; we notified ATC and safely taxied back to Company Ramp. Then the airplane was squawked for maintenance action.
1914398,An electrical odor became viral in Main Cabin 5 minutes before door closure. Flight Attendant Y smelled a burn wiring odor in the cabin during boarding and after door closure. The Flight Deck was notified immediately on both occasions. However there wasn't notifications of a fire. Old or defective air vents tend to be the cause of burn wiring smell during the summer as the aircraft cools down. I immediately secured everything in the Galley and walk into the Cabin to inspect the situation with the intentions to fight an electrical fire. The aircraft returned to the Gate and deplaned following protocol. The Mechanics came on board at ZZZ Airport to inspect the aircraft for any bad wiring.
1870315,While descending into DEN on the CLASH4 STAR near JAAAM intersection at 13;000 ft.; we received a GPS-L Invalid message followed by a GPS-R Invalid message. We noted the FMC was not receiving a GPS signal. We reported the anomaly to Dispatch and ATC who advised us that many other aircraft were encountering similar GPS issues. We continued VMC to landing. After landing I noted my iPad was not receiving a GPS position as well. While taxiing to the gate; both my iPad and the aircraft reacquired a GPS signal.
1916258,On the late evening; we were operating our flight ZZZ2 to ZZZ1. The takeoff; climb; cruise; and descent went as expected. During the Descent to Approach phase; we did receive a Master Caution Light for the YAW DAMPER. The Captain ran the QRH and the resolution was to not exceed Flaps 30; End of Checklist. During the approach phase on a visual for Runway XXL; we join the localizer for XXL at ZZZZZ. I was the pilot flying (PF) so I called for 'Flaps 1' to begin to slow back to 210 kts. We had the proceeding aircraft insight and the field; so we called both 'in-sight' to ATC. We got cleared for the visual XXL following traffic and were instructed to slow back to '170 kts.' to a 5 NM Final. Given the heavy traffic congestion that night going into ZZZ1 and the proceeding traffic in-front of us; I continued to call for FLAPs 5; then Gear Down with Flaps 15; then eventually Flaps 25. The Captain mentioned that I was going too fast for Flaps 25. That's when we both noticed the Amber Ban on the Airspeed indicator was greater than our bugged speeds. At that same moment we both noticed our flaps never extended out of Flaps UP which explains why we had a hard time slowing down. We both determined we needed to Go-Around. We were instructed to turn left heading 250 and maintain 4;000. We executed the missed approach procedure and reconfigured the airplane to level flight. I turned on the Autopilot and kept my speed around 210 kts. Not having too much fuel onboard (had around 6;000 pounds of fuel) I didn't want to get too far away from the airport as we were problem solving the flap issue. Once reaching clean configuration; the Captain gave me the airplane and he ran the QRH to determine what the problem was. Talking with ATC; I knew we had some sort of FLAP Malfunction and told him we will need Runway XXR. I started to set up the aircraft for the ILS XXR. After a few short vectors; the Captain determined we should plan for a FLAPS UP landing. We gathered FLAPS UP landing numbers and re-bugged the aircraft. The approach and landing went as planned. We touchdown and exited around Taxiway 1 in ZZZ1 where we had the fire trucks waiting for us. We had the fire trucks follow us into the ramp area to make sure everything looked good on the airplane. After entering the ramp area and executing the after landing check; everything looked normal to us. We asked the ramp to [for] the fire trucks to be waived off. We arrived at the gate and completed our post flight duties and then contacted Dispatch and the Duty Pilot.
1935549,I was giving the refresher flight to the pilot who wanted to practice some touch and goes from the right seat. The pilot has his Commercial Single Engine and Multi Engine Land License; Certified Flight Instructor license and about 250 hours of flight time on the same make and model of the plane (C172). After we completed the flight and performed all of the shutdown checklists we decided to push the plane to the parking spot which is located close to our hangar at ZZZ. It's worth to note that the parking spot is on a small uphill. I took the towbar and asked the student to push the plane by the wing strut. It turned out the towbar was broken (it was loose so I couldn't attach it to the nose gear). I decided to go to the rear of the plane and steer it by pushing the tail down and move it to the left/right. Once we moved the plane to the spot I looked around to find a chock to put it by the tire so the plane doesn't roll down but there were no chocks available in the vicinity of the plane. I still kept the tail preventing the plane from rolling down and asked the student to pull the parking brake so we could install the tiedowns. After the few seconds I hear huge 'BANG' and the shock wave threw me away from the plane. It turned out that the student activated the BRS parachute system in the plane. The airport fire/rescue team responded immediately and showed up on the scene about a few minutes later. It's also worth to say that the handle for the BRS system is guarded and in RED color. After I interviewed the student why he pulled that handle he responded that he didn't know what's that so he assumed that it has to be the parking break. Again; student had flown this make and model multiple times before.
1893168,Shortly after takeoff out of ZZZ airport we got an auto press caution message at around 3;500 ft. We elected to level off at 5000 ft. and get vectors away from the storms. I was Pilot Flying. I took controls and radios and asked my First Officer to pull out the Quick Reference Checklist and Quick Reference Handbook for Auto Press Caution message. We completed the checklists. Advised Dispatch; ATC; and Flight Attendants. I received reports of ear discomfort from the Flight Attendants.I noted we had passengers onboard who were susceptible to medical issues from potential extraneous ear pressure; i.e. babies and older passengers. We elected to return to the airfield in the interest of safety. Other contributing factors I had in mind were storms; high cruising altitude; high task saturation; and the increase of risk factor of potential further issues/emergencies/failures that could arise in flight on top of the already highly task saturated duty of manual pressurization and deviations of storms.Auto pressurization failure; inner ear pressure issues potentially causing damage. Task saturation. If anything else were to occur during flight on top of having to dedicate duties away from flying to control the pressurization manually then it would increase risk factor and degrade pilot attentiveness and safety of flight further.
1894719,Due to the wind conditions; I should not have flown. I gave into what I felt was a pressure that I needed to fly; and that was my first mistake. I flew one lap around the pattern; landed; and my landing was smooth. I went around one more time; and upon landing; I encountered a gust of wind. When that gust went away; the plane fell onto the runway rather than landing smoothly. I didn't realize it at the time; but the tail of the plane hit the runway and the tie down ring was snapped off along with some other damage. After that landing; I realized that I should have come in with less flaps and a higher airspeed. On my last landing of the day; the tire came off of the rim. Originally it was thought that the tie down ring popped the tire and caused it to deflate. The plane had to be tugged off of the runway. Later it was found that the tire actually came off due to a side load; and was not popped. As far as I could tell; my last landing was the smoothest of the day; and I don't remember being sideways at all; but some side load was imposed on the tire causing it to come off of the rim. Airport authority then found the tie down on the runway after I informed the tower about my situation.
1880910,Captain [was] Pilot Flying and First Officer [was] Pilot Monitoring. Takeoff roll on Runway XXL was uneventful. On climb out; Pilot Monitoring noticed the autothrottle (A/T) disengaged and re-engaged it. It happened a second time with the same results. The number 2 engine had trouble exactly matching the commanded climb thrust. I also reengaged the A/T at least once. After engaging the autopilot around 5-6;000 ft. MSL; Pilot Flying noticed excess yaw and roll and disengaged autopilot. Both pilots noticed the number 2 engine was at approximately 60 percent N1 with a white arc showing commanded vs actual position. There were no other engine indications or abnormalities. The crew accomplished Immediate Action Items for the 'Engine Limit or Surge or Stall' checklist. Pilot Monitoring requested an intermediate level off at 10;000 ft. and continued course. Captain gave First Officer radios and Pilot Flying duties shortly after leveling of at 10;000 ft.After the turn at ZZZZZ on the ZZZZZ2; ZZZZZ1 SID; ATC gave vectors to remain in the local area. Aircraft was at 10;000 ft. MSL; 230 KIAS near location west of ZZZ. The crew ran the remainder of Quick Reference Handbook for 'Engine Limit or Surge or Stall' checklist and coordinated with local Maintenance and Maintenance Control/Dispatch; notified passengers and FM. Requesting priority handling by ATC and crew simultaneously when 20-25 minutes into flight the engine rolled back and failed. Crew ran the 'Engine Failure or Shutdown' checklist and the 'One Engine Inoperative Landing' checklist. Crew planned and executed an overweight; single engine; return to ZZZ. To land below max landing weight we would have needed to fly for roughly 2 more hours. A planned overweight visual approach to Runway YYL via vectors to a 10-mile final with 15-flaps was uneventful with a smooth landing. Crew taxied to Gate XX and shut down the remaining engine to wait for baggage/pallet carts to be moved and then tow-in.No sooner than we had parked; Crew Scheduling called me; notifying us that we would be leaving in roughly 65 minutes to ZZZ1. We decided that we needed to re-evaluate our fitness for duty and needed to speak to Union representation before proceeding any further. We then spoke to Maintenance Control over the phone and then hub maintenance at the aircraft to discuss the events. We had noticed that the Fuel Pump Package had been replaced that morning with an engine run accomplished. The number 2 HMU; Heat Exchanger and Fuel Pump were replaced following the engine failure in flight. A member of the Chief Pilot's office; and later the Chief Pilot; met us at the aircraft to check on us; coordinate with Company (scheduling; Chief Pilot; etc) and accomplish a [safety evaluation]. We reached a mutual conclusion it was not in the best interests of safety to fly as we were still processing the chain of events during the flight and the associated stress/workload.We accomplished a thorough debrief and reconstruction of the flight. Preflight: Both of us woke early due to the nature of the schedule. It was day 2 of the 4-day pairing; with an early show ZZZ2-ZZZ3 on day 1. Originally scheduled to fly ZZZ3-ZZZ; the pairing had been changed to a deadhead due to equipment substitution. The evening was relaxing and we were both asleep early. I slept from XA:00 pm until XJ:30am. In the morning I had a very long hold time with the Company's Agent on Demand before van pickup time at XM:02 AM. The flight plan was released while I was getting ready for the van ride. I knew we had a longer van ride; so I did not expect this to be a problem. We left the hotel on time and reviewed the flight plan en route. We were scheduled for a random southerly route ZZZ-ZZZ1 at FL300 due to significant impacts from turbulence and convective activity/SIGMETS; increasing the complexity. The Dispatcher had asked the Captain to call regarding this flight; which I did during the van ride. We both had significant distractions with thefunctioning of the weather app on our EFBs (this is an ongoing issue where it attempts to connect and then drops connectivity).On arriving at the airport; we had the additional task of [Covid procedures]. I went to the mission planning area while the First Officer went to the aircraft to begin the preflight to save time. The 45-minute report time was compressed; especially with the additional attention to weather/turbulence and verifying the random route points. Fortunately; we departed Gate XY; close to the satellite mission planning room; saving some time. There was some pressure from the Gate Agents for us to leave and then the ramp personnel were waiting for us to push. I used CRM and our company process approach to ensure everything was ready to go before releasing brakes. Taxi: We planned Runway ZZR for departure; and Ground Control changed us to ZZL. I called for the runway change procedure and we were split-task for a few minutes to update the required information. The remainder of the taxi out was uneventful.
1912579,Descending via the Ironman 2; passing through 5;500 ft. or so encountered a drone 1.5-2.0 miles west of DAJHR. Estimate the drone came within 100 ft...black in color and was small. Within 30 seconds; bundle (5-6) mylar balloons with small parcel attached passed underneath the aircraft estimated within 100 ft. Drone passed off right side of aircraft and only seen by First Officer (FO). Balloons passed off left side of aircraft and only seen by Captain (CA).LAX Approach Control notified of both events. For information only.
1876841,While in flight at level cruise at FL320; I was in the bunk in the rear of the aircraft when I noticed a power reduction. Immediately afterwards; the seat belt sign illuminated and I made my way to the flight deck. There was a FLAPS DRIVE EICAS with an expanded flap display indicating that the right mid-span leading edge flap deployed. As a result the airspeed band became very tight between Mmo and the yellow band as the FMC wanted to honor the maximum flap extension speed. This was in close proximity to our stall speed. The auto throttle was disconnected and the Pilot Flying manually maintained Mach. 75. We consulted with the company via sat-phone and were advised to return to ZZZ. We coordinated with ATC for the return and fuel dump. An uneventful landing was made below MLW.
1916410,During cruise flight; a small fuel leak was observed over the top of the wing. It didn't appear to be substantial; but was still a cause for concern. A direct routing to the airport was established. No diversion was performed because the descent for the destination airport had already started and the engine monitors indicated normal operations. After a few minutes; the fuel leak no longer was showing signs over the top of the wing. The engine; as a result; was not shut down. A landing was made and engines were quickly shut down after clearing the runway. Upon exit of the aircraft; the leak underneath the wing which was not visible in flight was substantial. Inspection determined that a fuel bladder had ruptured.
1895461,Aircraft XI received a turnover from 1st shift on Aircraft X. The left inboard fuel tank plate was leaking. Access door XXXXX opening. When I removed the interior plate the rubber gasket was stuck to the inside of the wing structure and had a 5 inch strip of cracked and dry sealant that to me was the cause of the leak. I installed a new gasket IAW with the AMM and installed the plate. Leak check was good when fuel was transferred into the center tank. I signed off the job on log page X.I have not replaced many fuel panels. I had confirmed the tank hole for the write up but was unaware that the plate number for the opening should be confirmed to match.(The AMM does not suggest this.) I realized this after the aircraft came back with the same issue. I had indexed the plate on removing it so it would not be reinstalled incorrectly. Unfortunately the wrong plate was installed previously and I did not catch it on the reinstallation. The index point (door key) was deformed previously so the tank seemed to fit with no hesitation. In my limited experience if a plate is installed incorrectly the then the door key will not let you place the plate in the cavity.  It appears  the plates for XXXXX and XXXXY were switched at a previous installation. (It was found that the other wing had the same for the two innermost tank plates - XXXXZ and XXXXA) I also found that the plates with fuel sticks have a decal in front of the plate as well. Again not referenced to check this in the AMM. I will be suggesting a tech ops training video on fuel tank removal and reinstallation techniques for our various fleet types at The Company. I had looked while performing the job and there is not one referencing this. I will also be following the fuel pressurization procedures to the letter- as opposed to the 'Norm' of simply filling the tank and checking for leaks. I would say the dirty dozen aviation maintenance gotchas on this would be lack of knowledge; lack of resources; pressure and norms. I've learned not to assume any part was put into an aircraft correctly by a previous Technician.
1887173,After departing ZZZ1; at XA05 and landing at ZZZ; at XB18 my First Officer; and I listened to the ASOS at ZZZ 3 times before landing and it was reporting the wind at 260 degrees at 15 kts. gusting to 27 kts. The maximum crosswind for a Citation Ultra is 20 kts. Runway heading at ZZZ is 295 degrees; 35 degrees off the nose of a 27 kt. wind equals a 15 kt. crosswind component; well within the maximum of the 20 kt. crosswind for a Cessna 560. After completing the before landing check list we listened to the ASOS one more time and there was no significant change. Upon touching down on the runway the airplane weather vaned to the left from wind striking the vertical stabilizer and there was not enough right rudder to keep the airplane on the runway. After rolling through the grass for about 500 ft. I was able to taxi back onto the runway and taxi the airplane back to our hangar. No runway lights were damaged by our airplane.
1892506,Nose gear failed to retract on departure. Flew out to south of ZZZZ and held and ran checklist for Gear Disagree. Burned fuel down to Maximum Landing weight. Extended gear as we departed the hold. All indications normal. Landed normally about 2000 lbs. Below maximum landing weight. No mayday was declared. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was in place on landing. Flight cancelled. First Officers did an exceptional job.
1927753,Rolled onto runway for take-off once given our clearance from tower for take-off. Both my student and I heard the audible CAS (Crew Alert System) message warning and noticed the red temperature warning on cylinder number three. We then rejected our take-off and announced with Tower that we would be taxiing off the runway. Once off the runway we contact Ground and alerted Ground that we would be shutting our engine down to avoid damaging our engine. We requested assistance from the ground crew; I called our Maintenance Manager who was on duty and request that they bring the cart to tow the airplane back to our hanger.
1921632,We were scheduled to take passengers out of EGE. The initial clearance we received on the ground was to depart Runway 25 and climb via the BEVVR 1 departure RUBAY transition; the top altitude of which is 15;000 ft. We briefed our plan A and B; and the Captain made special emphasis on cleaning up the aircraft at 7;000 ft. (slightly above our normal level off altitude of 400 feet). We took off Runway 25 and made the turn to COPER. During the climb I was slightly late (about 50 feet) on making the 7;000 foot call out; so the Captain called it out and we cleaned up the aircraft. Around 8;300 feet; Tower called and advised us to maintain 10;000 feet; contact Center. I don't remember if it was Tower or Center; after checking in with them that told us to expect higher shortly. I set the altitude selector to 10;000 ft.; called out '10;000 set and 9;000 climbing 10;000.' Looking back I don't remember if the Captain acknowledged my call outs as required by our SOPs. This should have been an indication to me to verify the altitude with him again and to check with Tower to confirm the instructions. I called Center and advised that we were '9;000 climbing 10;000.' We had the TAWS page up prior to take off and we could see the terrain visually. We were in the black the whole time and didn't received any sort of TAWS alert. We leveled off at 10;000 and maintained the speeds required by the departure while we waited for a higher altitude as we had been previously advised. Between BEVVR and APRES we received a low altitude alert from Center and were cleared to FL260. Center advised us that the MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude) in that area was 13;100 ft. and told us that there was a required climb gradient on the SID for a reason. We of course began our climb to FL260; advised Center that we had been assigned 10;000 ft. and asked them to mark the tapes and provide us with a phone number so we could call once we reached our destination. I still don't know if the Tower Controller had misspoke or if I had misheard the altitude instruction; but a lapse of communication took place somewhere. I should have questioned the unusual altitude assignment with the controller and verified that the Captain heard the same instructions as I had.
1886142,We landed on Runway XX ZZZZ. As soon as we started to turn around for the back taxi; we heard tower communicate to the first of two Caravans on short final to prepare for a go-around. The response from the Caravan was 'Plenty of time'. Both my First Officer and I were unsettled to say the least as we turned the aircraft around and went head to head with the landing aircraft. I expedited towards Taxiway 1 but ATC correctly decided this was getting too close and told the Caravan to 'go-around.' The Caravan responded 'Still plenty of time.' and continued his approach. ATC instructed him a second time to 'go-around' and after a long silence the Caravan responded 'we still have time'. It was at this moment that I became concerned for our safety. The Caravan was on about 1/2 mile final 300 feet above the Runway as I stated to turn onto taxiway 1. I quickly exited the runway as ATC strongly commanded the Caravan to 'go-around' for the third time and the Caravan complied.
1928548,Shortly after takeoff; the CA (Captain) and I heard an unusual sound coming from the lower forward fuselage. While conducting After Takeoff cleanup items; we noticed the EQUIP annunciation light was illuminated. We ran the QRH checklist and determined the aircraft wasn't pressurizing. We called Departure; advised them of our situation; and requested to return to ZZZ RNAV XX. Approximate weight was 142;000 lbs.; so we were below maximum landing weight. Everything was uneventful; we landed and went to Gate XX shortly after landing.Upon arrival at the aircraft we noticed the #1 IDG was disconnected; MEL was properly annotated in the logbook; switches were placard. The APU would have to be online for the entire flight. Thus; we would have the DRIVE annunciation light illuminated during the flight. It's possible we missed the EQUIP light on the overhead panel thinking it's was the DRIVE light due to its close proximity. Thoroughly scan the overhead panel during the system annunciation recall.
1870347,Aircraft X on arrival from ZZZ-DEN flying the ZZZZZ RNAV Arrival on XXR transition but then updated to a visual approach for Runway XXL.  ATIS information warned of ADS-B and GPS issues around DEN airport.  Approximately 10nm North of ZZZZZ1 at approx 15;000 feet got 'GPS Primary Lost' FMGC indications for both Captain and First Officer as well as loss of EFB location information.  Shortly thereafter got NAV ADS-B FAULT Channel 1 and Channel 2 and NAV TCAS FAULT alert message.  After about 30-45 seconds GPS PRIMARY was restored and alert messages cleared on their own.  30-45 seconds later the pattern repeated.  Visual with the airfield I elected to disengage autoflight and auto thrust to fly manually.  The alert message pattern continued for 3-4 cycles until Captain opted to select 'EMER CANCEL' on the alert message system to stop the distraction of multiple repeating alert messages.  Multiple aircraft on DEN Approach radio frequencies reported similar issues in the general area.  It was enough that DEN Approach Controller began broadcasting a warning to all aircraft on his frequency to expect ADS-B and GPS interference problems.After landing the Capt and I informed maintenance at the gate but did not submit a write-up.  We agreed that with so many other aircraft in the area reporting the same issues on approach frequencies and the ATIS warning this was almost certainly an airspace/airport problem and not an aircraft system problem. As of this morning DEN ATIS reports 'GPS; TRANSPONDER; ADS-B ANOMALIES REPORTED IN THE DENVER AREA.' [Our location was] 10nm North of ZZZZZ1 on ZZZZZ RNAV Arrival.
1915468,Performing a #2 service on Aircraft X; found door 2R emergency exit light assembly not installed. Further troubleshooting discovered the area had been panlamed over. Gained access to lower panel of aft galley and found wires dangling. Had to order new lite assembly to install and hook up wiring. Similar to Aircraft Y which had same problem 2 days earlier.
1906462,On the night of DATE; I was responding to a gate call for A/C X parked at gate; ZZZ to ZZZ1; for the following write up created by the pilot; log X at XA:47 'NUMBER 1 ENG FIRE HANDLE DOES NOT ILLUMINATE DURING FIRE TEST'. After initial T/S (Trouble Shooting); I confirmed the fault; and after talking to the lead of [the zone] over the phone; he told me to request an MEL; because the fault was intermittent and could not be cleared. I initiated the request for MEL. While I was in the process of doing so; I accidentally cleared the log page X @ XB:30; instead of deferring it; which was just discovered when I was speaking with M/C (Maintenance Control); over the phone. M/C then told me to open another log and resubmit it. I open the log page Y @ XC:36 'NO 1 ENGINE FIRE HANDLE DOES NOT ILLUMINATE'; but I was not able to submit the MEL; still talking with M/C over the phone asking for help in resubmitting the MEL; M/C said that the aircraft was maintenance released and he could not help any longer. Immediately I called the lead back and asked him if he was the person whom released the aircraft. He replied that the aircraft was released by the Zone Supervisor; maintenance release X @ XD:33. At this point; the crew probably saw the maintenance release been printed and advised the ramp to start pushing the aircraft and they left the gate. I went after the lead to let him know that the aircraft was leaving and I did not have a chance to apply the MEL; because the maintenance release was issued and the aircraft brakes had been released. When I walked into the Supervisor's office the lead was talking to the supervisor for a swap for [the aircraft]; because the deferral for the MEL would take too long; the Supervisor was on the phone; asking for a swap when [they were told] that the aircraft had departure. Supervisor told me to contact M/C and ask for help. I contacted M/C but nothing could be done while aircraft was in the air. Aircraft X landed safely at ZZZ1 and log Y was cleared @ XE:50. This is how I remember this incident to the best of my knowledge.
1888589,After block in at ZZZ the Lead Flight Attendant came up to the Flight Deck and said we had a pretty strong Odor coming from the Forward Gallery area that smelled like jet fuel. She said the Odor began just before we lowered the landing gear on approach into ZZZ and dissipated as we were taxiing to the gate. Both Flight Attendants described the order as being 'Strong and a bit irritating'. Maintenance Control was then notified; and logbook entry was made as well as a Fume/Odor report. A mechanic was quick to meet us at the gate and was briefed.
1918662,On Day I was hired to take photos of a residential home in Location. The location of the home was about XXX miles away from my home. On my way to the location; the realtor sent me the location of the home. Once I located the house I realized that it was near the airport. Having been so far from home; I made a choice to fly the drone to take photos of the property to have to avoid a return XXX mile trip. I was aware of the location so I stayed at a low altitude and made sure to complete the operation with a few minutes. Due to previous issues in the past requesting permission to fly near that airport; I had trouble requesting access to fly; to which I assumed it would be difficult again. I flew right above the tree line and was finished in about 5 minutes to avoid any possible safety issue with manned aircraft.
1910309,I was doing pattern practice on 25R at ZZZ having completed six circuits.  On my 7th approach and landing holding the center line required full left rudder.  On touchdown I didn't release enough rudder causing the nose wheel to alternatively skip and grab making directional control difficult.  We ran out of rudder authority and departed the runway to the left (slightly) at intersection Charlie and clipped a sign inflicting damage to the sign and left wing.The left wing leading edge suffered a dent with a small hole in the center.  Damage was limiting to the sheet metal surface (leading edge) in line with the left main wheel. Close inspection shows no internal damage; superficial sheet metal damage only.
1910591,On climbout received alerts indicating a loss of hydraulic fluid in system #3. Fluid eventually went to Zero.  Complied with our QRH procedures; [requested priority handling] and diverted to ZZZ1 as per operations control request. Uneventful arrival and  landing.Cause - Loss of hydraulic fluid in system #3. Systems malfunction.
1902168,Strong burning smell in the aircraft while climbing through FL250 with a rapid increase in temperature both in the Cockpit and Passenger Cabin. [Requested priority handling]; and diverted to ZZZ without any further incident. No injuries were sustained.
1900408,High Speed Abort; followed procedures; Kept on the RW; Made abort call to Tower.
1920052,It was a normal flight up to the point that the Cabin Altitude Warning Light and Horn went off. It was less than five seconds before we had O2 masks on. We established comms and then Captain began coordinating for lower altitude while I started a controlled descent based on the fact that the cabin altitude and cabin rate weren't pegged. While working through the QRC/QRH the pressurization stabilized while descending and we elected to level off at 26;000 feet instead of 19;000 feet; which was our clearance.With the cabin pressure returning to around 6;000 feet; we elected to stay on O2 for a little while longer to allow for faster recovery from hypoxia symptoms. Checked the weather in ZZZ (VMC) and confirmed fuel requirements and elected to continue to ZZZ basted on the time en route; fuel requirements and weather at the field. I had symptoms of hypoxia almost immediately; which included tingly skin; chest tightness; heavy arms; light headedness; and a sinus headache. Most symptoms subsided within 20-30 minutes; but the headache lasted for several hours. We landed without further incident at ZZZ.
1905659,Cancun possible taxiway incursion and FA injuryAfter pushback from gate; we were issued taxi instructions to taxi to 12L via B-C follow Aircraft X. First Officer (FO)  acknowledged the instructions and I read them back to him. We began a slow taxi as we elected to single engine taxi to the runway. Aircraft X we were told to follow was already well ahead of us. As we passed C7 the FO started the number one engine. FO stated the delayed engine start was complete. I turned right on E3 and continued to follow Aircraft X. As I made the turn I noticed an Aircraft Y pushing between us and Aircraft X we were following (maybe gate 54). Aircraft Y appeared to be stopping as we approached but then appeared to continue to push. It looked like there could have been a possibility of us being in their way and wasn't sure if the push crew could see us. None of Aircraft Y pushcrew seemed to be looking at us. At the same time ground called us and told us we were supposed to stop at E1 and call the other west ground to continue. I can assure you that I never heard this clearance given and neither did FO. This happened at the same time as I became very uncomfortable with the proximity of Aircraft Y. I applied firm brakes and stopped the airplane suddenly. I am not sure how fast I was going but believe I was going less than 10 kts.  The East Ground Controller told us to contact the West Ground. We did so.  The new Ground Controller issued us instructions to continue if we could maintain clearance. The wing walker from Aircraft Y assisted us by giving a thumbs up as we proceeded past Aircraft Y. The FO also mentioned that our wingtips were well clear of conflict.  I called the flight attendants and asked if everybody was ok. The Flight Attendant [FA] who answered said they were seated already for takeoff and ok. We took off shortly after that. About 15 minutes into the flight; I called the flight attendants and mentioned that it was all clear to get up as I briefed them to stay seated until I called due to the weather in the area. The lead [FA] called right back and said that when I abruptly stopped the airplane; FA was still up and securing the galley during the taxi and bumped her head and back.  The lead FA said FA was just going to stay seated for a while as she was not feeling well. The lead FA also mentioned that FA took some [medication].  I queried the lead FA if she or FA felt a need for MedLink. She assured me that was not necessary.  After a few minutes the lead FA called again and told me that FA got up and continued her duties. I spoke with FA later in the flight and she tried to assure me that she was ok but needless to say I feel completely responsible and terrible about the situation. I did not intend to stop the aircraft so quickly but did feel compelled to cause our aircraft to hit each other.  FA [and] the lead FA continued to assure me that she was fine and had no intention of reporting the issue.
1869214,Was flying from ZZZ to ZZZ1. Around 17 miles out I started my descent; when I pushed the mixture full forward the engine sputtered; then shut off. I tried adjusting the mixture and did some troubleshooting but could not get it started again. [Requested priority handling] with ZZZ1 TRACON and glided to ZZZ2; a private grass strip. My passenger was an A&P mechanic (we were flying to ZZZ1 to repair another plane so he had tools and parts onboard) and determined the cause of the failure was a faulty bolt connecting the mixture cable to the carburetor. The bolt released when I started my descent and shut the engine off. We were able to have the plane repaired on site and completed our flight to ZZZ1 later that day.
1925063,A few minutes prior to crossing the fix ZZZZZ; the Relief Pilot and the Relief Pilot Monitoring was asked by ATC if they would like a shortcut. The said yes and was given a direct to the fix ZZZZZ1. This caused our flight track to penetrate ZZZZ airspace and follow just north of the coast line. It appears we did not overfly any ZZZZ landmass. Around XX40Z the Relief Pilots called me in the bunk and when I came up to the cockpit; I was informed of what had happened.The Relief Pilots may have forgotten we cannot overfly ZZZZ with the [Hazmat] cargo we were carrying at the time.Better brief before departure emphasizing special cargo and the need to stay on flight plan to avoid overflying certain countries. Better brief of Relief Pilots reminding them of the need to stay out of certain airspace.
1929760,Configured and flying jump run. The left wing appeared to have lost lift causing a spin. Aircraft control was recovered within 5;000 ft. While the event was happening; a couple of jumpers left the aircraft upon which some skin damage occurred. Was able to land the aircraft safely with the jumpers that remained on board. We had a loss of lift on the left wing; so it has stalled. After speaking with the Company; we are going to run the jump run at a higher speed.
1898728,At FL 390; approximately 20 NM SE of ZZZ; ATC notified us of reports of moderate turbulence ahead. I had already asked the Flight Attendants to secure the cabin. The Passengers were seated with the Fasten Seat Belt sign on. I asked the Flight Attendants if they were seated and they said they were still securing the cabin. Shortly after that; moderate turbulence was encountered and I made a PA stating; 'Flight Attendants be seated; Flight Attendants be seated.'  Shortly after that; the PF (Pilot Flying) inquired if everyone was seated. I called the Flight Attendants to ask if everyone was seated. I was told by a Flight Attendant that 'Everyone is seated.' Shortly after that; we encountered severe turbulence for about 10 seconds. The aircraft rolled left then right about 30 degrees each way. We also had an updraft and downdraft; resulting in a loss of about 400 ft. altitude and a Mach overspeed of 0.82 for about eight seconds. PF regained control of aircraft quickly. ATC was contacted for a descent to FL 350.  Leveled off at FL 350.  I asked the Flight Attendants if everyone was ok and was told that the B FA (Flight Attendants) had minor injuries. I notified ATC of the severe turbulence and one minor Crew injury. I notified Dispatch of the same and requested EMS meet us at the gate in ZZZ.  Throughout the remainder of the flight; I periodically asked about the status of the B FA. A deadheading FA told me the B had been returned to her Jumpseat and had a sore hip and shoulder. We landed uneventfully in ZZZ. EMS met us at the gate and took the B FA to the hospital; accompanied by the deadheading FA. I was told later that B FA had no injuries other than soreness.  Flight Attendants should get seated and strapped in when a Pilot makes an announcement over the PA for them to be seated; as per the Pilot's [Maintenance Facility].
1897871,On the landing rollout in ZZZ; landing Runway XX; I saw a family of geese come out of the grass between the runway and taxiway. We were in the process of slowing to exit the Runway. The geese were initially moving from west to east across the runway but then turned north as they saw the airplane coming. I maneuvered the aircraft nose wheel slightly to the right of centerline to not hit the geese with the nose gear and I saw the geese go by down the left side of the airplane. They were all still on the ground at that time. I never saw them attempting to fly. I would estimate our speed as being around 50 kts. as we passed the geese and slowing.I notified Tower of the geese on the runway and that we might have struck them. We turned off the runway and turned south on [taxiway] to the gate. On the way past I could see at least 2 geese still on the runway just south of [taxiway]. We taxied to the gate. I did a thorough post flight inspection of the aircraft. I could not identify where on the aircraft we struck the geese. I notified Maintenance and Maintenance Personnel came and checked the aircraft as well and could not find signs of the bird strike. Airport Operations came to the aircraft and I spoke with them. They informed me that there were 4 geese found deceased on the Runway X full grown and 2 babies. One of the operations personnel was surprised by the lack of blood on the geese. I informed ZZZ Ground that we had observed no damage on the aircraft.
1917095,Ramp loaded mail listed on guidance sheet that had incorrect weight listed. Notified Ops and Load Planning after flight took-off.
1884662,At 1;500 feet AGL on final to ZZZ XXR I called for 'Landing checklist - below the line'. At 'Flaps' it was observed that the flap handle was at 30 but the flap position indicator displayed flaps 1.We elected to increase airspeed to the white caret on the airspeed indicator and proceed with the landing. We did not set the Ground Proximity Flap Inhibit switch to 'Flap Inhibit' which resulted in receiving the 'Too Low - Terrain' aural warning. The aircraft was on profile so we ignored the warning and landed normally; with a slightly longer than normal rollout.After touchdown the 'PSEU' (Proximity Switch Electronic Unit) light illuminated and the flaps moved to 30. We were able to raise the flaps after clearing the runway; subsequently the 'PSEU' light extinguished.Cause - We elected to land in lieu of going around in an aircraft with unknown possible flight control issues. Aircraft was on profile on a clear night with light winds and a long runway. The alternative was to take the aircraft back into the air to perform the QRH procedure and attempt an alternate flap extension procedure.Suggestions - This would be a useful training scenario.
1884539,While climbing out of ZZZ approximately FL200 the Captain mentioned his flight displays were flickering. Then approximately FL250 we had a L GEN FAIL EICAS along with associated load shed messages; the captain ran the QRH for the L GEN FAIL and power was restored. About a minute or two later; all the instruments started flashing as well flags on the round dials; both left and Center CRTs were flashing as well. The Captain turned off the left generator and all but the load shed items came back online. Once he started the APU the load shed items came back online also. We [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ.
1916886,Everything from the moment we got into the aircraft at the gate; and all the way up until just after the top of climb was normal. Everything was operating normally; some MELs; but we already knew about it. The Captain went to the lav; and the Flight Attendant took the open seat according to the Company's procedures. I showed her how far we had to go and how much time we have left on the PROG page on my FMS; then I noticed an amber indication off the left corner of my eye. I noticed the LP vibrations on the right engine was 4.0 amber. All other vibrations were no higher than 0.5 and green. The entire EICAS was full. Once the Captain returned I immediately showed him. He pulled out the QRH and we ran the Engine Abnormal Vibration checklist. QRH called to slow down .02 mach; so we did. Went from .78 to .76. No change; it went to green for a few seconds; but came back to amber. It also called to descend 2000 ft.; so we did. Went from FL330 to FL310. No change; it went to green for a few seconds; but came back to amber.Then we tried again going down to FL290 and slowed our airspeed. Again; no change; it went to green for a few seconds; but came back to amber. I cannot recall if we tried a third time; I think we did; but I do remember being at FL270. We tried reducing the power on the affected engine to maintain green LP vibrations and (if I recall) increasing the non affected engine. But we weren't able to maintain airspeed. I believe at this time we were around 230 kts. and decreasing. Up until this time; I was PF (Pilot Flying). CA (Captain) decided its safer to secure the affected engine and divert. I agreed. I believe we agreed upon a diversion airport before we shut the engine down. I thought ZZZ was a good option. It was one of our bases; also one of our maintenance bases too. It was ~180nm away. CA thought ZZZ1 was a better option since it was closer (~120nm). We then both agreed on ZZZ1. We checked the weather at ZZZ1 and it showed VFR. CA requested priority handling and we got vectored to ZZZ1. At this point we switched roles. I became PM (Pilot Monitoring) and he became PF. We did hand over the controls multiple times to assist each other in other tasks throughout the diversion/descent. Basically; anytime I was reading the checklist; I was PM. Anytime CA was making a call to the passengers and FAs (Flight Attendant) in the cabin; I would be PF. Right after CA [advised] ATC and got a vector to ZZZ1; we secured the affected engine. Next; I could not recall which order these were in; but we accomplished these tasks in the order of the QRH: I got our landing speeds from the shutdown checklist. CA notified Dispatch via ACARS. CA notified FAs. CA notified passengers. I had difficulty clearing out the flight plan by dragging the destination airport to the top. CA helped; but had difficulty too. It could be a bug in the planes computer; it's an older E170. I just deleted every fix by hand. It only took about 20 seconds.Multiple descent clearances and headings. Visual app and landing XXL.
1886405,Aircraft taxied beyond hold short point. Received taxi clearance to taxi to Runway 4R BOS. Clearance was taxi to [Runway] 4R via [Taxiways] E1; K; B; hold short of Juliet. Give way to [Aircraft Z] from your right. I read back clearance correctly; wrote it down; then read it again to the CA (Captain). I cleared him right after the [Aircraft Z] passed for his right onto [Taxiway] E1. I informed Ground we were awaiting numbers. Close out printed after turning onto [Taxiway] K and I informed Ground we had our numbers. I told CA I was heads down and entered numbers and briefed closeout. We checked flight controls on [Taxiway] K. I cleared him right onto [Taxiway] B and went heads down to complete the before take off flow and checklist. When I announced 'to the line' and performed that flow he said continue. We performed checklist below the line and announced before takeoff checklist complete. I heard [a] radio call [for us to] hold position. I responded to Tower and I looked up to see we were in the bend of Taxiway B and I asked CA if he had passed [Taxiway] Juliet. He said yes; and realized we'd gone past the hold short at [Taxiway] Juliet. [Aircraft Y] was told to go around and we were then cleared across [Runway] 4L and cleared for takeoff without further incident. The CA copied the taxi clearance that I repeated; but failed to write down the hold short of [Taxiway] Juliet instructions. We originally thought we would get [Runway] 33L due to performance and briefed that taxi on the departure briefing. We received [Runway] 4R as our runway with our push clearance. It was not on the ATIS for a departure runway. The taxi to [Runway] 4R was briefed but was a short taxi requiring a lot of heads down time for the FO (First Officer) due to delayed closeout numbers. I was not familiar with Boston having only been there a couple of times and did not know of the Non-standard position of the [Runway] 4L holdshort on [Taxiway] Bravo at [Taxiway] Juliet. There was a lot of aircraft taxiing in both directions adding another distraction. Taxiway Bravo does not cross the inner Runway 4L giving the impression one would not need to stop until reaching the hold short for [Runway] 4R. There are no hold bars or lights at [Taxiway] Juliet. [Suggest] Hold lights at the hold short on [Taxiway] Bravo at [Taxiway] Juliet when there is landing traffic on [Runway] 4L. Tower call for aircraft to hold short of [Runway] 4L on [Taxiway] Bravo at [Taxiway] Juliet for landing traffic after the handoff to them from ground on [Taxiway] Kilo.
1872393,On a stage 2 private check short field landing; my student landed and applied an unnecessary amount of braking which resulted in the airplane skidding and then our left tire blowing. I did call for flight controls once we started skidding but it was too late. Once the tire was blown I had controls and was able to keep the airplane from leaving the runway surface. Afterward we secured the aircraft; called the fbo to advise them we were stuck on the runway and to NOTAM it closed. Then I called Maintenance so they could come out and change our tire.Practice doing short field landings to full stops with students and emphasize braking should only be as necessary to stop in required distance while maintaining safety and positive aircraft control.
1920271,Aircraft X on walk around found right pack exhaust diffuser mount brackets broken. This will allow the diffuser to spin and cause the fan bypass check valve to stay open at all times which may cause a pack overheat and get a pack O/H light in the flight deck. See log page X. Aircraft taken out of service for repairs.
1887709,Flying the ORD7 departure; PEKUE fix; the FMS had PEKUE loaded twice. We did not catch it on the route briefing. We got to PEKUE and the aircraft tried to make a right turn to circle over PEKUE again. We caught it and the First Officer quickly TCS'd to stay on course until I could fix the FMS. ATC did not say anything to us. This issue happened the last time I flew the ORD7 to a different fix. We luckily caught it in the route briefing. My suggestion is do not load the ORD7 into the FMS. There is no need as this departure is strictly radar vectors. There are no RNAV tracks anywhere on this departure either. Loading it into the FMS does absolutely nothing. The initial fix is part of the flight plan; and the departure itself is not even listed on the release. There is a glitch in our FMS database that's allowing this to happen. We did not change departure runways or anything that would've caused this.
1874930,We received a TCAS RA while being vectored for the visual approach to Runway 36 at PIE. We were flying an assigned heading of 180 degrees and assigned speed of 170 knots when Tampa Approach advised us of traffic at our 12 o'clock and below. I was able to see the traffic on TCAS; but unable to visually acquire it. A moment later we received a TCAS RA to climb. We followed the advisory and climbed 300-400 feet at which time we received another advisory that we were clear of the conflict. I immediately advised ATC of the TCAS RA at which time the Controller instructed us to descend back to 3;000 feet. Tampa Approach had no further comment. I believe the conflict was caused by a VFR aircraft that was 500 feet below us; underneath the Class B and may have initiated a climb.
1926851,Was training a developmental on the R side. The developmental cleared Aircraft X off of ZZZ via the departure to 14000 ft. The clearance was relayed through flight data. The aircraft then departed what looked like Runway XX and was heading directly south towards RZZZZZ. The departure procedure was not followed by the pilot since they are only allowed to depart off Runway XY. I then instructed the aircraft below the MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude) to make a turn to the north I needed you to follow the departure. The aircraft was well below the MIA which is the reason for the report. Let the aircraft continue to do a pilot deviation and go into restricted areas.
1879333,Accepted an aircraft with a deferred aircraft pack and dispatched with one operating pack. While in cruise at FL340; the single operating pack did not maintain a cabin altitude below 10;000 ft. We followed the QRH and descended to 10;000 ft.I tried numerous times to contact Flight Control; but could not get anyone to answer. Next; I tried to contact Flight Control via ARINC; but received no answer. I was able to contact Company and asked them to relay to Company that we were diverting to ZZZ1. We landed without further incident. [I suggest] preventative maintenance. I was told by Maintenance after landing that the aircraft had a massive duct leak.
1882134,After a normal engine start; with the parking brake still set; both crew members were heads down in the cockpit. We were getting clearance and setting up the cockpit. We both felt movement of the airplane at the same moment and looked up and the plane had moved; we quickly got on the pedal brakes to stop the aircraft. There was a lineman that was near the nose of the aircraft giving us a stop sign for a moving aircraft. The aircraft came close to them and could have caused an incident without our quick reaction. We had no intention of moving at that time; and still did not move for a few moments after due to setting up the cockpit and the stop sign from the lineman. The parking brake was trusted to do its job; and was checked multiple times prior to start; but at that moment; it did not. The lessons learned: keep your feet on the brakes even when the parking brake is set in case the brake gives way; and one pilot should be heads up at all times. I plan to implement both of these moving forward.
1919275,Had to divert; descend from 31;000 ft. to 15;000 ft. Captain deployed masks in the cabin. Masks over right jumpseat didn't deploy. Purser informed me to don mask in the right E lavatory. The pressure was intense. My sinuses head and ears wanted to explode; the amount of pressure in the cabin. Captain unable to pressurize cabin.
1902524,Left engine vibration while at cruise altitude 9;000 MSL. Shut down engine; ran checklist for loss of power. Told ATC of my situation and diverted to ZZZ.
1918317,Material Logistic Specialist on duty in the ZZZ Warehouse Shipping Department was preparing material for the Load Device 3 can to ship to Company Maintenance Base. Material Logistic Specialist came across Airways Bill Parcel which is in a black hard sided case. The paperwork on the outside of the box was a hand written note that said send to [shop]. This shop is a Company shop. [The box had the address; Name and Vendor Number] on the repair order. This is not the appropriate paperwork to ship something. When Material Logistic Specialist opened the case she found a repair order # XXXXXXX that was shipped from ZZZ1 on Airway Bill XXX-XXXXXXXX to ZZZ. There was Hazmat paperwork with the shipment that had been generated. None of the repair order paperwork had a Hazardous Materials sticker attached. When I did some research I discovered that this cleared customs on Date and brought to the base by freight truck on that day [who] took the shipment to ZZZ Warehouse Receiving Dept where it would be sorted to where it would go or be received into inventory.
1910971,In the beginning of the take off roll we had a NO TAKE OFF EICAS Message and we rejected the take off. That light came on due to a rudder trim not aligned.
1928289,Climbing out of FL200 I noticed that the number 2 engine was not developing the same power as the other 3 engines. I checked the 3 engine optimum altitude and requested to level off at FL 260 which was approved. Within the next 50 minutes; the # 2 engine was producing less and less power until it was producing only idle power. I informed the Company that I would shut down the # 2 engine to prevent any further damage per the Quick Reference Handbook; Engine Limit or Surge or Stall checklist. The flight continued on the original route until the company requested that our flight divert to our maintenance base at ZZZ1. We accepted a new route to a fix over the ZZZZZ where we descended to FL150; entered holding and began fuel jettison. The fuel jettison worked normal for the first 60 tons dumped; but shut off prematurely and we could not jettison any more fuel per the procedure. We than had to lower the gear and extend flaps to increase the fuel burn while in the holding pattern to reach our maximum landing weight. Upon knowing that we could land safely under the max landing weight; we exited the hold and proceeded to make a normal approach and 3 engine landing. At block in; both the # 2 engine irregularities and fuel jettison irregularity were entered into the maintenance logbook. The flight crew of 4 worked well as a team; and the company dispatch gave us the appropriate information as we needed it.
1869248,My student began a descent from 6;500 feet MSL to ZZZ. Passing through 3;000 feet MSL; mixtures were placed full forward and fuel pumps turned on. When retarding the throttles lower than 15 inches of manifold pressure; the right engine failed; resulting in [requesting priority handling] with the tower and proceeding straight into Runway XX. After about 30-45 seconds with all engine controls in the full power position (throttle; propeller controls; and mixtures) the right engine started producing power again; but any power reduction below 15 inches of manifold pressure would cause the engine to sputter as if it would shut down again. Aircraft was brought over the runway and right engine power was only reduced once we were sure we could make the runway with no further incident. Once on the ground; the engine was able to maintain power with no further incident. Inspection of the bottom of the engine cowl by the cowl flap showed fresh oil that has been blowing backward under the wing. My student and I then removed the upper engine cowl; and saw no visible oil on the engine; magnetos; etc; but did see oil resting on the lower engine cowl inside the engine compartment.
1897945,I was conducting a training flight with a student at ZZZ when this occurred. We were conducting touch and go's on Runway XX. After a few laps in the pattern we were on the departure leg when I heard a radio call that a Yak aircraft was 3 NM southwest of the airport and that they were inbound to enter left traffic Runway XX at 2;000 ft. Very shortly after we made a radio call that we were turning left crosswind for Runway XX and began making the cross wind turn. We did not have visual contact with the Yak. Yak made a call that they had the 'departing traffic in sight'. We proceeded to make the downwind turn and radio call for Runway XX.Shortly after we turned downwind the Yak announced they were also turning downwind. At that point an ADS-B traffic advisory popped up our GPS. The ADS-B traffic showed the Yak at our 6 O'clock position at the same altitude and closing. Another pilot in the traffic pattern announced on CTAF that the Yak was right on top of us and use caution. At that point I announced on CTAF that I would be making a right 360 turn for spacing and that we would follow in behind the Yak.The Yak announced that they couldn't see us and thanked us for yielding to them. Immediately after; the Yak made a radio call that they too would be making a right 360 turn for spacing. It was at this point I decided the best course of action to avoid a collision would be to make a descending turn to the east and leave the airport environment. In doing so I descended to about 600 ft. MSL from the traffic pattern altitude of 868 ft. MSL and overflew some buildings at about 600 ft MSL. Once I heard the Yak was continuing in for landing I started climbing back to an appropriate altitude. We maneuvered back into the airport environment and landed without further issue.The problem arose by the Yak's non-standard pattern entry and decision to also perform a 360 degree turn in the pattern. Contributing factors: Our 152 is a high wing and the Yak is a low wing. The Yak may have associated our radio calls with a different aircraft in the pattern.
1911670,We were about 2 hrs into a 3 hour flight at FL410 when we noticed the left aft and fwd fuel pressure pumps lights both flashing on and off every couple seconds.  There was no associated Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System message at the time. As the situation progressed; the L AFT FUEL PUMP or the L FWD FUEL PUMP Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System message would display for about a second and then extinguish. The Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System message would display and then go out about a second later every five minutes or so. As a precaution; we elected to open up the cross feed lines to ensure there was adequate fuel pressure going to the left engine.We then discussed the situation and decided to descend to FL250 in order to improve our gravity/suction feed capability.  By the time we got down to FL250; we had about a 1;000 pound imbalance on the fuel from the cross feed. We elected to close the cross feed valve and both left fuel fwd and aft pressure lights began to flash again. We watched the fuel flow closely and there was no indication of a lack of fuel flow; which indicated to us that the engine was receiving adequate fuel pressure through what we assume was predominately gravity/suction feed. The fuel imbalance stayed around 1;000 pound. We had the Quick Reference Handbook for FUEL PUMP Press and FUEL SYSTEM PRESSURE out and ready to run.We referenced both checklist; but did not run them because the pumps were intermittently working still.  At this point; we were fairly close to ZZZ so elected to continue on ensuring we maintained situational awareness on runways nearby in the event the situation deteriorated or the left engine possibly flaming out. We declared a [priority] with ZZZ center and flew direct to the field for the visual to Runway XXC. As we passed through about 3;000 feet on vectors; the left fuel pump pressure lights stopped flashing and we landed uneventfully.
1898723,Aircraft X (CRJ9) was inbound to ZZZ airport for the visual approach to Runway XX and I issued a descent to 3000 ft.; which was read back by Aircraft X. Simultaneously; Aircraft Y was inbound on the final approach course for the visual approach to Runway XX at ZZZ; with unidentified VFR aircraft maneuvering on the Runway XX final approach course. As I was monitoring Aircraft Y's position on final with regard to the maneuvering VFR aircraft on final; Aircraft X proceeded to descend through his assigned altitude of 3000 ft. to 2000 ft. I issued Aircraft X a low altitude alert. Aircraft X advised he was in the climb to 2500 ft.; and advised if I wanted to issue higher. I then issued Aircraft X 3000 ft. As Aircraft X was vacating 2000 ft. I issued a vector below the MVA; to turn him towards ZZZ airport. That same vector also put Aircraft X toward a minimum vectoring altitude sector of 3000 ft. I had anticipated Aircraft X to have a greater climb rate in order to comply with the MVA and to start his turn above the MVA altitude. In order to protect controllers and aircraft from the Minimum Vectoring Altitude change adjacent to ZZZZZ1; maybe an outline of the area can be made as selectable map.
1925227,I was assigned to work Aircraft X; an Airbus 319. The aircraft had been written up more than 4 times in 7 days for inability to control cockpit and cabin temperature while in flight - the cabin and cockpit were getting too warm. In some cases over 90 degrees. The aircraft had an MEL'd Pack 1. On the inbound leg; before I got the airplane on Date; it was again written up for hot cabin in flight; and the Flight Attendants on the inbound said the aft cabin was extremely warm and never cooled down while in flight. Maintenance came out and turned on Pack 1; cooled the cabin; and signed off the logbook. I questioned the Technician on what corrective action he took; and he explained he turned on the MEL'd pack; cooled the cabin; and signed off the book; but that because there was so much history with the issue; Maintenance Control was not authorizing the removal of the MEL'd pack without further investigation. I pointed out that I can't use an MEL'd item in flight; and the issue is not the cabin being warm on the ground. It's that it is getting too warm in flight. He agreed; but said he couldn't remove the MEL. So there was no corrective action taken in regards to the repeat issue. He told me Maintenance Control was asking me if I wanted to take the airplane. I called Maintenance Control; and was advised that if I refused the airplane; they could then fix it. Since we were going to ZZZ1; with a full flight and many of them older adults who would likely not do well in a hot; possibly 90 degree plus cabin for 2.5 hours; and with no fix available to the actual problem; I refused the airplane. As we were getting off the airplane; they had assigned the aircraft to another crew to work a different flight. I saw the Captain in the gate area and explained to him that I had refused the aircraft and why. He also subsequently refused the aircraft. The operation is stretched so thin; that there is no time to fix airplanes and instead they are being pressed into service with repeat issues; that are not being addressed. Not until pilots refuse them are they able to get fixed. It felt like Maintenance Control was almost saying - we want to fix it but we aren't being allowed...unless you refuse it. Then we will be allowed to fix it. Although clearly they tried to get another crew to fly the airplane before it was also subsequently refused. It's frustrating that a corrective action can actually not fix the problem. Cooling down the cabin on the ground wasn't the issue - the airplane was too hot in flight - repeatedly. It's also frustrating that pilots have to refuse airplanes to get them fixed; even if they try and get another crew to fly the airplane first. I also think the company should have to inform a Captain if the airplane was previously refused by a crew. Maintenance should have the ability to say that they are taking the airplane out of service since it has extensive history of an issue.
1913323,I; Name; ZZZ Line Mechanic; called Maintenance Control Name 1 to placard the ATSU (Air Traffic Service Unit) on MEL 46-XX ATA 46-YY on Date at ZZZ Airport; Aircraft X. I did not know that the aircraft had a previous MEL 46-ZZ under ATA 23-AA.On aircraft equipped with ATSU; the MEL 46-ZZ under ATA 46-YY is normally used. The aircraft in ZZZ1 airport was MEL using ATA 23-AA instead of ATA 46-YY. As a result; I only checked the 30 days history for ATA 46-YY. Consequently; the aircraft did not make a successful flight after the last repair and I should have had reopened the previous MEL under ATA 23-AA instead of creating a new one.When placing a MEL on an aircraft equipped with an ATSU; the MEL 46-XX ATA 46-YY should be used. However; I will look at both ATA 46 and ATA 23 history in the future to be sure nothing gets missing.
1894412,During approach; radio altimeter did not activate until 1500 ft. AMSL; indicated 1400 ft.; shot up to 2000 ft.; returned to normal operation at 1400 ft.
1914340,After landing we were to taxi and Taxiway Alpha hold short of Echo. We accidentally held short of Foxtrot Taxiway. The Taxiway signs looked like they were co-located. Ground told us of our mistake and then to taxi to the Gate. Also next time follow their instructions. Taxiway signs are co located and paint on ground has faded. Taxiway Echo is the size of a small road and doesn't look like a Taxiway. Don't pay attention to the signs on the Ground that are painted. Also; a better briefing on the entrance and Taxiway surrounding the Ramp would be appropriate.
1866560,Due to wake turbulence from a preceding aircraft and prevailing winds we elected to offset two miles to the left of track to keep us clear of the moderate turbulence. I had forgotten that SLOPing left of course is not authorized per the FOM. Sometime later; while I was on break; Gander Oceanic queried us as to why we were showing left of course and the Relief Pilot and First Officer corrected the error and returned to the center of the track. (SLOPing right of course would've put us back into the wake turbulence.)
1896644,I was 10 miles to the NW to enter the pattern at ZZZ. There was a PC-12 who had called for Tower and many people told him that Tower was closed and there was an active NOTAM for Tower being closed. The runway in use was Runway XX at ZZZ; so my student and I proceed to enter on the 45 for the left downwind for Runway XX. I make a 10;7;5 and 3 mile call out saying that I will enter the left downwind for Runway XX. I proceed to enter the left base for Runway XX. At this moment the only traffic I am aware of is airplanes entering the pattern because they were talking on CTAF. My student then proceeds to turn final. We landed on the 1000 footers and as I look up I see the PC-12 landing on Runway XY. The PC-12 performs a go around. I queue up on CTAF telling everyone not to land because of the PC-12. After this happened the pilot of the PC-12 queues up on CTAF finally making traffic calls. He admitted to the being on the wrong frequency. After I landed and the PC-12 had landed I confronted the Pilot and he had no remorse for what just happened. The PC-12 had 6-8 passengers on board.
1917476,We did the appropriate paperwork and prepared to depart ZZZ for ZZZ1. Picked up our clearance and departed. At some point in the climb we became aware of an odor distinctly that of gasoline. After discussing the notable lack of HAZMAT paperwork and the implications of such an odor we made the decision to turn around. Re-briefed the approach and our plan; called ZZZ Center and requested direct to the IAF for the ILS which we then performed as normal. After arriving back at the airport we opened the cargo door to inspect the cargo and locate the culprit. Upon doing so we discovered a shipment of gas cans (Jerry Jugs) that had not been cleaned properly. We removed them; searched the rest of the load for anything else that we should have been notified of its presence; removed what we could find; and redid the weight and balance. Filed a new flight plan; and departed once more for ZZZ1. The rest of the flight went without incident. A company mandated return report was filed with the appropriate operational personnel.
1906763,Towards the end of boarding B FA (Flight Attendant) asked if I smelled anything unusual aft of the aircraft; I didn't; we waited some more. B FA had communication with flight deck and said that there was a smell aft of the aircraft. I then moved to the left aft of the aircraft to see if I could notice it and did; B FA and I thought it was coming from air vents on top ably everything jump seats. Then pilots made an announcement to let passengers know we might have to deplane; then when we did deplane; maintenance happened.
1911710,It was the First Officer's leg to fly; ZZZ-ZZZ1. Aircraft X. Taking off of Runway XX in ZZZ; our assigned heading for the SID was a right turn of 340. On climbout the First Officer noted abnormal function of the flight controls during the right turn. He gave me the flight controls and I verified that the yoke would not turn right more than 1/4 scale deflection before jamming up. Flight controls were transferred back to the first officer so that I could run checklists and coordinate with ATC; Dispatch; and the Flight Attendants. We elected to discontinue the flight and initially told ATC we were going to return to ZZZ in order to keep us close to the airport while we came up with a plan. The airplane was overweight by about 4;000 lbs. and with the combination of that and the flight control malfunction we decided to divert to ZZZ1 for the longer runways. APU was turned on to burn off fuel. I advised Dispatch and the Flight Attendants. The Flight Attendants made an announcement for me because I was task saturated and they were advised that they had 10-15 minutes to prepare the cabin and that no brace command was needed at that time.The overweight landing QRH was ran. The First Officer flew the RNAV GPS X Runway XXL into ZZZ1 and it was clearly visible that the yoke was jamming anytime he put in for right aileron. Touchdown was smooth and descent rate at landing was 100-140 FPM. Emergency vehicles were standing by and we were able to taxi to the gate as a non-event. Aileron jamming was unable to duplicate once we were on the ground.This aircraft had been written up multiple times for the same issue. We were unable to duplicate issue with the yoke on the ground. I would suggest taking it for a flight to duplicate and fix.
1932538,Aircraft X was landing VNY and there were heavy/extreme precipitation east and west of PMD. I received the aircraft at 140 then descended the aircraft to 080 told the pilot deviations lefts are approved when able direct UMBER. Aircraft deviated too far left into a 090 MVA level at 080. I noticed it right when he got into the 090 MVA block and turned and climbed the aircraft to 090. No recommendations just make sure to check the MVA around your aircraft when deviating.
1904979,I just sat down and taken radar on multiple aircraft. My original thought with the PC12 was to get them down into my airspace while staying out of finals airspace. I also needed to keep them above the restricted area which was active to 3500 ft. When the PC12 called I went back to my original thought. In my scan I thought they were further north in 3800 ft. MVA. So I mistakenly descended them to 4000 ft. At this time I had multiple aircraft calling up with request along with other controllers. Which caused me to get distracted enough to not realize and fix my mistake before it was an issue. While I was in the middle of answering calls another controller reached out to make me aware of the situation. So at this point I issued a climb to 5000. A low altitude alert would have helped.
1867184,I was approaching to land at ZZZ; an airport I have flown to only during the day a few times; from the Southeast on a night with a Waxing Crescent moon. Not much moonlight being available. The course that I previously plotted for entering the airspace heading to the airport on Foreflight was close to directly over ZZZ1. This was purposely chosen to avoid the high terrain close to the 130 radial from ZZZ2 that I noted during planning. Once I made contact with the Tower frequency; I was instructed to enter a right base for Runway XXR. I had a descent rate that allowed me to get fairly close to the pattern altitude as I was entering the airspace; which put me on a collision course with the high terrain. I did not notice it in the moment; as I was scanning outside for traffic and beginning to prepare the aircraft to land. As I was scanning outside; I noticed that I was beginning to lose sight of the south part of the Airport. I moved my eyes around a bit more; and could just faintly see the outline of a dark mountain in front of me (which ended up being about a mile and a half out in front). I quickly applied full power and banked slightly right to change my course; which was more than enough to almost immediately regain sight of the Airport and avoid the terrain.I did notice that this dark terrain was close to the horizontal path of Runway XY; which could be dangerous for VFR aircraft approaching the airport from this direction too. I was able to get back on base and make a normal landing. There are many small things that led up to this situation occurring. I did correctly note this high terrain in preflight planning; but I personally failed to keep it in mind as I was preparing to land and could not easily visually see it until I was very close to it. This situation could have been fully avoided by flying in to the airport airspace from around the 080 to 100 radials; or even from a more northern course. I could have also planned to reach pattern altitude closer to the airport; rather than aiming to be at it upon entry to the airspace (unlike what I have been used to with airports that have usually flat terrain around them). From what I remember; the obstacle database in this airplane has not been updated in a long time. However; having the top of the terrain lit up somehow could have also greatly helped in avoiding it from afar visually in very dark conditions such as this night. I have personally learned a lot from this situation with pre-flight planning along with noting obstacles along the way (visually seen and checking all tools available to make sure I am clear on my path in conditions where I may not be able to see as well). I will now consider filing instrument flight plans or just simply not fly in dark conditions to destinations within mountainous terrain areas to totally avoid situations like this.
1869594,While performing a practice ILS to Runway 1L at ADW; the Radar Altimeter sweep twice to 250 ft. The practiced ILS was performed coupled and had engaged at the final approach fix. The sweep occurred approximately 3.5 miles from the end of the runway. The helicopter was about 1000 ft. AGL then swept down to 250 ft. AGL. Stabilized for a second then returned to the correct altitude. Then it swept a second time. This sweep of the Radar Altimeter did not effect the helicopter controls.
1917561,Heading 260; vectored off of the Muscle Arrival into MSP with cumulonimbus clouds I observed a drone of the nose of the aircraft. It was slightly north of the aircraft and appeared to curve south and flew approximately 300 ft. off past our left wing. It was predominantly black with some red on it. It was difficult to obtain the size and shape due to the crossing speed; but it seemed round and was around a meter long. We did not take evasive action but did report it to the MSP TRACON. It maintained co-altitude with us the entire time.
1884838,FA's (Flight Attendants) needed to remove and check 7-8 bags from the aircraft; since we ran out of OHB space. FA's brought the bags to the boarding door. Unfortunately; the Agents did not ask any customer about spare lithium batteries being in their bags; as all the Customers were seated. There were no conversations with any of the passengers and their checked bags and the bags simply were tagged and sent to the ramp. This is not good as this created a safety hazard. Please ensure all Team Members follow procedure; most especially when it pertains to safety-related items and the integrity of the aircraft; as it did in this case. Friendly and continuous reminders are always helpful. In hindsight; I wish I would have informed the Captain about this at the time; but there was a lot going on: we had all these bags saturating the galley; it was near departure time; I had to go brief OWE's (Overwing Emergency Exit); etc. However; I'm not sure if that would have changed anything in the end anyway. I really truly wish we all were aware of procedures and followed procedures even when it might be inconvenient or we miss departure time. It is very difficult and challenging to confront Team Members asking them to follow procedure when we really shouldn't be having to ask them to; we should all know procedure and follow it without question instead of taking the easy way out. I share this with your Team in confidence: I did receive some pushback from a fellow FA when I mentioned asking those 7-8 passengers to go to the boarding door with their bags. I hope this remains confidential. Perhaps this is a good opportunity for us to remind each other of the need to always follow procedure regarding bags that need to be removed from the cabin due to lack of OHB space; most particularly on the A319/320 aircraft where space is always limited. I can't do everything myself :( Thank you for your continued help and support. Please let me know how I can help you as well.
1909357,We were to take Aircraft X to ZZZ from ZZZ1; the aircraft had a maintenance issue; the issue was said to be fixed in ZZZ1. In ZZZ1 when the engines were turned on my crew and I sensed and awful smell of vomit; we mentioned to the flight deck; the Captain said that was a normal smell since they were doing a fuel engine balance and oil check; so the smell was expected. During cruise to ZZZ the smell of vomit; mold and poop all combined persisted. We land in ZZZ; we tell the Captain about the smell and he said that was normal. Next day; we take the same aircraft; Aircraft X to ZZZ1 from ZZZ. When the engine started on the ground the smell in the cabin was just awful. The aircraft smelled dirty; like moldy; vomit; old cheese; poop what ever nasty smell you can think of; the aircraft smelled just like it. We again told the Captain and he said that was the smell that should be expected because the aircraft had the same problem. During cruising to ZZZ1; The smell became worse; it was so bad that my other crewmate FA4 (Flight Attendant) and I FA2 had to find a face mask to just bear the awful smell. I became nauseous; got a headache; and a burn and heavy sensation on my chest; all of the passengers that were sitting at the back of the airplane were complaining about the smell. Mind that myself being FA 2; I had to set up carts and prepare for a beverage service; consequently I was moving the most and since I was exercising; I believe that I was taking deeper breaths and the results was that I was mostly affected. However; since the Captain has been saying the whole time that the smell was expected; we seized to mentioned the problem. We landed at ZZZ1. The Captain doesn't say anything until I see two Mechanics onboard when we were deplaning. The Captain finally says that we had an oil leakage with a fume event during cruise and that he was having a hard time accessing his tablet to figure out the procedures. The First Officer complained the his throat was itchy; along with the other crew FA4. No one from the company showed up to ask if we were okay. I go directly to my manager to tell her what happens; she recommends that I go to the hospital. I get punished by the company with a sick call for going to the hospital because we still had two flights to work on. Three days later; I go to the hospital again with my joints hurting; headaches; and tiredness with inconclusive results with my white cells all out of whack; but not a sign of infection or virus. The flight deck along with the flight crew need extensive training about procedures and how to concretely recognize fume and odor event in the cabin. The flight deck also need extensive training and to listen to their cabin crew and to not put their personal needs before the cabin crew members and their passengers since the flight deck wear oxygen masks at all times. We; the cabin crew along with the paying passengers can occur health consequences with the dismissiveness; lack of procedural knowledge of the flight deck which in this case happened to us the cabin members and the passengers. I just hope that our passengers are okay and no adverse reaction occurred to their health since they have no knowledge of the event.
1891894,Aircraft X had a low speed rejected takeoff for takeoff configuration status message for rudder trim. I mistakenly did not realize that it was a Company event and they needed return to the gate for a rudder trim inspection; due to the rudder trim being at fault.Maintenance Operations Manager made we aware of the event and we tried to stop the aircraft from taking off; but we were unable to get them on ACARS in time.I was unaware that it was a Company event and I was reading the QRH CRJ-700 with the crew and the note said NOTE:After any RTO (Rejected Takeoff) greater than 80 knots; the crew must seek approval to continue from a Chief Pilot; Fleet Manager or Director of Operations.The best method to facilitate this communication is through Dispatch.All RTOs will be documented with a Safety Report. The speed that the crew said was only 50 knot when they performed the rejected takeoff.My mistake was just consulting the QRH and not the GMM (General Maintenance Manual) for the definition of a [event].
1880144,After departure; since this was the first time I had seen a [Dangerous Goods] form; I asked the Captain about the inclusion of the HAZMAT information on the Flight Release.
1867532,We were on a normal approach to Runway XXR in ZZZ. When we attempted to select flaps 25; the FLAPS TE DISAGREE EICAS illuminated and the flaps stayed at 20. We went around from approximately 1;000 ft. AGL and I ran the non-normal procedure while the FO (First Officer) flew the aircraft as were vectored back for a visual approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ. We completed the non-normal checklist; sent a quick ACARS message to Dispatch; talked briefly to the flight attendants to tell them we were landing very soon; and made a flaps 20 landing. Per ZZZ Maintenance; we left the flaps at 20 and wrote up the malfunction at the gate.
1915703,Climbing out of ZZZ on vectors between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 we got an EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) message FLT CNTRL/SPOILER ASYM. The F/O (First Officer) ran the NON-NORMAL CHECKLIST. Checklist said to land at nearest suitable airport. We considered dumping fuel; but we elected to land overweight considering the buffet in the controls and the fact dumping would take approximately 45 minutes. I was not comfortable taking more time considering the flight controls did not feel normal. On approach when the speed brake was armed we lost 5 knots on our VREF Speed. Aircraft had a shutter and rolled slightly to the left. I told the F/O to add power. He did and made a beautiful landing. The trucks were standing by. Dispatch and [maintenance] were consulted and notified.
1895896,Cabin pressure controller malfunction in-flight resulting in a cabin pressure reaching approx 8500 ft. We advised ATC and leveled off at FL230. We ran the QRH procedure which had us use normal mode. Normal mode was not effective and the cabin pressure continued to climb slowly. Upon reaching 9500 ft. of cabin altitude with approx 4 psi differential pressure; we initiated a descent and [advsied ATC]. Upon reaching 10;000; we coordinated with Dispatch and ATC then continued to ZZZZ. The cabin stabilized at approximately 2000 with the aircraft at 10;000 msl. We completed the QRH procedure and dumped the cabin pressure and continued the approach and landed without incident.
1900237,While doing the post flight walk around in ZZZ; the First Officer; Name; was notified by ramp personnel of a dent on the aircraft. He reported this to me and we both went out to inspect it. Although the dent was very small; it was there; and he must have missed it in his preflight. There were no markings anywhere around the dent that would be evidence of a previous write up and when comparing the DMIs (Deferred Maintenance Item) listed in the deferred log index; there were no write-ups that matched this dent either. So I made a logbook entry and called maintenance. This was the last flight of the day for the aircraft so I bypassed dispatch and called maintenance directly. I spoke with Name1 in maintenance and gave him the description of the dent. He informed me that they keep a longer list of previously reported and DMI dents that I don't have access to. Within a few seconds he found one the he thought matched it and he described the previously reported dent almost verbatim to how I had explained it to him. I thought it was strange that the dent was described almost identical to how I described it to him. I told him that I had already logged the entry in the AFML (Air Frame Maintenance Log) and he said that was fine; I could just void it. I told him I didn't feel comfortable voiding an entry that I had no way of seeing that it was previously written up for myself. While still on the phone; Name1 said to another technician in the background something along the lines of ' I have a pilot that doesn't want to do his job'. The other person told him to send me to the Duty Pilot. Before he even had a chance to say anything; I told him I would be more than happy to speak to the Duty Pilot. I felt like they were trying to intimidate me into clearing this entry. I was transferred to Name2; the Duty Pilot; and told him the situation. I told him I didn't feel comfortable clearing an entry just because Maintenance told me to without having access to this other book of previously reported DMIs. He told me that we do in fact keep another list of DMIs and that it's our policy to just clear the entry if we are told by maintenance that it's previously reported. He stated I need to have more trust with maintenance and that trust is in our guiding principles. I asked why they couldn't just have contract maintenance clear the entry as previously reported and he stated that contract maintenance was expensive. I reluctantly voided the entry. I had Maintenance and the Duty Pilot telling me to do so and I felt like the dent was insignificant and in my opinion; no safety threat. I immediately regretted doing this as I didn't believe that was the right way of handling the situation. If Maintenance is the one with access to this other book; I felt like they should be the ones to clear the entry. That way they are signing their name to the AFML; attesting that they confirmed it was previous damage and not new damage. I feel if their name was connected to that statement; they wouldn't be so nonchalant about it.While waiting for the van I ran this situation by one of our senior check airman that I greatly respect. He felt the same way I did and didn't think it was my responsibility to void the entry. I decided to call the Assistant Chief Pilot; Name3; to talk to him about it. Much to my surprise; Name3 immediately took the side of Maintenance and the Duty Pilot. He said much of the same things Name 2; the Duty Pilot; said but also said that as long as I follow the direction of Maintenance; on a recorded line; I remove responsibility from myself. I still didn't like it and continued to think about it. Although I hadn't mentioned this to anyone yet; I really didn't trust Name1; the original maintenance guy I spoke with. He came to the conclusion way to quickly that this was previous damage without asking very many questions at all and he described it to me almost verbatim as I had described it to him. He stated it was item #2 of what I believe he called'the dent an ding logbook'. At this point I had been at the hotel for about an hour and decided to call maintenance back. I spoke with Name4. I asked him if it was possible to get a copy of the dent and ding logbook page for item #2. This is what Name1 had said was the same dent that I had written up. I figured if I could see it for myself; I could rest easier. He agreed to this and emailed a copy of the page while I was still on the phone with him. Within seconds he realized that this was not the same dent that I had described based on the location. He looked for another possible entry and I sent him the pictures that I had taken. He sent me dent #8 in the logbook and it was quite obvious that this was also not the dent I had written up and then cleared. I realized this was a legitimate maintenance issue that I was talked into voiding it out by not only maintenance but the Duty Pilot and Assistant Chief Pilot. I informed Name4 that I was heading back to the airport to write it up again.There was a contract maintenance guy at the aircraft already mapping it out by the time I arrived. I added a second discrepancy worded the same as the voided entry and notified Operations. I believe the motivation to sweep this under the rug was financial and it's very concerning that the Duty Pilot and Assistant Chief Pilot were so quick to back up maintenance with little to no investigation on their end. I too am concerned with helping the company keep cost down but money should never overshadow safety. If Maintenance; the Duty Pilot and Assistant Chief Pilot are willing to pressure me; a Senior Captain and Instructor; they are definitely going to do this to junior captains. I feel this type of mindset is a safety problem and I wanted to make sure it is brought to light.
1907613,During cockpit flow; hydraulic systems pages appeared within normal quantity. Thirty minutes into the flight we received a HYD 2 LO QTY. The HYD 2 LO QRH was run. The quantity was at 16%; pressure 2;900 psi; and temperature around 28C. Upon contacting Dispatch and Maintenance via AIRINC; the decision was initially made to continue to ZZZ1 due to a suspected faulty sensor. During the discussion the HYD 2 quantity slowly fell to 0%. Roughly 5 minutes after the quantity was at 0% the HYD 2 pressure dropped from 2;900 psi slowly to 2;500 psi and then rapidly to 0 psi. At this point; Maintenance was in agreement that the HYD 2 SYS was lost. The decision was made to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ.Shortly after HYD 2 LOW PRESS EICAS appeared and corresponding QRH was completed. [Cabin Crew] was informed of the situation and code yellow. Customers were informed of the problem and of a return to ZZZ with roughly 20 minutes remaining in flight. During the descent with FO (First Officer) flying; the aircraft was configured at 300 kts.; autopilot on; descending through mid twenties at 2;000 FPM; on LNAV with a straight course. The aircraft was rolled sharply in an uncommanded right roll of 5-15 degrees. This occurred twice. AP TRIM MISMATCH was displayed and FO ran appropriate QRH. At this point the decision was made to hand fly the arrival and I took control to allow FO to review QRH and special considerations for landing. Aileron trim was used to compensate roll with maximum trim roughly 1.5 ticks to the right. Sudden unannounced rolls continued with the last being at around 200 ft. AGL. HYD SYS page was continuously monitored and it appeared rolls were linked to a surge in PSI which ranged from 0-1;000 psi. We had an uneventful flaps full landing on XXL. The left engine TR (Thrust Reverser) was deployed. Directional control was not a problem. Around 40 kts.; brake pressure increased unexpectedly and the aircraft jolted. Aircraft came to stop on XXL. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) inspected brake temperatures which were 260/30 30/460+. CFR cleared aircraft to be towed to Gate XX. Customers deplaned uneventful.
1906922,We landed on Runway 19 at MEI and during the left turn off the runway the Tower instructed us to exit at [Taxiway] Alpha 3 and left on [Taxiway] Bravo. We were abeam or past the taxiway sign for [Taxiway] Bravo so we continued straight ahead to the old now closed Taxiway Bravo. The Tower instructed us to stop and do a U-turn to the new [Taxiway] Bravo. We were not the first crew to have done this as I could see recent tire tracks and a broken taxi light on the old [Taxiway] Bravo. I have two suggestions. First; on the taxi chart we reviewed prior to landing the XXXX on the closed taxiway are faint. They do not stand out. They in fact are considerably less distinct than the oddly depicted airport perimeter fence or road. Why is the perimeter fence/ road on the chart? My second suggestion is wouldn't a sign or clear barricade prohibiting entry onto the old [Taxiway] Bravo be better. There is a yellow X on the ground but by the time you see it you are already on the taxiway with not much of a option to turn around. Lastly the entire issue could have been avoided if the Tower had said; exit at [Taxiway] Alpha 3 and make the 'FIRST' left onto [Taxiway] Bravo. That one additional word would have saved us all.
1884132,I noticed a slight chemical smell during taxi. On takeoff and during climb the smell became very strong. I spoke with the Captain and he stated that he and the First Officer could also smell it in the cockpit. The decision was made to return to ZZZ.
1903057,I am writing this report because I am deeply concerned about fatigue and the crisis that is upon us. I never thought this would be an issue at (Company); but here we are. Decades ago I flew for a Regional Airline that operated under the assumption that FAA limits were normal operating procedure. They didn't recognize that FAA limits should be viewed as the boundary; not the normal way of operating. Unfortunately; decades later (Company) is doing the same thing that lousy Regional Airlines did. Most Pilots at this Regional could not wait to get out of there for this reason. The best way to describe FAR 117 to anyone that isn't a Pilot is to associate it to food. FAR 117 is the same as really really bad food. It's the kind of food you eat out of desperation; because it's better than starving; however; it's awful. Once in a while; sure I get it; I need to eat it. However; we are at a point where Crew Scheduling is handing out bad food on a regular basis. There is only so much bad food we are willing to eat before we seek out a better alternative; and that is called fatigue. Example; just this weekend I was scheduled to fly a 12 hour 55 minute duty day after a 12 hour overnight. When the Scheduler gave me this whopper (normal these days); I told him that many things had to go right for this day to go as planned; considering I only had 35 minutes of leeway before I became illegal. His response? It's legal; we will deal with it if it doesn't work out. Well; it failed miserably. We landed in ZZZ1; just prior to a thunderstorm and of course I became illegal to fly my last leg. Their solution? Deadhead on that flight; which the aircraft had diverted; so there was no telling how long it would be before that flight pushed. About 4 hours later; while waiting for this flight; they called again and said I was illegal to deadhead. Now they wanted me to go to the hotel for another 11 hour overnight after being on duty for 13 plus hours. I asked for a later deadhead the next day so I could recover from this beast of a day; and the response again was its legal; we don't have to do that.  It took arguing with a Supervisor for them to understand why I wanted a longer overnight. I was fatigued and I knew that the next day I would probably be asked to fly instead of deadhead and 11 hours of rest wasn't going to cut it. They finally conceded and I got a longer overnight. This is the fourth time in the last two months where scheduling has tried to back me into a corner and I have called fatigue. There are Pilots out there who are just doing what Scheduling is asking them to do and there is no way it's a Safe operation. I hope whoever reads this; sounds the alarm over at Crew Scheduling. The Company claims we are calling fatigue and sick too much; yet if the Company doesn't change its Crew Scheduling process; the problem will only get worse. Summer is coming.
1877870,After taking off from ZZZ-ZZZ1; we were not able to retract the landing [gear]. At around 35 feet with positive rate after calling for gear up; I tried to put the landing gear lever in the up position and was unsuccessful. We notified ATC and told them what had happened and that we wanted to level off at 3;000 feet and get some vectors so we can complete our required checklist. We ran the QRH and decided to return to ZZZ because there was no (LG WOW SYS FAIL MESSAGE DISPLAYED) so the QRH directed us to land at the nearest suitable airport. We completed the QRH and notified Dispatch of our intentions. We also briefed the flight attendants and passengers about the current situation. We never [requested priority handling] or gave any brace commands because the QRH never called for it and furthermore everything was under control and completely safe. While returning back to ZZZ; I suggested that we held for a few minutes to burn off some fuel and avoid an overweight landing. Once we were below max landing weight; we decided to contact ATC for the ILS XX. We landed without any further incident. On the ground we informed Dispatch and Maintenance Control of what occurred and Maintenance responded that they already knew because their system indicated there was something wrong with the nose wheel sensor. We briefed the Gate Agent and passengers and told them that there will be a replacement aircraft landing soon. After we swapped aircraft we departed without any further incident.
1894559,On Date 1 I sent out shipments to ZZZ. I don't remember all of the work that I processed. I was extremely ill and I went home at XA:00 on Date 2. I don't recall any hazmat labeled boxes. I was showed on the company report that I shipped out 1 of 3 printers on the screen and one of the printers was not a printer.
1934103,After departure we saw that the rpm was less than 2200 RPM and the climb rate was less than 200 FPM. Due to that situation; we decided to turn back to join the traffic pattern and land back at the airport. After we landed; the engine was almost about to quit on the landing ground roll. We taxied back to the company ramp and squawked the airplane for maintenance inspection.
1914797,On final approach the First Officer (FO) thought he saw a drone. I never saw it. And he couldn't give me any good description of what it looks like (it went by so fast). We told the tower so the next aircraft would be informed.
1888589,After block in at ZZZ the Lead Flight Attendant came up to the Flight Deck and said we had a pretty strong Odor coming from the Forward Gallery area that smelled like jet fuel. She said the Odor began just before we lowered the landing gear on approach into ZZZ and dissipated as we were taxiing to the gate. Both Flight Attendants described the order as being 'Strong and a bit irritating'. Maintenance Control was then notified; and logbook entry was made as well as a Fume/Odor report. A mechanic was quick to meet us at the gate and was briefed.
1893908,At 7;000 ft. MSL; heading assigned 250 degrees to intercept [Runway] 17R final approach course and cleared for visual approach 17R; I intercepted final and descended to 6;000 ft. MSL prior to Joule which is not below [the] floor of Class B but below MVA. ATC alerted us MVA was 6;500 ft. I climbed back to 6;500 ft. and intercepted GS and proceeded visually with the approach and uneventful landing. TDZE at DEN 17R is 5;392 ft. MSL. Weather conditions were VMC (clear skies' light winds from the East).
1889004,I was the Pilot in Command. I was going to conduct a solo cross country from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 to ZZZ3 and return to ZZZ1. I conducted my pre-flight check in accordance with the Pilot's Operating Handbook. I did not discover any issues. I then contacted ZZZ1 Ground Control and requested and was approved for my run-up. I proceeded to the north end of Alpha 1 to conduct my run-up. I conducted my run-up in accordance with the POH and again did not discover any issues. I had no difficulty in taxing from the FBO to the run-up area. I obtained clearance from ZZZ1 Ground Control to proceed to Runway XX and hold short. I again did not experience any difficulty in taxing from the run-up area to the holding area of Runway XX. I contacted the ZZZ1 Tower and advised them I was holding short of Runway XX. The Tower cleared me to proceed to Runway XX and take off to right traffic.I taxied onto Runway XX and proceed to take off and climb. The airplane immediately began to yaw to the left despite my using the right rudder pedal to compensate for the left turning tendency caused by the P-factor; but the airplane continued to yaw to the left. I reached an altitude of approximately 1;400 ft. and began a 30-degree right turn. The airplane continued to become unstable. I noticed the ball in the turn coordinator was all the way to the right. I applied more right rudder to correct but the airplane but it to the left and then right. The rudder pedals weren't responsive to my input to control the yawing. I was experiencing difficulty in maneuvering the airplane and staying in a straight and level flight at which time I felt it was in my best interest to return to ZZZ1. I contacted the Tower and advised them that I was experiencing rudder control and needed to immediately return. Tower asked if I could do return and land on Runway XY. I advised Tower that I didn't believe I could affect a turn and land on Runway XY and would attempt to land on Runway XX. I entered the right pattern for a landing on Runway XX and continued to have difficulty maintaining a straight and level flight. I paralleled Runway XX (Downwind). I decreased the RPM from 2350 to 1700 when I was aligned with the north end of Runway XY. I then attempted a 30 degree right turn onto base when I was 45 degrees with the numbers for Runway XX and began my decent. I was having difficulty effecting the turn and turn for the final for Runway XX.I overshot and approached Runway XX at 45-degrees. My airspeed was 85 KTS. I was aware this to 10 KTS over the approach and recommending landing speed. I considered a go-around but didn't believe I would be able to safely do so. I reduced the power to idle as I entered the runway; brought the nose up to reduce airspeed; landed hard on the rear wheels; bounced up and came down on the front wheel and began to porpoise. I again; did not believe I could effectively increase power and safely do a go-around once I began to porpoise. I taxied back to the FBO and reported the incident to the office personal and the mechanics. I was unaware until informed by the owner and operator of the FBO that I had a propeller strike.I have approximately 85 hours of dual instruction flight time and 4 hours solo and never experienced this type of airplane instability with my instructors or since I began soloing. This was my second time flying this aircraft. I familiarized myself with this aircraft previously and on this date prior to departing the FBO. This was flight was to be my second cross-country flight. My prior flights with my instructors and since soloing have been without incident.
1917332,While on the ILS Runway XX at ZZZ1 I selected flaps 30 but the flaps did not extend past 25 degrees. We executed a missed approach and due to the wet runway and wind shear conditions we diverted to ZZZ2. We ran the FM procedures; notified Dispatch and briefed the flight attendants on the plan. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ2 Approach. We executed the ILS Runway XXR to ZZZ2 to an uneventful full stop. During the ILS Runway XXR the flaps operated and indicated normally and we landed with flaps 30. Maintenance inspected the aircraft and returned it to service. We continued to ZZZ1 within our duty day to a normal landing at ZZZ1.
1876957,Nose Gear collapsed; first felt like a flat tire on left side when landing.
1923811,"Departing GPI Runway 20 with Tower closed. We were filed KILLY 1 SID. Read the NOTAMs for the airport and the following NOTAM was published. 09 SEP 2021 17:07-01 JUN 2037 00:00* KILLY ONE DEPARTURE (RNAV)... TAKEOFF MINIMUMS: RWY 20 NA-ATC. ALL OTHER DATA REMAINS AS PUBLISHED.""We interpreted this to mean only the takeoff minimums were Not Authorized and all other data remains as published. We departed and flew the SID. Salt Lake Center advised us this SID was not authorized for Runway 20 and cleared us direct TOFUU Intersection. We asked ATC for clarification on the wording and they agreed the wording was confusing and are filling a report also to change the wording of the NOTAM. Continued and completed the flight safely and uneventfully."""
1906142,At cruise; the flight deck crew noticed mild light odor. Consulted cabin if they noticed any odors. They said not in cabin but after a thorough cabin investigation they said a mild odor was in aft galley. Ran QRH FUMES. Odor dissipated in flight deck and cabin. No further odors. QRH complete. Contacted Dispatch. Continued to ZZZ uneventfully. Entered into logbook. Contacted Maintenance.
1924933,This is more for informational reasons for other pilots. We departed ZZZ. I was the instructor with a Student in a PA28-161. We had flight following with ZZZ Approach. The door on the plane popped open during maneuvers. We ran the DOOR OPEN IN FLIGHT checklist; slowed to 89 KIAS; Vents closed; window open but the door would not close. It was very loud and windy in the cockpit and we could not hear ATC well. We went back to ZZZ and landed without incident. I was not able to hear ATC communications and was not sure if I missed any calls. The emergency checklist did not work during this incident but we landed safe and closed the door and then proceeded with the day.
1866852,Very short taxi to [Runway] 8L in Ontario so we had discussed and ran before takeoff checklist down to the line before leaving ramp. As we approached 8L I had called Tower and let them know we were ready for departure. If I remember they briefly told us to hold short awaiting IFR clearance and then it was just a couple seconds later she cleared us for takeoff on Runway 8L. The Captain was taxiing the aircraft into position as I was running the before takeoff checklist. As the airplane was just getting aligned with centerline the Captain mentioned he thought there was something on the runway. I was actually looking towards the far end of the runway to see if I could see any type of strobes or lighting as it was night time. It was once we had all the aircraft lights on that we could clearly see a van parked broadsided right on the middle of the runway about 1;000 feet in front of us or so. I had not yet called before takeoff checklist complete or verbally mentioned Runway 8L verified before the Captain had noticed something on the runway. No takeoff power was added or anything like that. I called the Tower to let them know there was a vehicle on the runway and the controller seemed very surprised. The controller cancelled our takeoff clearance and gave us a clearance to line up and wait. Controller then began communicating with FAA ground vehicles to try and get a hold of whomever was on the runway. Controller was unable to contact vehicle on the runway but was able to get a nearby airborne helicopter to hover over the vehicle and use a spotlight and or loud speaker to alert the personnel on the ground. We saw the ground personnel then run over to the vehicle; hop in; and drive off. The tower controller then had another FAA vehicle do a runway inspection the length of the runway and verify that everything was clear of the runway. Once the runway was verified to be clear we were once again cleared for takeoff. We ran the before takeoff checklist below the line again as it had been several minutes since our initial takeoff clearance. We departed ONT without further incident. The controller was very apologetic about the issue. Not sure exactly what happened or where the breakdown was that allowed the vehicle onto the runway without the controller's knowledge. It would have been very very difficult for controller to see the vehicle on the runway from the tower.Some type of breakdown in communication between FAA Ops vehicle/operator and Control Tower. The controller mentioned to us that the vehicle had not been authorized to be on the runway. I believe the operator had been out on the runway changing lights possibly? I do know the vehicle was running though and there was not anybody in the vehicle. Not exactly sure how/why vehicle had gotten out onto the active runway without authorization. Better communication/procedures between Ground Ops/Tower. I also think that if you're going to have vehicles like that on the runway; especially at night; they should be required to have some sort of strobe or beacon light. The vehicle was honestly very hard to see before all of our aircraft lights were on. If the vehicle had been further down the runway; I'm not sure we would have noticed it before we began the takeoff roll.
1902208,After turning off the left PACK; right PACK light comes on. We were cleared by ATC for FL280 at that moment stopped at FL200 and requested descent and an air turn back to ZZZ. We were cleared direct to ZZZ and decent to 10;000 ft. by ATC. We read the check list for right PACK light; while we were on the check list; Cabin Altitude Warning horn activated; CABIN ALT exceeded above 15;000 ft. and passenger oxygen masks deployed. We read check list for (Cabin Altitude or Rapid Decompression) we used oxygen masks until 11;000 ft. Didn't request priority handling because situation was under control. Had 45 minutes ground stop in ZZZ1. PACK was running for cooling purposes and cause PACK Overheat in flight. We decided to stop climbing at FL200; and run the check list for left BLEED TRIP light.
1867635,Cargo shipment containing UN3316 not registered on flight and no NOTOC issued - cargo loaded on Aircraft X.
1921992,Day started with one aircraft that had a maintenance item being worked on by Maintenance. The First Officer (FO) and myself began to set the aircraft up for the flight and then waited for the maintenance crew to complete their service of the aircraft when we were notified of a tail swap. Proceeded as normal on the second aircraft and boarded as per usual. We departed as usual and got a clearance to a fix and up to 13;000 ft. After passing 10;000 ft.; we noticed the cabin pressure was not normal and before we knew it Cabin ALT HI EICAS message was up. We followed procedure and donned our masks; I (pilot monitoring (PM)) had called for the QRC as the FO was a little behind calling for it. I told him that he's pilot flying (PF) to descend to 10;000 ft. A moment of stress and confusion to be certain. I followed the checklist and notified ATC a return to ZZZ with a need for some time to set up as assured the FO that he is PF and I will run the checklists as PM. We finished the checklists and noticed the pressurization knob was on LFE (Landing Field Elevation) select and not AUTO. Let's return to this moment a little bit later. We continued configuring the aircraft and noticed normal pressurization on the return to ZZZ; the FO asked if I wanted to fly the aircraft and decided that would be a good decision. We configured the aircraft and set up and briefed the approach and notified ATC we are ready to head towards ZZZ...which resulted in a go around due to tight vectors from ATC to get us in causing us to become unstable. We came back around and landed safely. The moment we noticed the Pressurization Selector knob not in AUTO still dumbfounds both pilots as we are certain that we saw it facing up (auto) earlier but when we questioned each other about it we determined we were not certain if it was that aircraft or the one prior even though flows were done on both aircraft. Possible pilot error. Have a Crew Awareness EICAS message noting the pressurization knob is not in the normal position.
1893342,I was planning the event flight and there was a placard I had not seen before; - Left Winglet Lower Blade Removed. Among a FL320 altitude restriction and other performance hits that are handled by Company; the placard requires that the airspeed be limited to 270 KIAS/0.73 Mach or below. I ensured that the flight's speed was restricted per the placard; completed the other normal planning; and released the flight. The Captain called later due to a conflict with the aforementioned placard and the flight's routing. They mentioned that the ZZZZZ2 RNAV STAR they were filed on has a note stating 'Turbojet and turboprop aircraft capable of 280 kt. or greater only.' When I was originally planning the flight I was more focused on ensuring the speed and other performance restrictions were calculated correctly and the thought of the routing having a minimum required speed (compared to a maximum speed limit) did not occur to me. Looking at the other arrivals into ZZZ; the only other procedure that did not have a similar requirement coming from the same direction was the ZZZZZ1 STAR. The Captain requested to be re-released and filed onto the ZZZZZ1; which seemed fine to me during our discussion.I contacted ATC to remove the flight's current filing and was working on re-releasing it until I noticed the note on the ZZZZZ1 stating 'DME/DME/IRU or GPS equipped turbojet aircraft landing ZZZ must file the ZZZZZ3/ZZZZZ4 or ZZZZZ/ZZZZZ5 RNAV STAR.' I contacted the ATC desk to get clarification on whether it would be more appropriate to file the ZZZZZ1 or ZZZZZ2 due to these conflicts and they suggested that they make a request with ATC command center to file the ZZZZZ2 while acknowledging the flight is restricted to 270 KIAS/0.73 Mach or below and FL320 or below due to the placard. The request was approved; and I discussed this plan with the Captain; who agreed. The flight operated without further incident.
1891341,Experienced engine roughness and partial power loss; followed by engine surging. A CFI rated passenger contacted ZZZ Approach and informed them of the situation. Issue turned out to be fuel exhaustion in left tip tank; situation was remediated by switching to left main tank. Approx. 40 gallons on board at the time. Left tip drained unusually quickly due to slow fuel leak discovered after landing. Pilot error; believed fuel tank in use was left main tank which was full. No further issues encountered. No damage to aircraft as result; power was never lost completely.
1924245,We were dispatched under MEL XX-XX-XXX due to the info message: 79 L ENGINE FAULT-OIL DEBRIS ABOVE LIMIT. Departure and the first 3 hours of flight were normal as far as the engine operation. At FL370 at XA26Z we received the: L ENG OPER DEGRADED message. I assigned the First Officer to continue flying and started the related Checklist. At XA27 we got: FMS PERF ACTIVE L ENG FAIL. I halted the previous Checklist after just a few steps; [requested priority handing] and told ATC we needed lower. Clearance was received. We accomplished the L ENG FAIL checklist followed by the L ENG Shutdown and FMS PERF Active checklist. Attempted APU start- no indications. Knowing there had been metal in the oil and that the auto relight failed we elected to not try a relight. We both agreed that ZZZ looked good given our location and the Thunderstorms near most major airports ahead. Arranged clearance to ZZZ with ATC and a right turn to avoid weather to our left. Notified infight (who had tried to call while we were running the shutdown procedure) code X. Notified the passengers. Notified Dispatch. While Captain was notifying above the First Officer accomplished reprogramming the destination for ZZZ while flying and communicating. Accomplished Non Normal Landing Data Calc checklist (no wifi and no ACARS aerodata; done manually). Both pilots set up for visual with ILS backup for XXR in ZZZ. Captain reviewed for First Officer all checklists accomplished and limitations/considerations. First Officer briefed approach. All above and Approach checklist accomplished by mid teens ALT. Normal approach and landing; CFR standing by; taxied to Gate with no assistance. Did Logbook writeup.
1923584,I am a CFI that was conducting the long IFR cross country with my instrument student. We made a flight plan leaving KPVU to ZZZ our home airport. We briefed our route prior to flight. We contacted salt lake approach for a clearance and cleared us to ZZZ with the instrument departure procedure (PROVO4) we briefed the departure and knew it was going to be close. We departed KPVU and started the DP. I noticed fairly soon that we were not making the required climb gradient for the departure. I then told ATC about not being able to meet the required climb gradient and was told I needed to maintain the climb gradient. I replied back to the best of my knowledge saying currently flying our best rate of climb. Which was fluctuating from 150-700 fpm. I then started to think of a plan because we were approaching rising terrain. ATC warned me of the terrain and I then asked for a 30 degree left turn for terrain. ATC replied I was below the min vectoring altitude and gave me a low altitude alert. I then replied to cancel IFR and I turned the aircraft back towards KPVU and told ATC that I was going to climb either over the airport or near it 'I forget my exact words' to 10;300 for the MEA required for the route and get a new clearance upon reaching 10300. I was then told by ATC that I needed to copy a phone number for a possible pilot deviation. Reflecting on this issue I now realized that I had a few other options I could have used. Departing VFR and picking up a clearance in the air because of the VFR conditions present. As well as taking into consideration that our calculated climb rate at the time was just enough to make the DP mins with not much of a buffer. Which later proved to not be satisfactory for the DP. I should have also canceled IFR right away once I noticed we were not making the climb gradient required.
1890108,Approaching top of climb while in route from ZZZ to ZZZ1; we received multiple gear disagree messages associated with the nose wheel indicating unlocked. We transferred flight controls and proceeded with the QRH. We made the decision to return to ZZZ based on suitable Runway length and support for passengers and maintenance. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ. ATC gave us vectors to fly on a downwind for the ZZZ Tower inspect the landing gear. Landing was successful.
1903474,I was assigned to load Aircraft X on Gate XX but prior to loading the trip on Gate XX; I was given another task which was to offload Aircraft Y on Gate XY. and before going to Gate XX I needed to wait for my local driver to return from running his bags from the inbound on Gate XY. once he returned; we headed to Gate XX where there was another crew assisting us on the outbound. it was a heavy outbound going to ZZZ. But the assist crew left after we arrived. I was only given thirty-five minutes to load the trip with minimal ground time. And since the outbound Aircraft X was a very heavy trip; my frame of mind was every preoccupy with all aspects of the flight and receiving other tasks while I was still doing Aircraft X. I was not given sufficient time to evaluate what Cargo; and other commodities was to be loaded. I pulled up the Dangerous Goods Form paperwork but with all the confusion; I forgot to give the Dangerous Goods Form paperwork to the Captain. After realizing I still had the Dangerous Goods Form paperwork in my pocket; I notify the Tower to bring back the Aircraft to the Gate and give the Captain his paperwork. I notify the Tower and inform them of the situation of the Dangerous Goods Form paperwork on Aircraft X which I accidentally forgot to give the Captain being the fact that I am constantly rushed in doing my assigned tasks. My suggestion would be do not move crews from Gate to Gate and that would limit the number of mistakes.
1899133,SEEVR 4 arrival trailing a A320 encountered wake turbulence at 10000 ft. at waypoint NUSSS. Aircraft rolled 15 degrees right and autopilot disconnected. Corrected turn and turned autopilot off. No loss of altitude or airspeed. Contacted ATC and notified them about the situation. Landed with no further incidents. No injuries and Maintenance found no faults. More than likely aircraft were too close in trail. Ensure adequate space between aircraft on arrival.
1910439,Short Final Runway 16 - Observed small UAS operating approx. 150 ft. off centerline; approx. 200 ft. AGL. No evasive action taken; unsafe at low altitude. Vehicles observed in city park adjacent to approach end of Runway 16; No persons observed in operation of UAS.
1917283,We leveled off at 28;000 feet. I was listening to the MYR ATIS at the time; but was aware of ATC making altitude inquiries to an opposite direction Aircraft X. ATC was attempting to verify that Aircraft X was level at 27000 and that his altimeter was set to 29.92. The aircraft verified that he was at 27;000 and his altimeter was 29.92. However; he kept climbing. This began at a distance of 10 miles. Aircraft X continued to climb and we received an RA caution message. At this time; I paid sole attention to the TCAS alert and ATC. Suddenly; we received a TCAS warning with instructions to climb. The TCAS climb rate required as 2;200 feet per minute at 28;000 feet. We immediately complied with TCAS and I saw that we went over the top of Aircraft X just 300 feet below. Had we not immediately complied with the TCAS; it is likely that a mid air collision would have occurred. After the event was over; we asked ATC for information about the aircraft we just went over. They gave us a Center number to call; and we called it when safely on the ground. From the call; we learned the aircraft type; tail number; and that we had a closure rate of over 900 knots. We never saw Aircraft X as we were in IMC through the entire event.
1885887,At Gate XX on Aircraft X after starting the APU and then turning on the APU Bleed a strong odor of smelly socks was noted in the cockpit. The APU Bleed was subsequently turned off and the odor subsided. Item was written up in the AML and ZZZ Maintenance was notified. This was a previous write [up] the day before on this aircraft. Contamination of aircraft bleed system.
1924053,I had canceled IFR flight plan to ZZZ to fly the VFR Flyway off the coast. We maintained squawk code and traffic advisories from Center. While at 1700 ft. we received numerous notifications from ATC regarding potential traffic conflicts. This traffic was initially reported at our 11:00 to 12:00 o'clock and 1 to 2 miles; best recollection. We finally spotted traffic just off our left nose about 20 feet above and approximately 1/8 mile. We reported that we had traffic in sight and watched as the traffic passed. I received a call from the FSDO inquiring about a near mid-air collision report from ATC. I recalled the above to the best of my memory of the event. As we were talking with ATC and receiving multiple traffic advisories; I really didn't think anymore about the situation until receiving the call from FSDO office. We were VFR passing another VFR target in an area with moderate to heavy traffic all below the Class B airspace.
1894573,Heading to ZZZ1 Airport; with a stop at ZZZ2 airport; noticed low oil pressure and high oil temperatures. Diverted to ZZZ airport and with the added stress of the situation incorrectly identified airport frequency. Proceeded with arrival after attempting to make contact due to oil situation; avoiding flow of traffic and occupied ramp and taxiway areas. Called Tower and discussed; no other issues. In future - more thorough checks of sectional maps would correct this issue. In addition; if the situation permits it; a circling orbit or two would provide extra time to verify all airport information.
1892714,Bird strike caused fail wing slat on descent. So we had to go around so pilots could resolve a solution etc.. All went well and we landed safely. No emergency evacuation.
1932009,During landing; gusting wind caused aircraft to drift off Runway during early phase of landing; so initiated a go-around. During go around; aircraft left wheel pant contacted Runway edge light; damaging light and wheel pant. Pilot's low recent hours in aircraft and landing in gusty winds were main cause of accident. More recent experience with landings; especially in windy conditions would have led to greater proficiency in such and likely would have prevented the [incident]. Continuing to a different airport with more favorable winds also would have been an option that could have prevented the [incident].
1935711,After departing ZZZ while climbing through FL220 the R Eng Pylon Overheat CAS message illuminated. I called for the QRH and asked to level at 240 which Center immediately cleared me to do. As part of the checklist we reduced the affected engine to idle and the CAS went out. We elected to return to ZZZ. During descent the CAS message come on so per the QRH we shut down the right engine and informed ATC. We completed the shutdown and single engine checklists and landed. We stopped on a high speed turnoff; shutdown and evacuated the passenger. We along with the emergency crew inspected the aircraft and found no evidence of fire or heat damage. The passengers were given a ride to the FBO by the emergency crew while we taxied the aircraft to the FBO on the other engine. Not much to say other than we did what we were trained to do and it worked out well.
1923633,After landing at ZZZ following a flight from ZZZ1; I departed behind a small Cessna; I believe a C-150 or C-152. I climbed out at 90 mph indicated as the instructors have trained us which is Vx. I do not recall hearing radio calls from the Cessna. My aircraft has a very long nose making forward visibility very limited at a 10 degree or higher deck angle to achieve 90 mph indicated airspeed. With that configuration; I could not see the Cessna in front of me. As I turned right cross-wind; the Cessna suddenly appeared above me and to my left. I flew beneath the Cessna and crossed under his flight path and departed the traffic pattern to the South. The Instructor in the Cessna asked if I had the Cessna in sight. I said that I did. He said they had been making radio calls. I said I did not recall hearing them. Analysis: We are trained to climb at Vx. With the long nose of the modified SNJ-4; I lost sight of the Cessna. In the future; I will need to periodically lower the nose to view traffic in front of me during climbout.
1921821,Descending on the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ through approximately 9000 ft.; in VMC we encountered moderate turbulence for approximately 2-4 seconds. The aircraft banked to the right and we received a roll authority alert. As quickly as we started to manage the turbulence; the encounter had already ended. Prior to the turbulence event; we were in smooth air from the cruise phase of flight all the way through our descent. I asked the First Officer to call the flight attendants to make sure they were OK. Flight Attendant (FA) XX Stated he fell into a passenger seat and hit his arm on an overhead bin but said he was OK. The rest of the flight went smoothly without incident and after all the passengers deplaned; I debriefed the flight attendants and checked on their well being. During our debrief FA XX stated his arm was sore but thought he was alright. FA XY said she was thrown into her jump seat and that the turbulence was severe. The two remaining Flight Attendants were in the front of the aircraft and did not report being jostled or injured.
1929897,During post flight an area was discovered on right wing that appeared to have indicated we hit something airborne. The area does not look like we hit something organic; there is evidence of a heat signature and the fairing has exposed composite. We never saw anything however I am wondering if we grazed a drone. The aircraft static wicks are all intact and we never encountered any weather. I do not believe this to be a lightning strike.
1878062,In traffic pattern on downwind; a Pawnee entered pattern above us without visual contact.
1917127,Departed ZZZ; Aircraft X; to ZZZ1 on Date. Approximately 100 E/NE ZZZ2 while at FL340 at XA50Z; while deviating north for weather; the flight crew received a Master Caution and ECAM for HYD SYS LO PRSR for the Yellow Hydraulic System. Subsequently; a FLT CNTRL ECAM was received due a partial spoiler deployment (#4) on the right wing. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying and the Captain was the Pilot Monitoring. All QRC; ECAM; QRH and follow-up procedures were completed by the Pilot Monitoring. While the Pilot Flying continued the weather deviation; the Pilot Monitoring conferred with dispatch on flight options and diversion details; to include the NOTAMs for ZZZ2. A request for priority handling was made and a diversion to ZZZ2 with ATC priority radar vectors for descent. Coordination via a precautionary landing brief to the flight attendants and passenger PA were also completed. Additional information regarding the partial spoiler deployment was obtained via communication between the Pilot Monitoring and the number one Flight Attendant via a visual inspection of the right wing. There was a noticeable right wing dip at altitude and increased buffet and droop during the descent and approach phase of flight. The Pilot Flying executed a visual approach; with the electronic means of backup using the ILS XXR to an underweight landing (132;000 pounds). After clearing the Runway; an Airport Rescue and Firefighting vision inspection was executed; with the crew confirming flight crew suspicions of hydraulic fluid loss along the belly of the aircraft. With the Green; Blue hydraulic systems intact; the aircraft was taxied to Gate XX. Cause was determined to be the mechanical failure of Yellow System Reservoir. ECAM status page mentions approach phase procedures which result in return of HYD SYS LO PRSR ECAM warning (engine pump on) which can confuse with electric pump on since both work with Yellow System.
1918081,On final approach to XXL in ZZZZ; out of 5;000 ft. and cleared for the approach; the first officer armed the approach mode. Once armed; we received multiple EICAS messages (3 pages) of system failures. I lost background lighting and multiple instruments. I looked up at the electrical panel and noted the STBY PWR OFF Light illuminated. After requesting priority handling; I handed the Paper QRH to the International Relief Officer and instructed her to read the Standby Power Off checklist. We complied with the checklist and continued the approach to an uneventful landing.On rollout; I took control of the aircraft; and through 100 kts.; felt the airplane being sluggish. I stated I thought we had blown tires; as our inboard tires had no anti-skid protection. We cleared the runway; and noted the break temp monitors were at 9 on my outboard brakes. I called Tower to ensure services were enroute; and wanted them to focus on our main landing gear in case of fire. Once ensured there was no fire; I contacted Ops; Dispatch; Maintenance Control to make everyone aware of our situation. After approximately 30 minutes I was informed that all 8 main tires were flat. Air stairs were brought to the aircraft; and all passengers and crew egressed with no injuries. We were taken by bus to the main terminal.Before leaving the aircraft; an ELB write up was accomplished. Upon further investigation of the logbook's history; I see there was a similar write up of a 'hard power transfer' when the approach mode was selected with multiple EICAS messages. In their case; they never lost STBY PWR; as in mine. Seems there was an electric anomaly with this jet that was never found by Maintenance. In my opinion; the paper QRH should not be removed from our aircraft; as it was the fastest means for us to accomplish a lengthy checklist before landing; as this problem presented itself at a very inopportune moment on approach.This is an addendum to a previous report. It was brought to my attention after landing that the speed brakes failed to deploy; and the crew missed that fact with all our attention focused on failed systems; checklists; and flying the airplane. Upon landing my focus was squarely on keeping the airplane tracking the runway center line. In the end; with the length of runway; I do not believe the speed brakes were a factor in the final outcome of the flight.
1893509,Fuel starvation caused by a multitude of events. Left tank seemed to have a leak during preflight- made sure the sump was tightened to prevent any further issue. Likely took off on the left tank (~17 gallons) while right tank was full (25 gallons). Student was near checkride ready; so it was more of an observation flight as a CFI. Student was not paying attention when the GPS message popped up every 30 minutes to change tanks. We did burn off the right tank for 30 minutes; but the rest had to have been on the left tank. I noticed the message as we were around 5 miles out from the ZZZ and decided to let him finish his approach in and point it out after landing and getting ready for a few trips in the traffic pattern. We ended up going around once because he didn't like his approach. The second trip around we had an extended pattern and good separation between the aircraft we were following. They ended up taking a further exit off the Runway which forced another go around. I thought the engine coughed because the Student slammed full power in after missing the go around call from Tower; so I took the radio call and told him he was told to go around. We get up maybe around 700 AGL when the engine starts coughing more and my only immediate response was fuel pump on until I realized we just need to land safely. The go around was from 27R; we requested priority handling and landed on 09R. We got down safely and the engine was fully dead when we attempted to turn off the Runway. The fuel pump made loud and unusual noises; so I decided not to attempt a further restart. I think the shock of what just happened set in so I decided to get a tug back to the Ramp. For future lessons; I will ensure students verbally say which tank they change to and verify the fullest tank. I will also be watching even more closely for the GPS messages to change tanks - I had seen them; but the student had not. It will be drilled into their heads.
1905592,The Hot Spot at Syracuse at the intersection of Taxiway M and [Taxiway] A has documented no less than 8 runway incursions since December 2017. Airline aircraft; not general aviation aircraft; account for 7 of these incursions with 1 vehicle deviation for this location. Seven of the eight incursions; 88%; occurred in VMC conditions. Syracuse does not have an ASDE-X; and has taxiway lights; runway edge lighting and wig-wag lights indicating the entrance to a runway only when lights are turned on during IMC conditions.These runway incursions are discussed at annual meetings held at the Syracuse Airport. At the very least new signage and in-pavement lighting need to be installed. Although ASDE is no longer an option; a ground based radar with lighting controls would be the best solution.
1907945,I was practicing patterns and landings on runway XX at the ZZZ airport; and on my final landing; I taxied to the end of the runway to taxi back to the ramp. There was another plane just behind me and I ended up needlessly hurrying to the taxiway; and I didn't manage to get the plane stopped in time. As I turned off the runway; I knew it would be a tight turn; but I stopped once I felt the nose slightly drop as the nosewheel rolled onto the grass. From this point; I knew I was in a bind; so I made a radio call asking for assistance and shut down the engine. From there; a line worker was able to come to help push my plane back onto the taxiway. In the future; the corrective action is to be more patient and taxi in a slower; more controlled manner. As best as I can tell; no damage was sustained to any part of the plane or area of excursion.
1910439,Short Final Runway 16 - Observed small UAS operating approx. 150 ft. off centerline; approx. 200 ft. AGL. No evasive action taken; unsafe at low altitude. Vehicles observed in city park adjacent to approach end of Runway 16; No persons observed in operation of UAS.
1882256,Winds at 9;000 ft. were out of the southwest at 125 kts. CVG weather was marginal with gusty winds out of the West. The NOTAMs for ILS27 included alternate missed approach instructions which we used to edit the FMC. We were to climb to 2;000 ft. and turn left to FLM for holding at 3;000 ft. We briefed and talked about this difference which would most likely set us up for vectors from the south of the field. We were vectored for ILS27; holding 170 kts. until the marker. Configuration was F20 gear up. I held off on gear extension until glide slope capture which put our landing flap selection close to '1;000 ft. stable' threshold. I remember thinking that we had about 600 ft. for the flaps to move into position and complete the landing checklist. The remaining items of the event seemed compressed in time. Flaps were selected 25; speed brakes armed and landing checklist complete; and speed bug set for a wind correction of 161 kts. Just prior to 1;000 ft. an amber line strike out the GS pitch FMA. Shortly after the pitch bar on the FD biased out of view and EICAS message AUTOPILOT appeared. The raw data glideslope was missing.I do not believe that the Land 3 FMA annunciation changed; or at the least we didn't get a No AUTOLAND annunciation. My initial thought was that we were in an attitude stabilizing mode as there was a Aircraft Y in position on the runway. We then got a GPWS 'glideslope' aural alert in IMC flight conditions. I called and executed an immediate Go Around. Initial Tower instructions had us fly 290 heading and climb 3;000 ft. We were then given right turn to 360 when able and climb 4;000 ft. Starting the missed approach at 1;000 ft. AGL; 2;000 ft. MSL put us close to level off at 3;000 ft. and I recognized and compensated for this by holding the power levers from going full forward. Still the high rate at which the event took place coupled with hand flying; trying to get back to a place that we could re-automate; and accomplishing the go-around procedure while communicating with ATC made for a busy flight deck environment. We were able to engage the autopilot with the aircraft trimmed for the current flight path with about 1;000 ft. before leveling at 4;000 ft. I noticed that we were approaching 4;000 ft. with too much momentum and again manually decreased the thrust lever position. It didn't seem like the autopilot was going to even attempt a level off; much different than not exceeding a 1G level off; it was not pushing over much at all. I disconnected the autopilot and decreased the thrust levers to near idle as I attempted a manual level off but we were already climbing through our assigned altitude. The PM (Pilot Monitoring) called Tower telling them that we were not able 4;000 ft. and that we were already through the altitude. Tower immediately cleared us to 5;000 ft. which was uneventful.I believe that we were probable at around 4;300 ft. before the planes flight path was beginning to descend. We cleaned the aircraft to flaps 10 and 190 kts. due to the strong winds. We discussed the possibility of 5G interference with the glide slope as it wasn't a temporary fluctuation as you would expect with an aircraft in the critical area. I briefed and we discussed what the procedure would be if we encountered the same issues with the glide slope and how we could reconfigure for an IAN (Integrated Approach Navigation) approach. The second approach was uneventful with all systems working normally. ATC reported that the preceding aircraft reported no anomalies with the glideslope.Maintenance log reported Autopilot Caution and FD Bar Bias with ILS BEAM ERROR (FCC) 'NO ACTION REQUIRED'. I needed to focus more on the aircraft during the missed approach so as to anticipate the failed level off by the automation. The missed approach was a very busy time which was compounded by ATC changing headings and altitudes verses what was expected.
1934879,Captain (CA) was Pilot Flying (PF). We flew ZZZ1 XX with no issue and landed. Taxied off XX onto Runway YY. Ground told us to take Kilo and hold short abeam gate 33. After I read this back I began my after landing flow. I noticed the L BTMS [Brake Temperature Monitor system] Indicator on the most left wheel began to skyrocket. It went from 2 to 15 to 20 and then red. It gave us Master Warning Brake Overheat. ATC cleared us to taxi to the gate; but we told them we need to stay put and run a checklist. I ran Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) then Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). The Captain directed me to call ATC and ask for the fire trucks to take a look at the brakes; as we had no other abnormal indications (the BTMS directly next to it was reading only 02 and green). An airline taxiing by told us they did not see any smoke or fire; and the fire trucks relayed the same information when they arrived. They also took the temperature of the brakes. We elected to continue to the gate. Maintenance deferred the indicator.
1876484,I was flying Aircraft X Cessna C-172N from ZZZ to ZZZ1. This was a personal flight to help maintain pilot proficiency. This is a rental aircraft from a flight school located at ZZZ. I did a full checklist-based pre-flight inspection; and normal takeoff from ZZZ. Flying my planned ZZZ1 RNAV XX approach; I proceeded to ZZZZZ; via ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ2 altitudes; and performed pre-landing checks. Had 4 white lights on the Runway XX PAPI; reduced power to lose altitude and speed. PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; I adjusted power and attitude to maintain glide slope. Checked airspeed was in the white; added first notch of flaps. Waited for aircraft to stabilize; verified PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; checked airspeed; adjusted power; added second notch of flaps. Almost immediately after second notch of flaps there was a loud bang; an immediate turn to the right; losing altitude very quickly. I corrected the uncommanded turn as much as possible; adjusted power to maintain altitude; looked for cause of problem. I noted one flap up; one down; and went around. Gained altitude; circled; and carefully explored controllability of the aircraft; 'no change' to the flaps was best for aircraft controllability. I landed without incident. In addition to the control system failure; the aircraft apparently suffered damage to the flaps. The flight school Mechanic; and the flight school; are not communicating with me; so I do not know the extent of the damage. A careful look at GPS data shows the aircraft was operated within limits; including Vfe; at all times prior to the incident. While this flight ended with a safe landing; for me this was a very close call; and caused me a few sleepless nights processing the event. I was mentally processing the event through the evening of Date1; and did not report the control system failure as quickly as I should have. It took me a while to overcome the seriousness of the event before I started my reporting responsibilities.Not having any communication or support from the flight school added additional delay. I was hoping for more information and cooperation from the school in the reporting process; as well as resolving what happened and how to avoid this situation in the future. I regret my delay and have reviewed my reporting duties and responsibilities as pilot in command to help ensure prompt reporting as required by regulations.
1888396,I was working R24 for about an hour and a half today. All sectors around my sector were busy dealing with weather deviations and traffic routed from East coast to West coast. I did not have a D-side. During the session I had an aircraft respond to an RA descending above another aircraft. I think I violated W174. I estimate I probably had 3-4 airspace violations with Approach and surrounding sectors. This is/these are the incidents I noticed and/or remember. I did not have time to note aircraft call signs. A D-side would have helped with much of the coordination/airspace violations; but there simply was not sufficient staffing for a D-side. [I suggest] better staffing [and] better flow control.
1924123,While flying the final portion of the ZZZZZ STAR into ZZZ; we received a vector (fly current heading) prior to the final course intercept. When ATC told us to intercept final course; we were just about to fly through it. Reminded ATC that we were on a heading and not following the ZZZZZ course. They immediately gave us an intercept heading as we had just flown through final. Intercepted final. ATC gave clearance for visual approach. Aircraft was high and fast at glideslope intercept (not ATC's fault). In process of trying to slow down and capture glideslope from above; aircraft descended through glideslope and got approximately 1 dot low (autopilot had been selected off trying to capture glideslope from above). Crew recognized that we had gone low and as we were correcting; tower gave an altitude warning. Aircraft returned to glideslope and was stable at 500 ft. and landed uneventfully.
1935294,Today; on flight ABCA Aircraft X; a lavatory truck drove behind the aircraft in the middle of a push resulting in a near miss. As the pushback driver I had to adjust my push and slow down to avoid hitting him.
1916638,The event occurred while taxiing on the ZZZ ramp around D concourse. We were cleared by the east ramp frequency to taxi from our present position (pushed back off or EX) to spot 24X and contact the south ramp frequency. Immediately after receiving our clearance; an Aircraft X was cleared to make a right turn to spot 25X and contact Ground. Approximately a minute later; while rounding the corner from the north to south west; near spot 26 we had noted that there was an Aircraft Y that was stationary off to our right; further down the D concourse near gates D3 or D5. Shortly after passing spot 26 the Aircraft X turned out and proceeded immediately in front of us with no apparent regard for our direction of movement. Our Captain had to aggressively brake to ensure we would avoid the aircraft. Throughout this whole time; there was no communication from either the Aircraft Y; or the Ramp Controllers on involving any potential traffic conflicts on the ramp or having either us; or the Aircraft Y stop to avoid the conflict.
1906671,When the landing gear was extended for landing at ZZZ; the left brake indicated 600 lbs and the right brake indicated 250 lbs. Pressing the brake pedals had no effect. Went around and held while consulting with Dispatcher; Maintenance Control & Tech Pilot. Cycling the brake/antiskid switch had no effect. Consensus was a normal landing would be OK. [Requested priority handling] and landed normally. Pressure in blocks still shows 600 left; 250 right.
1888537,Climbing through roughly 17;000 ft. the Captain and I noticed a smell similar to a hot oven. It was not strong and we did not feel any adverse effects. The Captain called to the back and they confirmed nothing was in the oven and that they smelled it as well. As we leveled at 22;000 the smell dissipated and we assumed it was transitory. Upon final descent (7;000 on the downwind) into ZZZ we faintly smelled it again for a very brief period but it went away just as quickly. Once we parked we conferred with the flight attendants who informed us that the smell was worse in the back. Upon landing; we were evaluated by paramedics. I had a headache; dry metallic mouth; and all my vitals were normal. The smell itself did not cause alarm. It was not overwhelming; with no reduction in visibility; and no adverse effects inflight.
1920483,RPLC Ramp [erroneously] loaded ADG (Air Carrier Dangerous Goods container) in position 7R inso '[instead of] on a Hazmat pallet where it was accessible. RPLC Ramp loaded flammable liquid in a regular container and loaded in the back of the aircraft and departed. Once airborne the mistake was caught and they contacted me and I advised the crew via ACARS; the Supervisor and ZZZ Operations Control and Maintenance. Not sure if there was a language barrier since it was from RPLC to ZZZZ and it appeared some of the labels may have been in English?
1883078,We departed ZZZ and; upon rotation; immediately required an abnormal aileron control correction to maintain wings level. We knew instantly that something was not correct with the aircraft. We [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ for landing which occurred without incident. Upon consultation with Company at the FBO at ZZZ; we found that the fuel was out of balance. The fuel was balanced with the onboard fuel transfer system; and it was determined that there was no mechanical fault with the plane.Before take-off; and during our routine check of EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System); no flags or warnings as to any fuel imbalance were observed. In order to prevent a reoccurrence; we have incorporated an additional checklist item so as to verify fuel is balanced. Additionally; this situation will be discussed with all pilots that fly this aircraft.
1915848,We were operating to Detroit. The flight was operated normally and uneventfully until our downwind to base turn in the approach phase. During the downwind; we were advised that we were following a heavy A350 on a visual approach to 3R. We were assigned by Detroit Approach to descend to 4;000 ft.; maintain a speed of 190 kts. and fly a heading to turn base. During our descent and turn; we encountered an excessive rate (25-30 degrees) of roll to the left (back towards the downwind) and pitch (approximately +10 degrees) from the wake of the A350.The First Officer (Pilot Flying) and I (Pilot Monitoring) simultaneously disconnected the autopilot. The First Officer properly responded by arresting the rate of roll; pitch and decrease in speed in accordance with the CFM. We had gained approximately 600 ft. from the wake turbulence and stabilized the aircraft on a downwind heading at 5;000 ft. and speed of 190 kts. I advised ATC of the wake turbulence upset and what we were doing to stabilize the aircraft. They acknowledged us and once we were stable; I queried ATC about being cleared to resume our descent to 4;000 ft. ATC re-cleared us to 4;000 ft.; and we proceeded inbound and landed without further issue.The wake turbulence of the A350 had created an excessive roll rate (25-30 degrees) back towards the downwind and a positive pitch (approximately 10 degrees) and a negative speed trend. As we turned our base; we encountered the roll back towards the opposite direction and then recovered on the downwind leg and had a slight climb from the positive pitch.
1917899,Aircraft received landing gear airground fail message on short final. Performed go around; ran QRH; came back to ZZZMaintain vigilance for changing conditions.
1911515,On climb from ZZZ noticed oil temp rising faster on right engine; as aircraft approached cruise altitude of FL370 we were hoping the oil temp would decrease but even after power back for cruise the oil temp kept rising slowly. Ran checklist and reduced power slightly; temp still rising; powered back to 50%; still rising; airspeed decreasing now asked for lower and decided to go back to ZZZ. Temp did not decrease until much lower altitude; Seemed normal under 10;000 feet. Returned to ZZZ and landed uneventfully. Never did oil temp reach red line but was very close for quite a while.
1903099,Our trip was originally scheduled as a commercial flight to ZZZZ with a 24 hour layover then operate back to ZZZ. We were rescheduled to DH (Dead Head) on Aircraft Y and immediately operate back as Aircraft X with no layover. This was my first trip back after vacation and my FO (First Officer) flew week prior. The arrival into ZZZZ had thunderstorms with low ceiling. Inbound crew broke out on arrival at 500 ft. with marginal VFR conditions at field. We took over aircraft as inbound crew went to hotel. We both did preflight duties and took our time. The CREW SAFETY briefing was very thorough. We discussed threats in detail. Fatigue; night ops in ZZZZ versus daytime; weather; terrain; communication; complex engine out procedures and my lack of recent flying. Then reviewed ZZZZ [information]. The performance verification was not rushed and all checklist completed 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Engine start; push back; taxi out were all normal. I was Pilot Flying and we were cleared for departure on Runway XX (Winds were 090/3; temp 14C; altimeter 1029 hPa; dry runway. Aircraft TOGW 345;700; thrust D TO 29; V1 154; VR 156; V2 160; N1 107.1). Thrust was set initially to 70% N1. Engines spooled up normally. Thrust mode was selected and engine accelerated normally. 80 knots was called out by PM (Pilot Monitoring) and verified and checked. I noticed I was drifting slightly right of centerline. I added left rudder to correct. The acceleration did not seem normal at this time (approximately passing 100 knots). This perception was based on past heavy weight; high altitude takeoffs. I glanced at EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) and engine instrument gauges and noticed N1 for right engine was rolling back and left was still at 107. I made decision to reject at approximately 118 knots. RTO (Rejected Takeoff) engaged as advertised and rapidly stopped the aircraft. We cleared runway and let tower know our intention to return to parking. During taxi back we discussed brake temperatures; FO asked ATC to have ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) called. FO called Dispatch which confirmed Block Turn Back. When in parking; asked mechanic to only chock nose wheel and stay away from main gear. No parking brake. Accomplished shutdown and secure checklist. Mechanic confirmed brakes were heated which agreed with our brake temp light on and BTMS (Brake Temperature Monitoring System) numbers increasing to 8s and 9s. We reviewed rejected takeoff procedure in AOM especially notes. We then (per AOM) reviewed Chapter 5 cooling chart for 767. Coordination between cockpit; mechanic and ARFF was good (Four tire fuse plugs melted and tires deflated). ARFF departed after no signs of further hazard.
1901508,At about five minutes prior to push back we received the performance data; and at the same time received a Dispatch message stating 'HAZMAT on flight.'  I made the notation on my Release in the remarks section; but failed to put the notation on the Ops copy.
1906711,While acting as Pilot Flying Aircraft X ZZZ to ZZZ1; during our takeoff roll and shortly before rotation speed a 'Tire failure' alert was triggered. As we continued our takeoff; once airborne the Pilot Monitoring inadvertently retracted the landing gear; however extended it again to remain compliant with company procedures. As we continued our climb; the Captain decided to assume aircraft controls and asked me to run the QRH procedures for TIRE FAIL. At the same time; we notified ATC about our situation; intentions to return to the airport and requested fuel dumping. Upon reaching ATC assigned altitude and vectors; we were authorized to start the fuel dump; which we performed as per the QRH's FUEL DUMP checklist. Before we landed on Runway XXR; we decided to [request priority handling] as a precaution and the landing was performed uneventfully. Upon exiting the runway; fire truck personnel indicated over the radio that all landing gear tires looked well; with the exception of a nose-wheel tire that seemed low. We then taxied to the gate uneventfully.[Identified] after V1; shortly before rotation speed. Although the tire pressure indications for one of the nose gear was deferred; the TIRE FAIL alert was not deactivated. Follow company procedures and ensure proper maintenance procedures for deferrals are performed.
1924482,After Takeoff from ZZZ we were unable to retract the landing gear. The First Officer was flying and after checking for an ECAM exception or quick action item I assigned flying duties and ATC communications to the First Officer. I completed the ECAM actions which failed to remedy the situation so I advised the First Officer to head to ZZZ1. I made a quick PA since it was very noisy just to put everyone at ease while I pulled out my QRH then completed the appropriate follow up items. I then notified the #1 Flight Attendant with the test items then made another PA explaining the situation. I then used the crew phone to call Dispatch and they were aware we were headed to ZZZ1. Since we were going to land at 182;000 pounds I reviewed the overweight landing checklist and discussed the options with the First Officer. The weather was clear with calm winds and a long Runway so decided it was best to land rather than burn off gas for an hour or more. I also called Dispatch to tell them my intention to make an overweight landing. The First Officer made the landing and everything was normal so we taxied to the Gate.
1891270,During landing RALT 2 fail EICAS (engine indicating and crew alerting system) message popped up. Possible 5G interference. Wrote up in Maintenance can. We were landing Stadium Visual 29.
1889150,IMC; Pilot in Command; Pilot Flying [on] arrival; getting vectors for Runway XX; weather 800/3 WIND 320/16G26; Altimeter 999 MB. 5000 ft.; flaps 5; 200 KTS. ATC says ' cleared direct ZZZZZ; descend 3000 ft. cleared RNAV XX approach. Transition Level is 4500 ft. being close in to ZZZZZ on autopilot; Pilot Flying wanted FLCH to 3000 quickly so as to engage LVSAFE process ASAP. When prompted Altimeters; at Transition Level of 4500; by the time all altimeters set going from STD to 999 MB instantly lost approximately 800 ft.; do to transiting to LOW pressure aircraft was slightly below 3000 Autopilot didn't capture altitude selected above it. Auto throttles did not wake up slowed to 180 KTS; until recovery had to be initiated manually at 2740 with power and autopilot disconnected. Autopilot was re-selected at 3000 ft. and the approach was accomplished uneventfully. A safety representative called me and was asked to file company report.The Transition Level was known to the crew and we were prepared for the transition. What was not prepared for the instant loss of 1000 due to the very low altimeter setting; in a good descent rate put the aircraft below the selected altitude. The autopilot did not capture; an attempt on the MCP was made to change pitch mode and reacquire the selected altitude of 3000; and no autopilot response was met with a manual pilot intervention at 2740. All taken place after 10 hour all-nighter; IMC; and both pilots less than 100 hours in type; however familiar with ZZZZ in other Aircraft and seats. I recommend a published company procedure for this eventuality and crew awareness brief; so as to not be surprised by it. Lesser experienced crews might have gotten into real trouble. An easy to read conversion chart on altitude differences from flight ops on the briefing guide might be in order.
1873519,Immediately after takeoff from our departure airport; my student and I experienced significant unexpected turbulence and wind shear that causes us to make the decision to return to our departure airport. We were vectored for the ILS and intercepted the localizer at the proper altitude and were then cleared the visual approach. At that point we encountered even more significant wind shear and turbulence causing us to descend below the minimum altitude for an ILS approach. During the loss of altitude we had just switched to the Tower frequency and were cleared to land at which point Tower relayed a message from TRACON saying 'altitude alert' and that we were below the published altitude on the approach. I confirmed to Tower we had the field and terrain in sight and that we were unable to maintain altitude. Although a significant crosswind had picked up since our departure; an uneventful landing followed.
1896919,I refused [the] aircraft due to excessive MEL's that negatively affected flight safety being Dispatched into convective weather and rain with possible low ceilings at destination. Flight was dispatched away from a maintenance base with 6 MEL's of which when all tallied up affected multiple aircraft systems both on the ground and in flight. Notable systems were; loss of thrust reverser; loss of predictive Windshear; loss of auto start protections requiring manual start; loss of avionics bay cooling functions; loss of all nose gear lights(expected arrival time would have been dark or near dark) and loss of brake cooling among many others. Also it set the airplane up for a single point failure (failure of lcgiu1) for a complete loss of autopilot and flight director function in addition to the above. There is no good reason to send an aircraft in that condition with a full passenger load out of a heavy maintenance base into the weather conditions that were present at the time of scheduled departure. MEL's that were applied to aircraft were. XX-XX; XX-XXg; XX-XXb; XX-XXb; XX-XXa; and XX-XX.Causal factor is flight operations and maintenance failure to consider the excessive work load and backup system loss that resulted from this MEL combination being Dispatched into potentially heavy weather arriving at night. In addition the failure to consider the consequences of having another failure in flight with so many systems already degraded or inoperative. My suggestion is when these decisions are being made for the decision maker to ask themselves 'would I want my family on that airplane'. In the case of this aircraft; my bet their answer would be a definite no.
1881835,Aircraft X began with a report time of XA:15 local time at ZZZ with a destination of ZZZ1. Upon maintenance logbook review; two items of note were the INOP APU [for oil quantity I believe] and a #2 engine igniter INOP. These MEL items required an engine start at the gate with external air cart and a manual start for Engine #2. Aircraft was blocked with Engine 2 started at the gate under guidance from Section 7 reference material. Unable to cross bleed start in the alley the aircraft repositioned for a 'Cross bleed start' to taxi for departure. At this point the inflight called forward to inform us of a loss of all electrical power in in the cabin and trouble using the interphones. The galley power had shed and was only indicated by a note on the electrical page of the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor).  As per procedure I made a call to Dispatch and Maintenance Control for further direction. A description of the events was given to Maintenance Control and I asked for their direction to restore the galley bus. Under direction of Maintenance Control; I reset Sec 1; 2 and 3. I am unsure why the SECs would be used for the solution; but I defer to the knowledge of MX (Maintenance) Control. I never attempted to start the remaining engine which may have cured the problem; mostly because of the trouble with interphones and the unexpected galley issues. The call to MX Control was to get help in assessment of the failures and to find an easy solution. The reset was unsuccessful and Maintenance directed me to return to gate have the local maintenance fix the problem. Which to me indicated a larger aircraft systems problem.  In the hour of troubleshooting; the customers were left without air-conditioning and the cabin reached 90 degrees with many of the customers complaining of the heat. A water service was started by the inflight.  Back at the gate Maintenance was unable to reset the galley power by normal procedures and worked on the problem for one hour. The solution was to start both engines and the INOP APU; which MX started while still on MEL [the MEL was never cleared] at the gate along with a reset of the galley bus to restore galley function. I was told push off the gate with both engines as the solution. The aircraft was boarded and customers seated so we closed up received a new release and fuel summary for block out. The flight blocked out at XB:12 local.  At push back the wheel chocks were lodged in place and unable to be moved with both engines running. The push crew advised that we needed to shut an engine down to free the chocks. I asked for Maintenance on the interphone and a MX person answered on the tug comm. I advised that shutting down may cause the same galley problem and might result in a gate return a second time. Maintenance understood and recommended the Engine 2 shut down; to free the chocks; so Engine 2 was shut down.  With the chocks free the push continued with Engine 1 running which resulted in the same situation of loss of electrical aft of the cockpit. The push was stopped at my request and the aircraft towed into the gate at XB:22 local with the same MX problem and logbook entry.  I notified Dispatch of the return and a waited for further instructions from operations. At XC:00 local I called fatigued for the flight as a departure at this point would have had an arrival time of XD:00 local in ZZZ1 and I was not safe to operate the far into the red eye period.   I was never informed that all the failures might be normal and associated with the APU inop and single engine start. If so I would have continued with the normal operation and chock the situation up to my failure to recognize the associated failures.
1925095,Aircraft X returned to ZZZZ. The No 2 engine flamed out due fuel starvation caused by failure to complete the fuel manual checklist. The No 2 fuel quantity system was deferred by ZZZZ maintenance prior to departure.
1911146,During takeoff; a dirty gym sock smell came out of the cockpit air vents. Subsided around 3;000 ft AFE.
1898203,While in cruise; we heard a popping sound followed by a short hissing sound. To me it sounded like an O2 mask or line broke and then was slowly leaking. We looked around the for the source and the Captain discovered it was the Halon Fire Extinguisher by feeling air from the pressure gauge. After a moments pause of realizing what happened; the Captain directed us to put on our O2 masks and establish communication. Once we completed that; the Captain transferred the controls to me and started looking for the correct QRH procedure. There were no direct correlation procedures for our situation and so we choose to start at Smoke and Fumes checklist as it was the highest level of danger we could start with. The Captain did a great job of keeping the situation calm and at the right level of urgency. He contacted [Operations] and was then connected to [Maintenance Control] as well. [Maintenance Control] did not have any direct guidance available for our given situation. Next the Captain ran the Toxic Substance check list. This did not really apply because it was directed more towards a cabin problem. During the whole situation; the Captain asked how I was feeling and if I felt any effects of possible halon inhalation. I never felt any ill effects. [Maintenance Control] was unable to give us any good information on how long the Halon would last in the flight deck due to no procedures for this event. After about 20 minutes we felt it was safe to remove our O2 masks and continue to ZZZ. We made that decision based on not seeing any evidence of Halon discharge (we later discovered we were both mistaken on what that would look like); the discharge from the fire bottle seemed to have stopped (no sounds; no felt air coming from the previous spot and bottle pressure holding steady for the last 15 minutes); and after some additional information from [Maintenance Control]; we felt the air had sufficiently circulated through the flight deck. We both kept our O2 mask at hand and ready to don again if the bottle where to release again.The location of the fire extinguisher lends itself in inadvertent contact as crew and team members transit the flight deck. Meaning; as people get out of the left seat; they can be making contact with the bottle without noticing or as a way to stabilize them themselves if they lose balance getting out of the seat or the jumpseat. Over time it is conceivable that the gauge could lose structural integrity to the point of not being able to hold the correct pressure any longer. Suggestions to Prevent: none that I can think of now. It would have been helpful to have known what to expect when the bottle is discharged (i.e. powder versus clear gas; odor; effects; timing of effects.) A quick brief on what Halon looks like; how it effects the body and perhaps a review on if a QRH procedure might be needed might be a few ways to mitigate problems if this were to happen again.
1901569,Assigned heading 180 when cleared for takeoff ORD Runway 22L. Previous A320 departed. We departed with minimum separation. Airplane banked to 20-30 degrees uncommanded right and then left. I intervened by correcting aircraft bank angle. Flight continued as normal. [Inadequate] wake turbulence separation trailing an A320.
1891350,Aircraft was operating on an IFR flight plan in visual meteorological conditions to conduct a series of practice instrument approaches. The aircraft was supplied by the pilot flying who was the PIC and sole manipulator of the controls during the flight; and the sole operator of the radio communications with ATC. My role was to provide evaluation and instruction as necessary for the purpose of the flying pilot to obtain the certification of Instructor Pilot.  The flight was planned as a round robin flight originating at ZZZ and ending at ZZZ.  Intermediate approaches were planned at GCY; TRI and MOR. After completing a practice approach at GCY (a non towered airport) the flying pilot had reestablished radio contact with TRI Cities approach as instructed during the execution of the missed approach procedure. The pilot flying requested a practice ILS approach for Runway 23 at TRI.  TRI Cities advised the flying pilot to expect that approach issued vector instructions for ILS 23 at TRI. Radio traffic was extremely light and several minutes passed between communications between the controller and any other aircraft on frequency. While following a vector on the right downwind the pilot flying was instructed to contact approach on a different frequency. The pilot flying changed the radio frequency in use and reported on the new frequency.  The flying pilot was busy checking the ATIS as well as setting the TRI Tower frequency into standby on Com 1. Additionally the flying pilot was executing a partial panel approach with a simulated PFD (primary flight display) failure. As the aircraft reached a point a few miles from the anticipated right base vector I became concerned we hadn't heard a subsequent radio call and queried the flying pilot to verify he hadn't switched us off the correct frequency. After reviewing the approach chart he discovered he had made an entry error in the avionics. The pilot flying switched to the correct frequency and immediately advised ATC he had inadvertently been on the wrong frequency. ATC advised him he was below the MVA and instructed him to climb 600' and turn left to avoid terrain.  The pilot flying immediately acknowledged and complied with ATC's instructions. We were operating in VMC and had more than 1000' of clearance to any terrain or obstacle within several miles of the aircraft. At no time was the aircraft in danger of imminent collision with any terrain or obstacles.  ATC advised the pilot flying of possible pilot deviation due to operation of the aircraft below MVA while on an IFR fight plan. Post flight debrief discussion and review revealed the pilot read back the correct frequency; but incorrectly entered the frequency in the avionics. Neither the pilot flying or myself realized ATC did not acknowledge the pilot's frequency change. Intercom communication as well as the pilots approach and landing workload interfered with early identification of the data error.  A contributing factor was the unusually quiet radio communications with any other aircraft during the early vectors. This resulted in the pilots not immediately noticing a state of change with the current communications with ATC. In the future no frequency change will be assumed to have been correctly made unless positive acknowledgment by ATC has been received. I was not making the radio calls; and my expectation bias led me to believe the pilot flying would have made a subsequent verification call if he had not received acknowledgment of a correct frequency switch.
1904929,Was flying VFR on a sightseeing trip around Michigan and had a near miss with a small hobby drone that was far higher than allowed. I (the PIC) did not spot the drone but it was spotted by the passenger sitting in the right seat. The passenger described the drone as being close enough to see the individual rotors clearly (it seems to have been the common four rotor type of drone similar to the ones sold by DJI) and could make out the individual lights on the drone clearly). The aircraft I was flying was at 2;500 ft MSL at the time (roughly 1;800 ft AGL). The passenger's guess was that the drone was within 100 feet vertically (below) and 200 feet horizontally (to the right). Note that the passenger is not a pilot but that the passenger being close enough to make out the individual components of the drone would indicate that it was very close. Despite my scan for traffic; I was not able to spot the drone before or after the encounter. The passenger said he only saw it because he happened to be looking in the right direction at the right time. From my understanding drones are limited to 400 feet AGL; this drone was far higher than that and in violation of the regulations. Many drones now feature a software limit to prevent them from flying higher than that which would suggest that the drone was purposefully flashed with software intended to break the height regulations.
1900749,Ferry flight; ZZZ2-ZZZ3. Aircraft X. Roughly 8 minutes after takeoff; BLEED TRIP OFF light illuminated. Run the QRH and finally directed us to turn off the affected side PACK; which was the left pack. Few seconds after turning off the left PACK; the right PACK light comes on. We were cleared by ATC for FL280; at that moment stopped at FL200 and Request descend and back to ZZZ1.We were cleared direct to ZZZ1 and decent to 10;000 ft. by ATC. We read the check list for right PACK light ;while we were on the check list; Cabin Altitude warning horn activated during descend; CABIN ALT exceeded above 15;000 ft. and passenger oxygen masks deployed. We read the check list for (Cabin altitude or rapid decompression) we use oxygen mask until 10;000 feet. Didn't [request priority handling] because situation was on the control.We didn't see any PACK overheat indication on the ground and before takeoff. Approximately 8 minutes after takeoff we noticed with the first indication which was left BLEED TRIP light followed by right PACK light. Had 45 minutes ground stop in ZZZ2. PACK was running for cooling purposes and cause PACK overheat in flight.We decided to stop climbing at FL200; and run the check list for left BLEED TRIP light. Eventually QRH directed us to shut down the left PACK; immediately after that the right PACK light comes on; at that point we decided to request descend to lower altitude and back to ZZZ1. We definitely need some equipment on the ground to keep the airplane cool during summer especially in hot airports.
1896840,After takeoff from ZZZ while climbing through 11;000 ft MSL; the First Officer and I smelled smoke and noticed a smoky haze in the cockpit. We then received a call from the A-Flight Attendant who said there was smoke in the cabin. We leveled off at 14;000 ft and [requested priority handling] with Center and received vectors back to ZZZ. I asked the First Officer to run the Smoke; Fire or Fumes Non-normal checklist while I flew the aircraft; talked to ATC and text messaged Dispatch through ACARS. After we turned off the galley power switches; the smoke seemed to dissipate. I asked ATC to have the Fire Department standing by upon arrival. While being vectored for the ILS to Runway XXR I checked in with the Flight Attendants to verify that the smoke was dissipating in the cabin and they assured me it was. We landed uneventfully. After landing I checked with the Flight Attendants again and asked if they saw any reason to evacuate; they said no; the smoke was almost gone. We decided to taxi to the gate where we deplaned and called Dispatch and Maintenance. We were unable to determine the source of the smoke.
1899719,During the descent on the arrival into ZZZ we got an AIR BLEED 2 abnormal ECAM. I flew the plane and the captain followed the procedure. About 5 minutes later around 9000-10000 ft. the engine page appeared on the ECAM and the IDG Temp was flashing green. We noticed it get to 146 degrees. This was also on the number 2 engine. Due to these problems happening so close together we [advised ATC] and got the plane on the ground with no incident. The ground equipment followed us to the gate and there were no other issues.Air Bleed issue and then an IDG problem. We did not want more issues to occur with that engine. We were close to ZZZ and already on the radio with approach; so we continued to ZZZ. I do not know what can stop an air bleed or IDG problem.
1866297,Flight diversion occurred to ZZZ due to an enroute failure of the APU Generator. The #1 engine generator was initially on placard bringing the flight down to one single AC power source. No non-normal situation exists in the Flight Manual; but is trained that a single AC sources requires diversion to the nearest suitable airport. The Dispatcher contacted the Operations Manager immediately after the flight crew reported the event. I was notified of the event by calling the Dispatch to inquire about the flight status when [Software Program] alerted that the flight destined to ZZZ1 was diverting to ZZZ1; which was incorrect; but usually indicates something abnormal may be happening.Per 737 Flight Manual 'Landing at Nearest Suitable Airport' section; there are specific situations where pilot should plan to land at the nearest suitable airport to include 'Electrical - Only one AC power source remains.' No calls were made to the Maintenance Director or Chief Dispatcher until the diversion was in progress. Per the Dispatcher's Manual under the Dispatch Emergency/Irregular Checklist the Dispatcher should notify the Maintenance Director if the diversion to the nearest suitable airport is required. This also is in direct contravention to the Dispatcher's Manual for notification of any inflight notification of mechanical issues as well as the Dispatchers Manual Notification during irregular operations.The Flight Crew did [request priority handling] on arrival which was only discovered after I requested the Dispatcher get briefed by the flight. Failure to notify the Maintenance Director could have resulted in the [Company process] not being issued or company indication via Company process that [priority was requested] for a Operator flight.I have spoken with the Dispatcher for the flight to discuss the events in a post-review. After arrival in ZZZ the Director asked if I would issue the [Company Process]. I replied in the affirmative and requested the Director to have the Operations Managers advise the Maintenance Director when a similar significant event occurs. I was answered with silence.
1919460,Electrical system failure in flight: I positioned a Aircraft X from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 for a Part 91 skydiving operation at the edge of the ZZZ2 Class D and under a ZZZ3 Class B shelf. Prior to the operations NOTAMs had been filed and I spoke with ZZZ TRACON about the plan; as well as advised ZZZ2 Tower of the operations that would be happening at the edge of their airspace. I departed with the jumpers; climbed to 2000 ft. MSL for a low pass to assess winds; and then climbed to 3500 ft. MSL. Shortly after departure I contacted ZZZ Approach on the radio; received a squawk; and had been identified on radar. During the climb to 3500 ft. MSL I lost my GPS/Comm 1 radio; then quickly lost my Comm 2 radio before I could switch over frequencies to that. The transponder also died before I could squawk XXXX. Each piece of equipment died quickly; one after the other. I continued to assess the situation while I circled overhead the drop zone as the jumpers prepared to jump. I called our company on the phone to help find a number for ZZZ2 Tower to let them know I was inbound NORDO. We were unable to find a Tower phone number so I called clearance delivery; the only ATC phone number for ZZZ2 in the iPad; to explain that I had a complete electrical failure and I asked for a relay to let ZZZ2 Tower know I was currently in a high right downwind for Runway XX. I had a moving map on my tablet using the iPad and was able to see other traffic on there; as well as visually acquire that traffic. I saw the traffic make a turn away from the area; which led me to assume that Tower had directed them out of the area to prioritize me. I did not look to see a light gun from the Tower at the time but did identify a fire truck near the runway intersection; which was another confirmation of my priority. The landing was uneventful and I taxied clear toward a FBO hangar and talked with the fire department personnel. Upon further inspection; I identified a broken belt on the alternator. The weather that day was going to be challenging with convective weather all around. The destination (ZZZ2) was experiencing strong thunderstorms about the time of my planned departure time; with only about an hour long flight. I decided to delay the departure about 30-45 minutes; but then I experience a thunderstorm at ZZZ1 when I wanted to depart. Ultimately; I was able to safely depart after the storm had passed and dissipated; and the positioning leg was uneventful; however; we were behind schedule. It was my first flight through the ZZZ3 Class Bravo so I flight planned quite extensively. This mitigation also helped with understanding the airspace in which we were operating and facilitated a safe landing at ZZZ2 after the electrical failure. There was a small amount of '-itis' to get the job done; especially with the weather delays; but I felt that weather hazards and external pressures were ultimately mitigated. In the event of another NORDO scenario; ensure that the Tower is providing the proper light gun signals before assuming it is safe to land.
1899014,[There was a] ski bag leak. Ski bag checked in contained black liquid either paint or ink. Bag leaked out on other suitcases and ramp staff. Bag left behind and passenger informed.
1920802,Approaching cruise after initial climb out at FL200 we received a L HYD QTY Message. We referenced the QRH which did not have any corrective steps. The L Hydraulic Quantity was seen decreasing; with the magenta 'RF' visible. Shortly thereafter we got the L HYD SYS PRESS Message; the aircraft began a slow roll to the right. Pilot Flying turned off the left autopilot to stabilize the aircraft and then engaged the center autopilot; which operated as expected. We [requested priority handling]; got cleared direct ZZZZZ to hold as published for ZZZ ILS XX approach and began a descent to 5;000 feet. We completed QRH and began configuring to land and saw that the flaps/slats were not moving according to the indicator; though it felt like flaps were extending. We also had to perform the alternate gear extension; and decided to land at ZZZ1 since it had a 11;000 foot runway and we wanted to ensure a safe landing. With checklists complete we received vectors and landed uneventfully on Runway XY. We taxied onto Taxiway B to clear the runway and shutdown there. Loss of all left hydraulic fluid and pressure due to unknown issue.
1892114,Inbound to ZZZ; crew received a slat disagree warning. They requested priority handling and landed safely. Maintenance is evaluating. Crash Fire Rescue trucks did roll.
1890332,During climbout at approximately FL240; the First Officer's windshield R1 suddenly cracked. It was determined to be the outer layer of the window. We immediately leveled off; and asked ATC for a return. We ran the appropriate Quick Reference Handbook Checklist and Diversion Checklist. Dispatch seemed to immediately know that something wasn't right and we responded to their message confirming an air return. We notified the Flight Attendants first; then the passengers telling them exactly what had happened and why we were returning to Denver.We did not request priority handling but ATC began to refer to us as a critical aircraft so we went with that assuming that they had declared priority handling for us. We made an uneventful smooth overweight landing. There were multiple emergency vehicles lined along the runway as we landed. Logbook entries were made for both the cracked windshield; and the overweight landing specifying the smooth landing and a brakes-on speed of 65 kts. Dispatch and Maintenance Control were called at the gate. Another aircraft had been designated for the continuation of the flight. The First Officer and I determined that we were okay to continue to operate the [next] flight.
1891758,Prior to takeoff from Runway 28R/N5; ORD Tower gave a clearance to turn RIGHT heading 040. Takeoff clearance was acknowledged and takeoff roll was initiated.  The aircraft departing ahead of us was a Boeing 757; which departed on the same exact path as we did. Our takeoff clearance was received as the 757 was ROTATING. Both pilots immediately recognized the wake turbulence hazard associated with a 757; especially when following so close. Right after takeoff at about 200 ft.; we encountered pretty strong wake which caused a rolling moment to the right. The PF (Pilot Flying) properly initiated a left turn to try to avoid the dangerous path. Upon stabilizing the airplane and returning to normal flight; we received a radio call from ATC stating that we were supposed to turn right; to which I replied: do you want us to go left or right? ATC responded with the word: ACTUALLY. Not being sure of what that meant; I asked them again; which way did they want us to turn. ATC then said 'turn right all the way 040 heading'. We then continued as planned and no further incident occurred.Two parts on this. Both pilots lost situational awareness as to what the initial clearance to turn was; due to being caught up in trying to avoid the wake turbulence. Also; the crew could have asked for a short delay on the runway; as soon as the threat was detected prior to takeoff. On the other hand; I'm not exactly sure what the minimum separation is when taking off behind a 757; but I feel like this take off clearance was rushed. Fatigue could also have (unknowingly) played a factor in this.
1903522,Gear unsafe light illuminated in initial descent into ZZZ. Ran checklist for unsafe gear. Slowed to 200 KIAS. Changed destination to ZZZ1. Advised ATC. Gear extended normally and normal landing was made at ZZZ1 with fire trucks on standby.  Service center is working the issue.
1897712,Climbing thru 13;000 [ft.] I noticed that the cabin was not pressurizing correctly it was over pressurized for our altitude. So I halted the climb; asked to remain at 13;000. Center said descent to 10;000 I did so; and did some trouble shooting; asked my FO (First Officer) to call for return to ZZZ1. We returned contacted Maintenance. Did not exit the aircraft. Went thru checklist and it turned out to be a sticky bleed valve switch and by cycling them it fixed our issue. I did NOT [request priority]. Tower said because I returned it warranted one. We took back off on a new FP (Flight Plan) then around 14;000 checked to make sure everything was normal and it was so we continued with our day.
1886560,Aircraft X checked in with me; working the final sector; direct a fix on the RNAV XXR approach that we do not normally send aircraft to. They were direct that fix to go behind an unidentified VFR target. Because of this I pulled up the approach plate on the ACE-IDS above me to make sure I was giving a correct clearance and could ensure the aircraft was flying the approach correctly. I cleared Aircraft X to cross ZZZZZ at 5000 ft. and cleared for the RNAV XXR approach. The Pilot read back correctly except he read back Runway XYR. I reissued the approach clearance to clarify the assigned runway; since there is no XY at ZZZ1. The pilot again read back Runway XYR and I verified that he was landing XXR at ZZZ1 and he corrected to the correct approach and runway. Aircraft Y checked in on the downwind and I gave a vector for Runway 30 and altitude of 5000 ft. expecting to turn base over top of Aircraft X when he reached ZZZZZ1 at 3400 ft. I descended Aircraft Y to 3400 ft. when I meant 4400 ft. and didn't catch the readback because it was what I had said and I was starting to notice Aircraft X doing something out of the normal. I noticed that Aircraft X was not tracking at ZZZZZ2; and looked up to confirm with the plate; then asked the Pilot to verify he was still on the approach. As he was responding to this query I saw he was continuing his descent below the MVA and next fix on the approach. I immediately issued a low altitude alert; canceled the approach clearance and climbed the aircraft to a safe altitude. I noticed that Aircraft Y was descending past 4400 ft. and so I turned south to go behind the climbing Aircraft X. I asked the Aircraft X if he had the field in sight for a visual approach to which he said no and then responded in the affirmative so I cleared him for the visual approach. I also cleared the Aircraft Y for the visual approach also.After speaking with the Pilot; the Supervisor reported the aircraft had been looking at his iPad and when I asked if he was tracking the approach; looked up and dropped the iPad; in retrieving it the airplane dived and the low altitude alert gave him the alert needed to climb the aircraft to a safe altitude. [Recommendation:] there were multiple contributing factors but none that could be changed due to the split second decisions that happen every day.
1893029,During descent on the ZZZZZ1 arrival into ZZZ; and just after passing 17000 ft. the aircraft began an uncommanded roll to the right. The autopilot was on and the warning system said 'roll authority ' and displayed the red warning 'roll authority ' on the Primary Flight Display. I announced 'upset' and clicked off the Auto Pilot and applied left aileron to counter the bank. I stabilized the aircraft and shortly thereafter got into more wake that required right bank to keep the aircraft steady.The Captain notified ATC about the wake turbulence; and we were given a heading of 210 to get us away from the direct path of what we learned was a heavy 777. ATC turned us right to 280 and before completing the turn cleared us direct ZZZZZ2. We did not encounter any additional wake turbulence and landed uneventfully on Runway XYR.
1883806,Flying back from ZZZ; usual route is tank farm to ZZZ1 per school policy. Light rain began and crackling on the headsets near tank farm. We descended circling over the tank farm from 3;500 MSL to 2;000 MSL and reduced our speed to see if it improved. No change. We attempted to contact ZZZ1 with our position and got only crackling. Weather info was recorded via foreflight. We squawked 7600 and ident; then proceeded inbound for a left base Runway XX the usual instruction in this weather condition. Watched ADS-B and saw no traffic; proceeded with caution. Requested light signals and rocked our wings. Ident again. First pass was a go-around because no light signals were received. Radioed Tower on climb requesting light signals; mentioning we had no radio reception. Made left traffic. No traffic in sight or on ADS-B. Light signals received on second attempt at final Runway XX. Solid green. Landed; turn off Taxiway 1. Flashing green. After-landing configuration; then proceeded the usual taxi route Taxiway 2; 3; 4 to FBO Ramp.
1923534,We were inflight and out of sterile when the Captain called me while I was about half way through the beverage service. He said that there was an issue with the nose gear door opened and we had to return to ZZZ asap. He did not declare an emergency and told me that we would be doing normal landing procedures. We both made an announcement and I discontinued service and prepared the cabin for landing. Once at the Gate we deplaned the passengers and the plane went to the hangar for maintenance.
1893522,IFR departure from ZZZ; Mooney M20C; weather: wind 190@8 knots; VIS 10; skies clear; Pilot Flying in left front seat and passenger in front right seat. Provided a passenger safety briefing using the SAFETY acronym. Run up checks completed; no issues noted. Pre-takeoff safety briefing completed including runway to be used; type of takeoff; V speeds; actions and runways to be used in case of engine failure or mechanical concerns. Takeoff safety briefing and surface winds both indicated a favorable emergency return to Runway XX; as this would require less than 180 degrees of turn to line up. ATC cleared for takeoff Runway XYR; verified correct runway; applied takeoff power; verified engine RPM and manifold pressure correct; verified all engine gauges in the green; verified airspeed alive. Rotate at Vr 70 mph; then pitch for Vy 100 MPH; approximately 50 feet AGL detected uncommanded engine RPM increase exceeding 2;700 RPM. Pulled the propeller control to reduce RPM; detected this had no effect. Reduced manifold pressure in order to reduce engine RPM below red line. Informed ATC of a mechanical issue and need to return to the airport; now passing through approximately 300 feet AGL. Instructed by ZZZ Tower to make right traffic Runway XYR and read back the instructions. Moments later noticed engine oil pressure reduction to near zero pressure. Combination of low oil pressure and lack of propeller control suggests an engine oil leak in the governor system. Decided it was prudent for safety of flight not to fly standard traffic pattern as instructed by ATC out of concern of low oil pressure possibly resulting in engine failure during the several minutes required to fly the pattern. Passing approximately over the departure end of Runway XYR at approximately 400 ft. AGL [received priority] in order to deviate from ATC instructions and minimize the time in flight due to concerns of engine failure; informed ATC of intentions to land on Runway XX. ATC promptly provided landing clearance for any runway. Maneuvered to line up with Runway XX while maintaining appropriate safe airspeed using partial engine power. Quick check for landing gear down and added landing flaps. Landed normally approximately midfield Runway XX; comfortably taxied off on [Taxiway] 1. Informed ATC of intentions to taxi back to parking; but observed zero oil pressure during after-landing checklist and detected odor of burning oil. Stopped the aircraft in the non-movement area directly ahead of [Taxiway] 1 shut down the aircraft and evacuated. After evacuation observed the engine cowling; bottom of fuselage and some of the wing surfaces coated in engine oil. No fire occurred; no injury to persons on board or on the ground; no damage to airport structures. Successful outcome can be partially attributed to detailed pre-takeoff safety briefing including actions in case of engine failure and intended emergency runway to be used. Additionally; continuous and careful monitoring of instruments and engine gauges during critical phase of flight allowed for rapid detection of engine irregularities.
1876736,While setting up to land behind arriving traffic at ZZZ; I noticed a fast moving jet coming directly at me. I took evasive action (as did they) and turned to the right without further incident.
1911498,I landed at ZZZ with my students after the first half of a dual paired flight. I was very excited by the progress of my student and was talking with them both as I went to park on the T nearest the FBO. I swung in too close to a black light post and my wing cleared or barely didn't clear the post. My student says he saw it hit. I inspected the post with a ZZZ employee and we found no damage and we all looked at the wing and saw no damage. I went inside and immediately called Name to inform him about what happened. He left it in my judgement to continue to fly. I carefully reinspected the wing; aileron paddle and could find no damage or scratches. We continued the flight without incident.Set a better example of sterile cockpit on taxi and park first before trying to share my excitement with my student.
1902524,Left engine vibration while at cruise altitude 9;000 MSL. Shut down engine; ran checklist for loss of power. Told ATC of my situation and diverted to ZZZ.
1929741,I departed ZZZ1 enroute to ZZZ in Cessna Centurion T210 IFR with no passengers. On arrival I requested radar vectors to the RNAV (GPS) Runway XX approach. While I was being vectored; I noted a complete loss of radio communication with Approach Control. I did not hear a vector to the final approach course and no clearance for the approach.  The failure was intermittent and I could hear a word or two intermittently. Multiple attempts at restoring communication were not successful. I re-positioned the aircraft back towards the airport and managed to establish some communication with a Controller intermittently. He vectored me around some traffic and then cleared me for a visual approach to Runway XX.  Unfortunately; the communication difficulties distracted me and I failed to lower the landing gear. No gear warning horn sounded. I had the gear warning horn worked on about ten days prior to this flight. A gear up landing was made with no injuries.Partial radio failure intermittent [was] due to poor connection of headset. No FARs violated. Distraction and failure of gear warning horn resulted in gear up landing.
1868240,GSP ATCT advised ZTL that they would be closing at XA:30 local for a COVID cleaning at that ZTL would be assuming the airspace. There was debate about which sector/sectors would assume the airspace based on the contingency plan but eventually it was decided that it would be divided up as is usually done on the midnight shift. When GSP ATCTC closed; The ARTS entry was not made to ensure that hand offs could be properly forwarded to the correct sectors and a through briefing of which VFR towers were still open was not given leaving areas of confusion about who were and were not open after the airspace was assumed. The automation issue of the ARTS entry caused each hand off to be verbally coordinated within the airspace as well as manually tracking up each hand off leading to increased and unneeded complexity and coordination. Staffing was also an issue as 2 CPC's and the only Supervisor on duty in the area were given annual leave during the shift leaving the area short when the GSP closure took place and a CIC was left to work the unusual situation. This resulted in the 3 sectors being combined with multiple frequencies as well as high complexity from working CLT inbounds and departures in addition to the GSP inbounds and departures at the same time. We are not an approach control and cannot provide the level of efficiency or safety of an approach control during the hours when the approach control is suppose to be open. We are limited by the rules we must adhere to and cannot provide the level of service that the users are accustomed to during this time of day. This was not a COVID emergency or an evacuation. The cleaning should have been conducted after the normal closing hours of GSP ATCT to minimize impact on the operation of ZTL as well as the users. There is no reason why this could not have been done after midnight when GSP ATCT is normally closed. If it was based on the cost of not holding someone at GSP over for an overtime shift; then safety was put behind cost by the agency; and the ATM of GSP ATCT should have volunteered to personally stay him or herself. There were a few unsafe situations and unneeded stress on ZTL brought on by this closure and cleaning that could have been delayed by a few hours. The supervisor on duty should also not have been allowed to leave early given the unusual and complex nature of the situation.
1885256,I was working with Avionics Tech Name; we accomplished both Task Cards. XX-XXXX-X-XXXX and XX-XXXX-XXXY. This was a quick turn back to terminal. I signed off both job cards on my IPAD and realized that I made the mistake of signing for both EEC (Electronic Engine Control) 1 and 2 existing fault checks that were ETOPS issued work. I should have Read and understand task card.
1895512,On taxi out; there was a split in N1 on FMC. Tried to reset pack and bleed. N1 matched but then would split again. Decided to takeoff and check in the air. We took off Runway XXR. N1 was slightly split on takeoff. Climbed out and noticed right pack producing 10 PSI. Pressurization was a bit erratic but pressurizing. Decided to contact Dispatch and M/C. Explained situation and M/C said we could continue. I asked about maintenance in ZZZ1 and if the problem could be deferred. M/C said if Duct pressure was less than 20 psi in cruise then it would be non dispatchable. We leveled at FL310 and the right duct pressure was still 10 psi. I thought it would not make sense to continue and have the aircraft grounded in ZZZ1. DISCUSSED WITH DISPATCH AND BEST course of action was to return to ZZZ2. NORMAL LANDING and taxi to gate. I wish I had not taken off and contacted M/C to discuss the split N1. I was a little rushed and knew a delay could possibly result in legality problems coming home.
1887618,After departure from ZZZ; our landing gear was showing the mains up and locked with the nose wheel still unlocked. We were briefed to recycle the gear to fix the issue. Upon recycling the gear; the nose was still showing unlocked. Now; the mains were locked and the nose was unlocked. The gear handle was now stuck in the down position with a weight on wheels miscompare message showing on the CAS. We ran the appropriate checklist and tried pulling the D ring handle to get the nose unlocked. This did not work. We did a low pass to verify the indication and the Ops crew verified our nose wheel was still up. We asked to fly around for a bit to make calls to our company. After exhausting our options to get the nose down; we maneuvered aggressively to try to get it down. We were eventually able to get it down and land safely. All messages on the CAS cleared. Priority was given to us to maneuver around the ZZZ1 area. Approach; Tower; Ground and Ops did everything they could to help us. The crew in the plane used CRM to reach out to outside sources for help. The aircraft manufacturer maintenance was communicating with us to help with ideas. In the end; it turned out well. Crew; passengers and plane were safe.
1910624,Approximately around XA:20z climbing though FL380 for FL400; we got a level two alert for Tail Fuel Pumps LO. At this time the PF was told to continue flying and the PIC  and Relief Pilot;  will conduct the Quick Reference Hand book; abnormal procedures fuel 'Tail Pumps Lo' procedure. We conducted the procedure getting to the turn on tail tank alt pump switch 'on'; it was only green for about 30 seconds and went amber. There was 1;450 kilograms of fuel in tail tank and we had another alert 'Alt Tail Pump Lo'. At this point the aircraft is leveling off at FL400. The fuel flow looked normal for all three engines but when the power was moving back for cruse setting the number 2 engine just continued to roll back to flight ideal with 0 fuel flow. At this point the PIC asked ATC for FL340 to work of fuel issue. The procedure was completed by this point and the PIC asked crew if they would like to attempt a restart or just return to ZZZZ. PIC agreed with crew to return due to the close distance to ZZZZ and the ability to have any services need at this location. The PIC asked for the Engine shutdown in flight Procedure. Once completed the PIC loaded the ZZZZ ILS XXL approach in the flight computer. The PF briefed the approach and the aircraft landed with no further issues.
1878153,As I entered left downwind for Runway XX [at] ZZZ I saw an aircraft departing Runway XX. I heard a mumbled radio call and was able to make out 'departure'. The aircraft turned left and I heard another mumbled call and was able to make out 'crosswind'. I then saw the aircraft heading toward me and it seemed to be gaining on me rapidly.I had made a call 2 miles NE of the [landmark] followed by another call directly over the [landmark]. I also called downwind. All my calls included 'aeronca' so other aircraft could appreciate that I would be slower. When I realized the other aircraft may not have me in sight I made 2 more calls trying to get them to LOOK. As they closed on me I made an aggressive climb above traffic pattern altitude. They passed directly under me - from my 7 o'clock to my 2 o'clock; about 100 ft. vertical.This was a flight school aircraft. This flight school caters to foreign students and apparently they really do not understand English. They seem to know the calls they need to make for the pattern but do not seem to comprehend what is going on around them. Looking at their flight aware tracking - they never reduced power to fly the pattern. I went into the flight school to speak with the chief CFI but no one was available. As I spoke with the front desk personnel; some of the foreign students overheard and started talking in their foreign language. I have heard them use non English on CTAF. I really think the school needs to strongly prohibit the use of any non English anytime they are on the property or in an airplane. Their radio transmissions are often very difficult to understand. They also need to teach about reducing power while in the pattern. When an aircraft has a slower and constant speed; it is easier to spot other traffic. My aircraft is a legacy aircraft without [an] engine driven electrical system and is exempt from ADS-B requirements. I wonder if they were looking at Fore Flight or some other display to see traffic instead of looking out the window.
1910425,Possibly experienced severe carburetor icing during flight; in 70+ degree weather and about 50% humidity. During the procedures of pulling the carb heat; the aircraft continue to sputter; and when adding mixture the aircraft engine shut off; was able to restart in-flight and land at the nearest airport; with no damage to aircraft or personnel.
1868750,As we were switched over to Bogota FIR; it was very hard to understand the Controller because there was a high pitched squeal on the radio. I felt like my SA (Situational Awareness) started to go down at this point because I was focusing on trying to understand the Controller. I misunderstood multiple clearances and had to ask twice for the clearance. We were given the RNAV RNP X 31L. The Captain and I had briefed and gone over the points on both the STAR and approach multiple times each. We were finally headed to AMVES when we were cleared direct to BO710. We briefed [that] we were going to do our LAVS 1 nm prior to this point. 1 nm mile prior the Captain rolled in 8400 feet in the MCP alt window. For some reason we were stuck in VNAV ALT. She selected 500 fpm down on the VS to get us going down and quickly selected VNAV again. We were high on the path and realized we were past the final approach point about the same time we got a terrain caution. The Captain called for a go around at this point. I think there were many contributing factors that led to this event. First of all I have less than 75 hours in the airplane as well as having never been to Bogota before. My SA started going down when we started to have communication issues [with] Bogota center. I had trouble understanding clearances which contributed to my task saturation. We briefed and checked points multiple times on the first approach going into [Runway] 31 as well as the LAVS procedure. I think since we had such a high ground speed between high altitude and tail wind that may have caused us to be high on the path before we had a chance to get on it. Taking the clearance direct to BO710 as opposed to taking direct AMVES did us no favors. I was task saturated and unfortunately was not as good of a backup as I should have been.
1910429,I approached runway XX at ZZZ for landing in a Cessna 172. The landing appeared normal after the wheels touched the ground; the plane; however; was about 4 ft to the left of the center line. I slowly pressed the right rudder pedal to direct the plane to the center line. After seeing the plane turn right; I slowly used the left rudder pedal to gently offset the turn to the right but the plane did not respond. It continued turning to the right for nearly two seconds longer than I wanted it to; by the time I regained my left rudder usage; the plane was already near the edge of the runway on its way to a grassy area between taxiway Lima and taxiway Hotel. I did not want to over-correct to the left since I was concerned the plane would flip over. I managed to stop the plane at Alpha in front of the FBO. The plane did not collide with any person or thing. ZZZ ATC asked if I needed any assistance; I was unharmed so I declined the offer.I parked the plane and inspected the exterior. The only damage I noticed was to the 'tail skid;' the aftermarket metal attachment designed to protect the tail of the plane in the event of a tail strike.  It was bent and turned toward the right front of the plane near the right rudder. I noticed scuff marks on the rudder's right side (pilot's right); the full movement of the right rudder was inhibited by the twisted Tail Skid. I proceeded into the ZZZ FBO to call my flight instructor. He informed me that he would call me back in 20 minutes after conferring with the management at the flight school. While I was waiting; I requested a mechanic at the FBO to look at the plane.During this time; I was approached by a gentleman; he identified himself as part of flight operations at ZZZ. He asked for my personal information; I provided all that he requested.I was told by the mechanic that the plane could not fly until the damaged Tail Skid was removed.  He said the rest of the plane appears unaffected and because this is an aftermarket and unnecessary part for the plane; it was safe to fly again.Upon reflection; it is likely that I over-flared the landing incurring a tail strike and damaging the Tail Skid. The Tail Skid twisted and turned toward the right side which ultimately locked the right rudder very briefly into place during the landing roll on the runway.
1933727,On climbout of ZZZ smelled a food burning smell. I thought Flight Attendant (FA) was cooking our crew meals. Got a call from FA later during climb that smell was strong throughout cabin. First Officer (FO) then said he saw a bird go by on climbout that he thought we may have hit. After discussing issue with Operations and Maintenance control via crew phone; I decided to return to ZZZ and land overweight per their suggestion and the fact that we had the fume event happening. [Priority handling was requested] for overweight landing and bird strike on takeoff. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was called out and they followed us to gate inspecting the engine for damage and to ensure no fire ignited. Passengers were deplaned. Got a new plane and departed for ZZZ1 again 4 hours late. Bird strike was in number #1 engine as evidenced by blood and feather debris noted by us and maintenance on post flight walk around. This was written up in Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML). Overweight landing was written up in AML with required parameters also. Another AML write up was done for item not related to this event as well.No suggestions.
1898630,Departing APV Runway 18; I left traffic pattern westward in the upwind following Aircraft Y also departing. Immediate west departure was for safety as additional aircraft were attempting left downwind entry of 18 at APV. Nearly immediately after turning west; I received a terrain advisory on a garment 430 NAV. The warning would not clear and I continued to follow departing traffic as I was clear of terrain but between two hills southwest of APV. For safety; I continued to focus on climbing to altitude and departing traffic rather than continue to clear the warning from the 430.I noticed I was in VCV airspace when followed departing traffic began to descend and I looked down to see an aviation boneyard. I immediately turned east to vacate the airspace and began to clear terrain message to obtain VCV Tower frequency. Although; VCV's airspace was not 'busy'; my concern is that the persistent terrain message can make it difficult for pilots to identify Class D airspace and be problematic if airspace is more congested.
1928166,On short final; left engine sputtered and failed. Prop windmilled until plane touched down and then stopped in feathered position. Prop was able to feather and unfeather normally during run-up. Failure happened on lap 3 of a maintenance flight in the pattern after annual inspection. Did not [request priority handling] as incident occurred with such short time to react. Focus was on landing safely. Airplane was able to taxi on one engine to the parking spot. Post flight inspection did not reveal any loss of oil or leak on any areas visible from outside.
1883718,At around XA:30 local; I was holding short of [runway]. Given a clearance to lineup and wait. As student pilot taxied onto [runway]; I did a final look over of aircraft. I noticed a fuel leak off the right wing and a large wet spot where we were holding short. I hadn't noticed this prior to this point. At that point; I took controls and asked Tower for taxi clearance back to the ramp. I was given a canceled T/O clearance; taxi ahead to [taxiway] 1 and hold short of 2. Switched to Ground and was asked if I needed assistance. I stated no; just taxi back to ramp for a small fuel drip. Told not to taxi with a fuel leak and to shut down. Eventually; an airport authority truck came by to inspect; told ATC it was minimal; and I was given clearance to start up and taxi back. Several vehicles were deployed and many aircraft were rerouted as [taxiways] were shutdown. On a separate note; I forgot to switch on all lights when crossing [runway] on the way back in. I did complete a visual check and check on map. Made it a teaching moment for student. Always remember to stay focused and calm during tense situations so that nothing small is missed. Not sure what could have been done to prevent fuel issue. With regards to forgetting to turn on lights during runway crossing; always remain calm during tense situations.
1920783,After having flow from ZZZ1 to ZZZ for a quick turn; we kept the APU running and aircraft cool and comfortable without any issues. Upon pushing back; we received a ground stop notice for ZZZ1 and conferred with Dispatch to continue. After starting #1 engine; Ground Control held us on the ramp for approximately 15 minutes. We had the APU bleed on as well as both packs on (standard southeast taxi configuration). No issues at that time. Upon taxi out clearance; a heavy rain started and with just a small application of power to engine #1 to start the taxi we noticed a faint dirty socks smell as we joined the taxiway out. At that same moment Ground Control notified us that the ground stop was lifted and we started the 2nd engine start sequence. During that time the smell got worse and we were notified by the Flight Attendants of the smell. After shutting down the APU there was absolutely no change and the odor continued to get stronger. We tried to isolate the packs individually to no avail. At that time we told Ground we needed to return to the gate and coordinated with Dispatch and Operations. On the taxi back; the Flight Attendants said the smell was super strong in the aft part of the aircraft and that the aft Flight Attendant was feeling nauseous. I immediately shutdown both packs which started an improvement. The aft Flight Attendant requested to have medical attention at the gate and we arranged for it. Ramp was shut down due to lighting; but Company was able to get us in via a marshaling vehicle. Once at the gate; the aft Flight Attendant got medical attention while we unloaded without any passenger issues. Afterwards; all the Flight Attendants sought to be checked out by a medical facility.Purely a mechanical issue that occasionally plagues the airbus. No improper action lead to this issue. Airbus has had these issues for far too long to not have found a permanent fix or redesign. At what point will health concerns outweigh cost?
1877481,Departure deviation following heavy Widebody after takeoff.[Runway] 8R cleared for takeoff behind heavy Widebody aircraft.Weather conditions after takeoff; night VFR winds out of southeast 45 knots at 1400 ft. MSL.From rotation to about 4;500 ft. in and out of wake turbulence from preceding heavy Wide body aircraft. Just climbing through 1;000 feet FO (First Officer) stated 'we've dumped our departure route' out of the box/FMC.  [We responded by] putting in JAMBA; first waypoint on SID; back in box and then KBOLA for now. We began our turn direct JAMBA.MIA Departure Control; very busy; asked 'are you proceeding direct JAMBA?'FO responded; 'yes we are now proceeding direct JAMBA; we've been deviating a little to get out of wake turbulence from heavy aircraft we are following.'Departure Control cleared us continue climb 7;000 ft. speed restriction 250 kts.Just before reaching JAMBA Departure Control cleared us direct to KBOLA.4 NM before KBOLA Departure Control gave us a heading and 250 speed restriction still in effect; after which the remainder of the flight continued uneventfully.[We discussed; as a crew;] how and when we; the FO and me; dumped the SID out of the FMC. At the gate; before push back; with due diligence downloaded our route; departure Runway 8R; SID-KMIA FOLZZ1 FOLZZ; and ATC route clearance amendments FOLZZ DIR ZFP DIR BAAGR DIR GRATX then as filed; manually into the FMC. We then reviewed route and points individually as per normal procedures; all good. On the ATC clearance uplink the amended points came up as FOLZZ-N2617.3W07920.9; ZFP-N2633.3W07841.8; BAAGR-N2649.0W07631.3. When input manually to the FMC for example ZFP you get two choices of Lat Long's to choose from; so you pick the one with the corresponding Lat Long's....etc.                                                                 However; it was noted later at the gate that we could have just auto uploaded the ATC amended part of the clearance through the FMC ATC clearance LOAD button which would have put in the ZFP and BAAGR points with the correct Lat Long's less chance of error....'See-Check it out!' I obviously must have pushed that button. No excuse; as I've read many reports from other professional pilots-colleagues on our team sharing similar events. I respect and thank them for sharing so I wouldn't make this mistake. Some of our pilots; new to aircraft and/or don't fly much; great to review things but; there is the right time and place. My timing was bad to review any FMC operations. I should have checked to see; after my FMC review with the FO; that I hadn't messed up our original route data.
1934879,Captain (CA) was Pilot Flying (PF). We flew ZZZ1 XX with no issue and landed. Taxied off XX onto Runway YY. Ground told us to take Kilo and hold short abeam gate 33. After I read this back I began my after landing flow. I noticed the L BTMS [Brake Temperature Monitor system] Indicator on the most left wheel began to skyrocket. It went from 2 to 15 to 20 and then red. It gave us Master Warning Brake Overheat. ATC cleared us to taxi to the gate; but we told them we need to stay put and run a checklist. I ran Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) then Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). The Captain directed me to call ATC and ask for the fire trucks to take a look at the brakes; as we had no other abnormal indications (the BTMS directly next to it was reading only 02 and green). An airline taxiing by told us they did not see any smoke or fire; and the fire trucks relayed the same information when they arrived. They also took the temperature of the brakes. We elected to continue to the gate. Maintenance deferred the indicator.
1877088,At cruise; (approx 1 hour from landing) ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) F/CTL ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer) PITCH FAULT 2. Shortly followed by F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1. INOP systems - Autopilot 1 and 2; Alternate law - loss of protections - Cat 2 - ELAC Pitch. Ran all ECAMS; checklists; QRH; supplemental QRH. No reset option. [Requested priority handling] out of abundance of caution. Requested priority from ATC for descent and approach - long final on long runway. Advised Dispatch; flight attendants; and passengers. Landed on long runway per procedures (direct law - flaps 3) Landing uneventful - taxied to gate. ATC was very cooperative. Notified Dispatch in the air and after gate arrival.Aircraft had previous write ups for same/similar issue. Aircraft had been in ZZZ for 48 hours prior to this flight for same write up. (ECAM F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1 and 2) and there was a previous write up for ECAM F/CTL ELAC PITCH TRIM FAULT 2.
1910586,The aircraft had the flaps operating only in the flaps primary mode. When the flaps were being operated from 0 to 5 or 5 to up they were operating in the primary mode; and they take forever to retract and at heavy weight; like our takeoff there is a very narrow speed envelope of 10 kts. So we had a heavy takeoff from Runway XX with thunderstorms around the airport and near our SID. Shortly after takeoff while retracting flaps from 1 to up and starting a climbing turn we experienced a windshear of 20 kts loss and momentary stick shaker. I immediately commanded I have control and commanded level attitude and bank and regained airspeed. Afterwards flight proceeded normally. After landing in ZZZ1 spoke to mechanics that flaps as they were; presently; were taking too long to retract in primary mode versus normal operation and did not feel comfortable in this situation especially at heavy weights.
1868126,After clearing the Runway 36L at AUS on Taxiway G; Ground Control issued us taxi instructions:  'G; C; West Ramp on C.  The First Officer then went off frequency to call Operations. Just before reaching taxiway C; I looked to my left in the direction of the upcoming turn and saw a Aircraft Y; moving southbound on C at about 30-40 knots. I had to slam on my brakes in order to avoid a collision. I then made a snarky remark to the Ground Controller that a head's up about Aircraft Y jet would have been appreciated. He apologized and said something to us to indicate that he had been distracted by ramp traffic and airplanes waiting to get to gates. This could have been a catastrophic collision had I not been glancing to my left.  Recommend a dedicated ramp controller that deals with ramp traffic thereby allowing the Ground Controller to monitor and control the movement area.Ground Control distracted with ramp congestion and never told us about other aircraft.Suggest a dedicated Ramp Control frequency and Controller.
1876910,On approach into ZZZ around 5;000 feet MSL; we began selecting flaps. The flaps began to extend but froze at about 0.5 degrees extension.We told ZZZ Approach that we needed to cancel the approach. ZZZ Approach vectored us north on downwind so we could run the appropriate QRH.We determined the correct QRH in this situation to be: Trailing Edge Flap Disagree - The trailing edge flaps are not in the commanded (flap handle) position. There was no asymmetry. We completed the QRH; landed; and taxied to the gate uneventfully.We are awaiting the cause for the flap extension failure from the maintenance investigation. Practicing flap malfunctions in CQ (Continuing Qualification) definitely helped with the flap failure on this flight. Also it's been great practicing early missed approaches in CQ the past 2 years as I got to apply that training on this flight!
1896349,While I was Pilot Monitoring (PM) during our stabilized approach to XXL at ZZZ; we encountered strong crosswinds within demonstrated limits.  The First Officer was Pilot Flying (PF) and reported at least 930 hours in type and at the operation.  After autopilot disconnection at approximately 300 ft. Above Ground Level (AGL); the PF started to enter into a pilot induced oscillation (PIO) with their airspeed; but was within stabilized approach criteria.  I called for a speed correction which in turn required other flight control changes given the pitch power relationship.  We touched down on centerline; but the PF did not initially introduce enough aileron correction for the crosswind.  After prompting the PF to introduce more right aileron; the airplane started to drift to the left to a point where I did not witness the PF making enough of a correction with the rudder to maintain centerline as well.  At this point; the nose landing gear had not yet touched the ground.  During this point in time; I felt a split-second decision needed to be made in the interest of safety and sternly/loudly stated 'my aircraft' and took the airplane from the FO (First Officer).  I initiated a go around and corrected the control issue with regards to the vertical axis.  We went around and advised ZZZ Tower followed by ZZZ Approach that we went around for an approach/landing that became destabilized.  I flew the aircraft back around for a landing on XXL.  We landed without incident and taxied back to the gate.  I then spent at least 10 minutes debriefing heavily with the FO as to why I took the aircraft and explained to them what had occurred and why.  The FO's attitude was positive and he held a tremendous amount of remorse for the occurrence and showed improvement throughout the remainder of the pairing.  Counsel/guidance from the on-call Chief Pilot was also sought.As a Captain I've noticed that there's been a tremendous uptick in issues similar to the instance above.  FO's have been increasingly challenged to the point that they don't seem to trust their hand flying skills.  They seem to have an over reliance on the autopilot.  During the debrief; I explained to my FO that if we would have disconnected the autopilot sooner and would have held heightened awareness for the environmental conditions present during our approach.  We also discussed in the debrief how the aircraft's weight was light.  We had already discussed this concept in flight as well and it was a review at that point in time.  I would humbly suggest that Initial course training capture increased practice/training in strong crosswind conditions with variable aircraft landing weight(s).
1927971,While at cruise at FL450; the crew heard a 'woosh' sound accompanied with a CAS msg ACM O'TEMP and EMER PRESS msgs. Checklists accomplished. I determined that; while not on the checklist; to do an immediate descent as to get to breathable atmosphere as soon as possible in case of a possible cascading failure. We were eventually cleared to 15;000 ft. We removed our masks; and told ATC we were no longer an priority aircraft and expect a normal landing. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) was not requestedSuggestions - Again; while not on the checklist; I was very concerned with a total failure of the pressurization system not to mention the heat from raw bleed air dumping into the cabin. As we were close to several suitable airports I chose to exercise my discretion under 91.3 and [request priority handling] resulting in a controlled but rapid descent. We did not descend to any altitude that we were not cleared for; and as far as I know there were no close calls with other aircraft.
1923087,While maneuvering to avoid heavy precipitation on final to Runway 32 at SRQ; the Pilot Flying (FO (First Officer)) descended below the Normal glide path on base leg. The ILS glide path guidance was erroneous. We descended to approximately 1000 ft. of base leg. Tower issued a low altitude alert. We had already leveled off and were turning to final. Also; there was a significant wind gust that cause the airspeed to gain 20 kts. FO did a nice job correcting and we were stable before reaching 500 ft.
1886403,I was asked to voluntarily submit a report with details for safety purposes; no proposed violation was involved.  I've been flying for XX+ years with YY years active and reserve instructing/evaluating in military trainers.  I'm somewhat of an expert at judging these distances and speeds.  I changed the altitude in the FMS (earlier) at ZZZZZ to a hard 10;000 MSL from a range of 10;000-11;000 MSL as is typical for me.  I was clearing both outside and inside to the PFD/ND to ensure compliance at ZZZZZ.  At ZZZZZ +/- 0.5 miles (most likely at; or after); I noticed a red and white aircraft approximately 800 ft ahead; centered vertically in the Captains windscreen and 2/3 of the way across his windscreen towards the center divider.  I was at a right 8-9 aspect angle (based on his aircraft) with an approximate 70 left heading crossing angle.  His aircraft had near zero motion in the windscreen.  In short I was flying up his 3-9 line; co-altitude with a 416 ft per second closure rate.  Slightly faster if one considers TAS.  Subtract from that closure rate the velocity they had in the same direction (near zero).  I instinctively knew I would collide if I tried to turn right; or left.  I most likely would have collided if I tried to climb over; but certainly would have sent him into an unusual attitude due to my wake/thrust turbulence.  My only choice was to click off the autopilot; rip the throttles to idle and bunt under.  I used enough force to miss the target; but with the secondary consideration of flight attendant and passenger safety.  I would estimate this was a negative 0.25 to positive 0.25 G pushover.  As I passed directly underneath; I became a little concerned that my tail might hit the aircraft.  In short I had 2 to no more than 3 seconds to identify the threat and react appropriately.  I could easily read the tail number across his fuselage; but wasn't concerned with that.  At no time was there and RA; TA; or Proximity displayed on the TCAS.  They apparently either didn't have the transponder; or have it turned on.  ATCC did not have any reading; or skin paint of their aircraft on radar; so no warning was issued.Considering the size of the other aircraft; closure rate; and being nearly motionless in the windscreen; there was little room for any improved clearing technique on my behalf.  A TCAS reading would have avoided the whole scenario.Suggest - Require transponder usage for all aircraft near Class B airspace; or their associated STARS and Departures.
1930450,Aircraft did a gate return to remove a lithium battery per OPS. Team Lead met aircraft; Main Cabin Door was not open. A power bank was given by the Captain to the Team Lead through the window and it was NOT in a Thermal Containment Bag. Team Lead placed item with other [similar items]. All items were taken down to Baggage Service Office at the end of the night. Crew filed a report but did not follow proper procedures. Customer Service Supervisor found out the next day it was smoking item after receiving email from Corporate DG. Customer Service Supervisor never saw item and pictures were not taken.
1915614,Aircraft X check on frequency at FL390 requesting FL350. I told him I have his request. I called for control. I couldn't descend to FL350 yet because of traffic at FL370 within 3-4 miles. Aircraft X said he needs to descend now so I turn him; assign him FL380; and call the ZZZ1 traffic for him. He tells me he's looking for the traffic and reads back descending to FL380. I see his data block update to FL377 and ask him about his descent. He tells me he can't maintain the altitude and is going to FL350. I turn him again but lose separation with the other traffic. I had about 4.5 miles going through the altitude of FL370. I ask what the problem is; and he says he's having a pressurization issue but that FL350 should be fine for now. But soon after requests to go lower and eventually we [gave him priority handling]. Just better communication. He said he would like to descend now but did not tell me the reason. If I knew there was an issue I could have given more urgency to vector and descend. I understand it's a possible situation and a pilot is worried about flying his aircraft first. Maybe I could have prevented the separation loss.
1916861,After parking on spot 1 and when we were in the midst of our shut down flows; the parking brake released. I had my feet on the brakes on the rudder pedals; but apparently not enough as the aircraft rolled a couple of inches. In fact; when it happened; I thought to myself; 'Good thing I have my feet on the brakes.'; and wasn't aware we had rolled at all until my First Officer asked; 'Are we rolling?' By the time she asked; the aircraft had stopped and she noticed her brakes were ineffective as my feet were still holding pressure on the brakes.
1877169,I was in flight heading back towards the airport when I smelled smoke. I called the Tower [and] received an arrival then turned off my main power and checked all of my breakers and fuses. No breakers or fuses were popped so I turned the power back on to identify the issue. Smoke started rolling up from the floor in the center near the panel. I called the Tower told them that I had an electrical fire and that I would be turning off the power. I landed like normal without incident on my landing pad with no further incident.
1870567,Cockpit GPS equipment did not link properly causing a slight deviation from course. Problem was corrected with no further problems.
1898704,Aircraft had history for slow starting since it was new; Our organization troubleshot per the aircraft and engine manufacturer's recommendations (Note: aircraft is under warranty) which ultimately led to removing original engine which was sent to the engine Mfg for evaluation and installing a rental engine provided by the engine mfg. Ground testing revealed loaner engine met all parameters for takeoff power and aircraft was released to service. Aircraft was returned to owner by a company professional pilot whom stated the aircraft flew normal and reported no anomalies. A while later the owner contacted us and said the aircraft flies slower than the published cruise numbers and later brought the aircraft back to us for a scheduled annual inspection at which time we performed performance runs and noted no power issues on the ground. We did recalibrate the auto throttle system thinking that may have been a factor but later the customer reported that it still was flying slower than published. On DATE we were notified by Name (A/C Mfg) and Name 2 and Name 3 (Eng MFG) that we had installed the wrong build spec engine on the aircraft even though it was the correct model engine which was the cause for it to fly slower. There is no mention of a certain build spec for installation in either the aircraft Type certificate or engine certificate nor is there any mention of it in any of the maintenance publications. The rental engine was reserved and provided by Name 2 and 3(Eng MFG). Our team received an email on DATE1 that rental engine S/N XXXXA had been reserved. The rental engine arrived to our facility on DATE2. We waited to open shipping crate until we received approval from Name 2 and 3 (Eng Mfg.); which was granted on DATE3. On DATE4 at XA:27CST Name 2 and 3 (Eng Mfg) provided email containing cert package for rental engine S/N XXXXA. On DATE4 at XB:43CST we received an email 'Please disregard my previous cert package. I have attached the correct one...'. The updated cert package was for rental engine S/N XXXXB. The original rental engine S/N XXXXB was the correct build spec for the aircraft. The rental engine S/N XXXXA that Name 2 and 3 (Eng Mfg.) had actually shipped was not the correct build spec; and as expressed earlier there is no guidance on any build spec requirements to install PT6A-66D.
1915728,"I arrived at the gate at XX03Z because my [App] was crashing in Operations as I was unable to download my signed off release. I had to close the app out twice to finally have the signed flight plan downloaded. Upon arrival at the jet; I noticed a plan DG summary for aircraft batteries. I saw nothing about a human organ shipment as it stated on my [Flight] Release that we were a Medevac flight and ATC has been notified. I contacted Dispatch prior to arriving at the airport to see what we were carrying as a Medevac flight. It was a kidney. I believe it was about XX30Z; planned departure was XX40Z; that Ramp contacted me to say they were ready for brake release. I did receive the final DG summary for aircraft batteries; but nothing about the human organ shipment; so I asked them if they loaded a human organ shipment. They were not sure and that he will contact his Supervisor. At that time; I sent an ACARS message to load planning; with no response back on ACARS. We are now past scheduled departure time by 1 minute. I called Dispatch and he connected us to load planning who told us that a 'quickpack' of 4 lbs. was loaded in the aft cargo. Ramp verified that with me as well. All checklists were completed. We proceeded to push back per SOPs. My recommendation to this would be actual confirmation to the PIC (Pilot in Command) that shipment has been boarded when declared a Medevac flight.At XX48Z; (past scheduled departure) brakes were released; and command given to push to Spot XX using SOP push procedures. It seemed to me they pushed us to the Spot XY line; centering on that line and then proceeded to the XX line. They told me to set brakes when the aircraft was not on the XX line; but angled and pointed towards the XX Spot. I told them no; and to have the aircraft centered on the XX line and that there was an aircraft on XX Taxiway inbound for [Taxiway] XY who was going to be using the XC lane"". They proceeded to attempt to center the aircraft on the taxilane; but we really never got on it. I suggested to them to pushback deep into the alleyway; but they started to and at the same time; the inbound aircraft was just abeam [Taxiway] XY and stopped as they saw our Ground Crew struggling. They started to turn our aircraft to the right and forward to get with the other aircraft abeam the gate. Our left Wingwalker remained at the nose of the aircraft and never returned to the left side. I told them to stop as I was worried that they were going to pull forward and not have the clearance with the other aircraft's tail without the Wingwalker. Another Ground Crew arrived at [Taxiway] XY to marshall in the inbound. Our crew pulled us up abeam XY; not centered on the line and told me to set brakes. I set the brakes as there was no safety concern at this point. The Tug Operator asked to disconnect. I said disconnect. I saw the tug and all wing walkers leave the area. We proceeded to start the #2 engine. Ran the after start checklist; contacted Ground Control and proceeded to complete the flight uneventfully. My mistake in this episode was forgetting to have them clear me for engine start before disconnecting."""
1870030,ADSB/GPS Outage in the Denver Metro area. At around XA:00Z D01 notified ZZZ1 that there are GPS (to include ADSB) anomalies within 50 miles of Denver. We immediately started broadcasting this on the ATIS. As traffic has picked up today (still relatively slow for ZZZ1); we've had numerous reports of aircraft losing ADSB; and numerous reports of aircraft losing GPS. We also lost all ADSB on our side for approximately an hour. This is problematic for our operation. Since the implementation of ADSB; we have had many controllers train and certify using this feature. I am currently the only controller on shift that certified prior to ADSB. If our traffic was moderate it would be a safety concern; especially during a VFR pop up arrival rush. As for the GPS outages; most of the aircraft reported losing their GPS on finals from as far out as 15 miles to within 1 mile final. Luckily today is VFR. However; this time of year through April are our heaviest precipitation months.  Often strong frontal patterns move in quickly; with last minute changes in forecast. We provide service for pilots with little experience; and though today is VFR; many general aviation aircraft have returned to base due to GPS outages. We have logged aircraft reporting issues in our facility log. We currently have 11 reports. There are many that have inquired about outages; but did not report an outage themselves. We are not seeing all aircraft ADSB on our side. When we lose their ADSB in the pattern; we are full stopping them to keep the operation safe. We also have the concern for the aircraft that are losing their ADSB while flying under the Bravo airspace. I am simply passing along safety information. I have heard of a 'solar storm' and I am aware of the 5G implementation. I will not speculate on the cause of the outages today. I am hopeful you can find out what happened and fix it.
1927506,Busy VFR day at WVI; landing and departing Runway 20; uncontrolled. I was acting as a Safety Pilot for a friend for some practice approaches. We were lining up to Runway 20 after a departure with knowledge of an Aircraft Z on a left base. We delayed our takeoff roll; announced a left crosswind departure and Aircraft Z ended up announcing a go-around due to us being on the runway. As we rotated about 50 ft. above the ground; Aircraft Z overflew us by about 50 ft. then made a left turn. Out of reaction; we adjusted our pitch up and it was particularly dangerous in that critical climbout phase with gear/flaps in the transition to be pulled up; thus lost of lift. Although we had right of way in that situation; it was a better decision to reject the takeoff or announce a delayed takeoff. Aircraft Z should've went around with a slight offset to the right. Complacency and the inaction on our part to efficiently use the runway; but there's a slight chance the Aircraft Z was flying fast in.On the return leg we were entering a 45 for a left downwind 20. Aircraft Y was inbound over the city of Gilroy on a straight in to 20. It was an easy decision but we followed them in without a factor; but it required a lot of coordination over the radio of who was following who when Aircraft Y should've flown the standard pattern entry to follow us in.
1879331,Night arrival on the JANNY 5. Outbound after WABBT and level at 5000 ft. MSL as assigned by ATC; received 'Whoop; Whoop; Pull Up' advisory from EGPWS (Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System). As Pilot Flying; initiated response by disconnecting the autopilot; maximum thrust; while pitching nose up while maintaining assigned heading. Advisory quickly went away and leveled at 5200 ft. MSL; notifying ATC. Descended back to 5000 FT and re-engaged the autopilot. No aircraft conflict during maneuver. Noticed [a] hill underneath the aircraft prior to EGPWS activation; but did not present itself as a threat visually. Also noted 'RA' on the MFD (Multi-function Flight Display) presented with terrain pop up during advisory.Wonder if the radio altimeter had malfunctioned due to 5G interference. As mentioned earlier; 'RA' flashed on the MFD with terrain pop up; and the Radio Altimeter varied prior to advisory. Though it was dark; the terrain did not visually present itself as a threat as I was looking outside throughout; and 5000 ft. is a normal vectoring altitude for ATC in that area. The only other possible cause would be closure rate with the terrain; we were flying at about 230 kts. due to traffic behind us. No real suggestion; except to see if 5G interference can trigger spurious EGPWS advisories.
1883714,Upon arriving at the aircraft; the Captain and myself reviewed the logbook. Upon review; we found a previously written up ELAC fault; and a failure of an elevator servojack. Both of these write ups had been cleared. We noted that the write up of the elevator servojack indicated that the aircraft had reverted into Alternate Law. During our cockpit preparations; a Flight Control Class II message appeared; was written up; and placed on MEL.While en route; during the course of my normal instrument scan; I noticed that an ECAM had appeared for F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; indicating a fault of the Yellow elevator servojack. I should note that the aircraft did not provide any auditory warnings that this ECAM had occurred; leading us to believe that the FWC (Flight Warning Computer) may have failed also.We performed the ECAM actions and reviewed the QRH. This caused us to discuss the fact that this ECAM had been previously written up. We cleared the ECAM item; and shortly thereafter; we saw another ECAM appear.This was the same ECAM of F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; but now the Green elevator servojack was implicated by the fault. As such; we had now lost half the servojacks on the elevator.At this point; we discussed among ourselves the possibility of the aircraft reverting into alternate law; as this had happened to a previous crew in the previous 2 days. As such; we reviewed the alternate law QRH; and setup the aircraft to land flaps 3 in case we experienced a reversion into alternate law later in the flight. We reviewed the landing distance requirements; and after discussing the issue with Maintenance Control and Dispatch via SATCOM; determined we had the requisite landing distance to continue to ZZZ.No further failures occurred; and we landed without incident. Upon arrival; the Captain wrote up both the servojack failures and the FWC not provided any auditory indications of an ECAM.We briefly discussed the failures with a mechanic; and the crew that was taking over the aircraft.At this point; we proceeded to our next aircraft in order to continue our trip. While we were pushing back; we realized that the aircraft we had written up was also pushing back. This leads me to believe the failed system were simply reset and the aircraft returned to service without troubleshooting.
1909382,I landed Runway XX in ZZZ during VMC conditions and exited the runway on A4. At that point; contacted ground and received clearance to taxi to parking (foxtrot) via alpha; cross XX. My student and I were taxing on alpha and wanted to double check to make sure we were cleared to cross Runway XX. Ground then confirmed we were cleared to cross Runway XX. We continued to taxi. As we approached Runway XX; my student and I proceeded to visually check Runway XX for traffic as a precaution. To the right; we saw an aircraft taking off Runway XX. Had we not held short of Runway XX at that time or checked late; there could have been a collision on the runway. Thankfully we held short. At that point I called tower and stated we were holding short of Runway XX for the plane that just took off. Tower then cleared us to cross XX for the 3rd time and apologized.
1904187,Horizontal stab trim quit working. On final at 1500 ft. AGL with the autopilot disconnected; it was discovered that the stabilizer was stuck at 8 degrees ANU (Airplane Nose Up). No associated Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) message. Control wheel stopper working on either side or the manual levers would operate the stab trim. Elected to continue the approach as the aircraft was fully configured and remained stable with some forward yoke pressure. Landed normally.
1904477,After returning from a routine training flight; my student and I were established in the downwind. While clearing base; I noticed oncoming traffic for what appeared to be an extended final Runway 10; same runway we were landing. I established radio communications with the other aircraft at this point; they previously made no radio calls. He reported having me in sight only after I inquired. After resolving the issue and assuring proper separation; my aircraft turned base from an extended downwind. At this time; the other pilot made a descending left turn from 1800 ft. to a high base; all 1/2 mile west of the approach end of Runway 10. He was again pointing toward me as I was now on final. I repeatedly informed the aircraft of our intent to land and back taxi; as our parallel taxiway is closed per NOTAM. My student landed while I monitored ADS-B In on my EFB. This was our most valuable tool and gave increased SA (Situational Awareness) which resolved what could have been several collision hazards in the pattern before they even became an issue. While on short final; I again called CTAF explaining my intent to land and back taxi. My EFB showed him 300 ft. above me and 1/4 mile behind at this point. Expecting him to go around; I did not execute a go around as I was lower in the pattern and on short final. After landing and turning to back taxi; I saw the offending aircraft sitting on the Runway 10 numbers. He had landed seconds after me; behind me by about 800 ft.; on an active runway. Radio comms directed to his specific tail number increased SA and prevented any collisions. But his omission of radio calls; SA; non-standard pattern use; and dangerous ADM caused a runway incursion.
1921586,On Date; at about XA45 Pacific daylight time; I checked in with ZZZ Center for VFR flight following to my planned destination airport; ZZZ1. I was at my cruise altitude of 10;500 feet MSL. At approximately XA54 there was a loud bang from my engine and I immediately lost power; although the engine was still running roughly. I had smoke coming into the cockpit which smelled like hot engine oil. I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center and explained my situation. They asked how many souls were on board and how much fuel I had. I advised that [a passenger] and I were the only people on board and that we had just refueled at ZZZ2. Center asked what my intentions were and I stated that we were going to try and make it to ZZZ. ZZZ Center advised me to switch to ZZZ Field Tower frequency; which I did. I contacted ZZZ Tower and advised them of our situation and our intention to make it to their field. At about XB01 hours the engine stopped and I shut off the fuel and the magnetos. I advised ZZZ Tower that the engine had stopped and that I had shut off the fuel and magnetos. I was able to make an uneventful; gliding landing; at ZZZ Field at approximately XB05 hours and coasted off of the Runway onto Taxiway 1. My [passenger] and I got out of our airplane and looked under the cowling and noticed internal pieces of our engine sitting on top of the exterior of the engine. There were no injuries and there was no other damage to the aircraft other than the ruptured engine.
1912781,Original aircraft before swap had a mechanical failure with the horizontal stabilizer trim. The FO (First Officer) went to set trim but electric switch failed to operate as it had at gate. Captain side failed too. Trim wheel was stuck and unmovable in the manual mode. After return to gate mechanics confirm electric motor ceased and bonded the trim system. Concern is that if this happened in flight there would be no operable stabilizer trim and could make flight difficult or hazardous. So far unknown as to why manual trim became unavailable with electric motor inoperable.
1887920,At least 20 miles southwest of ZZZ; I checked the airport information on Foreflight and checked for NOTAMs and found none. I made my first radio call on UNICOM; 8 miles southwest of ZZZ with intention of doing a touch and go on the only Runway. I heard a gyrocopter call departing the pattern to the north. I made my next radio call 3 miles southwest; intending to fly northbound on the west side of the airport well outside the pattern; then make a 270 degree turn to enter the left traffic pattern on a 45 degree leg.I then heard another fixed wing aircraft report 6 miles west of the airport. I decided to abandon my initial plan and made a call to inform her that I would be entering the pattern on base leg to avoid any conflict with her. She (the fixed wing) acknowledged. I entered the pattern on a 1.5 mile base leg and then turned final and made a radio call on final. Approx 1/2 mile from the threshold; my partner pointed out a gyrocopter on left base cutting in front of us; about 200 feet above and to our left; turning a tight left base to final.It was a white; open cockpit gyrocopter. Our closest separation was approx 200 feet. I was at the lower altitude momentarily on final. I took evasive action by side-stepping right to the upwind leg to keep the gyro in sight as it landed. I performed a go-around on the upwind leg and exited the pattern straight out to the north. I heard radio traffic from the ground 'hey you just cut in front of that fixed wing' but no acknowledgment from the gyro pilot. We noticed that the airport grounds had a large number of trailers; maybe campers; and surmised they may be having a gyrocopter rally. I asked them on the radio if they had filed a NOTAM and they said yes; but the event doesn't start until tomorrow. On Date I checked the FAA NOTAM website and found none for the event. I called FSS and asked about NOTAMs for ZZZ and they had none. I asked how to file a near mid-air collision report. They said they could not take a report because gyrocopters are certificated aircraft and are not required to file a NOTAM for gatherings.They declined to take a near mid-air report. Seems to me they are making a judgment before even hearing the facts. I am filing this report because I think a NOTAM should be required for gatherings where a large number of NORDO aircraft might be present. I am also filing this report because the gyro pilots may try to find fault with me for not flying a full traffic pattern. I took the action I did (not flying a downwind) because 1) I heard no other aircraft on the radio in the pattern and 2) I wanted to avoid conflict and maintain spacing before the other fixed wing aircraft approaching the pattern - she acknowledged me and said I was in sight and she was number two.
1924202,While taxiing on Taxiway XX to Gate XX; ground had us hold short abeam our gate for an unknown reason. While we were stopped a Cessna was taking off Runway XXL and turned to a heading; passing directly over our aircraft at approximately 100 ft. above the ground.Pilot of the Cessna made a poor decision and turned too early.Have the FAA or Tower follow up with the Cessna Pilot for clarification on why he turned early.
1915470,I was working a 2 Service on Aircraft X. A task card has me checking emergency lights. I noticed an emergency escape path lite inoperative at mid lav and documented it. The fix was the next shift found the wires capped and stowed so I do not know how long this went on being inoperative. I also made a separate report stating the emergency light assembly was not installed at door 1L with panlam covering the area where it should be. The wiring at that location was also capped and stowed.
1934669,This report is filed to bring attention to the highest levels. I have used LAX as a baseline but my concern is not inclusive of LAX as every airport facility using the new LED lights to illuminate the ramp areas is culpable. The LED lights recently installed at LAX; PDX; SEA; and many other airport facilities are too bright. When I taxi in from relatively dark taxiways and am subjected to bright white lights shining directly into my eyes it causes a temporary loss of full visual functionality. To the point that it is difficult to retain focus on the marshaler and the lit wands during the most critical phase of taxi; pulling up to the jet bridge and terminal building. Please consider reverting to amber; or other; colored LED lights instead of white LED lights as they are less impactful on nighttime visual acuity of the human eye. Additionally; please consider any other mitigation factors available from an engineering/design perspective (i.e. changing the height; angle; or position of the lights) that might enhance the safety of flight operations at night.
1884693,At FL390 the autopilot did an uncommanded disengagement and we received a sel elev feel man (Select Elevator Fell to Manual) Level 2 alert on EAD (Engine and Aircraft Display). The aircraft became more difficult to control. The aircraft began to decelerate. We avoided a stall using the AOA reference. We completed the QRH for the sel elev feel man Level 2 alert and discovered the First Officer side airspeed indicator unreliable. We then completed the QRH for Airspeed Unreliable. We requested [priority handling] and landed uneventfully at ZZZ.After the event; I was very thankful for the training I received on unreliable airspeed events. I feel that the sim training helped us identify the unreliable airspeed problem more quickly; which is something that is not immediately obvious to a flight crew. I really feel that the simulator training contributed to the positive outcome of this event.
1920483,RPLC Ramp [erroneously] loaded ADG (Air Carrier Dangerous Goods container) in position 7R inso '[instead of] on a Hazmat pallet where it was accessible. RPLC Ramp loaded flammable liquid in a regular container and loaded in the back of the aircraft and departed. Once airborne the mistake was caught and they contacted me and I advised the crew via ACARS; the Supervisor and ZZZ Operations Control and Maintenance. Not sure if there was a language barrier since it was from RPLC to ZZZZ and it appeared some of the labels may have been in English?
1928036,We received a Gear Disagree Warning after raising the gear. I called for the Gear Disagree QRH checklist. I advised ATC we were returning and received vectors for the approach right away. The First Officer was doing the checklist; after takeoff checklist. By now there was a HYD LO PRESS Caution for SYS 3. We were joining the final for ILS XX with a gear down and 3 green indication and all primary and secondary; FLT Controls working normally. I elected to land because of this. I had advised ATC of a HYD issue . They declared [priority handling] themselves. The landing was fine with loss of braking and nose wheel steering. I was able to clear the runway and stop on the taxiway. We asked for a tow to the gate from there. We were airborne for 10 minutes. We advised the Flight Attendants we were returning. There was no time to message dispatch. With more time we certainly would have advised them of the issue. My First Officer did an outstanding job I feel. His non flying pilot duties were done without my input; to accomplish this as quickly as it occurred.
1934007,"Set up for RNAV arrival into DEN Runway 17R. Briefed contingencies if given the visual approach. When visual approach was given; I extended JNKBX; as previously briefed. We were to treat established inbound on this extension as on the approach."" As we were established on this segment; the PF (Pilot Flying) called to set touchdown elevation; which I did. I then went heads down and looked up the Tower frequency and entered the Tower frequency into the radio number 1 standby window. At this point; I looked outside and then cross checked the instruments and saw we were descending through 6;500 ft. I said; ""Why are we so low?"" and told the F/O (First Officer) (PF) to climb to 7;000 [ft]. At this point; the Approach Controller called with an altitude warning. I replied that were were climbing to 7;000 and we resumed visually the rest of the way to touchdown without incident. The PF had selected LEVEL CHANGE without announcing it (and followed the flight directors blindly) and left the protections of VNAV. A lengthy debrief followed on the proper sequence of events; the protections provided and discarded by his actions and the reasons for following the established SOP."""
1877481,Departure deviation following heavy Widebody after takeoff.[Runway] 8R cleared for takeoff behind heavy Widebody aircraft.Weather conditions after takeoff; night VFR winds out of southeast 45 knots at 1400 ft. MSL.From rotation to about 4;500 ft. in and out of wake turbulence from preceding heavy Wide body aircraft. Just climbing through 1;000 feet FO (First Officer) stated 'we've dumped our departure route' out of the box/FMC.  [We responded by] putting in JAMBA; first waypoint on SID; back in box and then KBOLA for now. We began our turn direct JAMBA.MIA Departure Control; very busy; asked 'are you proceeding direct JAMBA?'FO responded; 'yes we are now proceeding direct JAMBA; we've been deviating a little to get out of wake turbulence from heavy aircraft we are following.'Departure Control cleared us continue climb 7;000 ft. speed restriction 250 kts.Just before reaching JAMBA Departure Control cleared us direct to KBOLA.4 NM before KBOLA Departure Control gave us a heading and 250 speed restriction still in effect; after which the remainder of the flight continued uneventfully.[We discussed; as a crew;] how and when we; the FO and me; dumped the SID out of the FMC. At the gate; before push back; with due diligence downloaded our route; departure Runway 8R; SID-KMIA FOLZZ1 FOLZZ; and ATC route clearance amendments FOLZZ DIR ZFP DIR BAAGR DIR GRATX then as filed; manually into the FMC. We then reviewed route and points individually as per normal procedures; all good. On the ATC clearance uplink the amended points came up as FOLZZ-N2617.3W07920.9; ZFP-N2633.3W07841.8; BAAGR-N2649.0W07631.3. When input manually to the FMC for example ZFP you get two choices of Lat Long's to choose from; so you pick the one with the corresponding Lat Long's....etc.                                                                 However; it was noted later at the gate that we could have just auto uploaded the ATC amended part of the clearance through the FMC ATC clearance LOAD button which would have put in the ZFP and BAAGR points with the correct Lat Long's less chance of error....'See-Check it out!' I obviously must have pushed that button. No excuse; as I've read many reports from other professional pilots-colleagues on our team sharing similar events. I respect and thank them for sharing so I wouldn't make this mistake. Some of our pilots; new to aircraft and/or don't fly much; great to review things but; there is the right time and place. My timing was bad to review any FMC operations. I should have checked to see; after my FMC review with the FO; that I hadn't messed up our original route data.
1879112,We received the aircraft from another flight crew who stated the aircraft was 'fine' and only had the Nose Wheel steering switch off set vertically by about 20 degrees. I visually confirmed that the switch was offset vertically; and still moved and functioned appropriately. I asked my First Officer check the nose gear carefully during her walk around. She came back and stated everything was good outside. We continued normal operations.During the initial climb after rotation; I remarked during gear retraction that 'the nose wheel seemed awfully loud' and it successfully retracted with no sensor errors reported on the Flight Deck. The noise ceased on gear retraction. We continued our flight as normal. During approach and landing; the nose gear did not make any noise different than as expected on our day to day operations. Touch down of the main gear was fine; until the nose wheel made contact with the runway.The aircraft began to steer right at about 2-3 degrees a second; which I immediately began applying opposite rudder. When that was not working; I add right only brake to bring the aircraft nose back toward center line. Then the nose started going to the right at 2-3 degrees a second. I swapped inputs to left rudder and brake. Once the aircraft nose started coming back left; I applied strong brake pressure on both mains and slowed down to a speed where I could safely exit the runway. This all happened in the span of 5-10 seconds. As the aircraft slowed down; it was more under control; than at the higher ground speed upon landing.After we taxied to the gate; I had my First Officer do a walk around and asked her to check the nose carefully; as I called Maintenance. When she came back she remarked how the Nose was 'fully extended;' in which the Maintenance Controller remarked that 'the swerving would be attributed to an over extended nose strut.'The next day I spoke with a crew that was ferrying the aircraft out of ZZZ; and explained the entire narrative above. The Captain was very appreciative; since this 'filled in the gaps' for what his ferry flight was for.
1908862,I cleared Aircraft X for the VOR-A Approach into HII.  I cleared the aircraft to cross EED AOA FL059 and then cleared for the approach.  In my opinion it sounded like the pilot read back the correct restriction at EED although the frequencies are terrible at that sector and might have caused it to sound like a correct read back.  The MSAW alert did NOT go off and I happen to notice the aircraft was below the MEA and at FL057.  I issued a low altitude alert and told the aircraft to climb to FL059.  Once I observed the aircraft at a safe altitude (FL060); I recleared the aircraft for the VOR-A approach.  The pilot did seem to be in a training flight which might have also caused this.  We really need to get better radio sites at sector 6.  This has been an issue for several years and multiple reports have been filed with no resolve. Area D has eventually given up on filing reports for the radios since we have been told nothing can be done.  If there was a bad read back then better radios would have certainly prevented this from happening.  There are times when mains/standbys/BUECS (Back Up Emergency Communication System) do not work and the only way to reach a pilot is by aircraft relay.  Aircraft relays are to the point where they have to be used almost every session at this sector.  As a regular occurrence; when we are able to reach pilots it is hard to understand them.
1915468,Performing a #2 service on Aircraft X; found door 2R emergency exit light assembly not installed. Further troubleshooting discovered the area had been panlamed over. Gained access to lower panel of aft galley and found wires dangling. Had to order new lite assembly to install and hook up wiring. Similar to Aircraft Y which had same problem 2 days earlier.
1909407,We had loaded; verified and both checked that the Departure SID was loaded in the FMS and verified against our ATC clearance even before pushback. We again verified the departure SID as part of navigation brief as part of the before T/O checklist. We departed ZZZ on a 160 heading. Shortly thereafter while climbing through approximately 15;000 ft MSL we were cleared direct to the ZZZZZ fix on the Departure. We selected that fix for direct to and executed it in the FMS. We selected LMAV and verified it on the FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator). The aircraft turned and flew to ZZZZZ in a climb while on the autopilot. We were switched from ZZZ1 Departure to ZZZ2 Center enroute to ZZZZZ in climb. After being cleared to climb to FL230 ZZZ2 [Center] asked us to verify what fix we were direct to at that time. We both reviewed the LEGS page immediately and discovered that the FMS had dropped 4 NAV points on the SID after the ZZZZZ fix. The FMS had taken us to ZZZZZ and reverted to heading at some point. The 4 NAV points after ZZZZZ that were dropped were ZZZZZ1; ZZZZZ2; ZZZZZ3 and ZZZZZ4. There was no annunciation that the aircraft had reverted to Heading Mode nor that the NAV points had been dropped from the FMS. Both GPS's appeared normal; there was no traffic conflict reported by ATC. There were no indications of IRS (Inertial Reference System) issues apparent. We were flying near where GPS jamming occurs sometimes but there were no NOTAMS on jamming. We were given a 170 vector for a brief time and then given direct to ZZZ1 on the SID which was still in the FMS as part of the Departure SID. We continued on in our climb and finished flight to ZZZ3. As additional note we discovered that on beginning the Arrival STAR into ZZZ3 that the preloaded altitudes for the NAV point ZZZZZ5 had dropped from the FMS. I had already verified the altitudes at ZZZZZ5 twice as the FO (First Officer) and the Captain had also verified the altitudes loaded in the FMS prior to descent. There was no annunciation of the altitudes for ZZZZZ5 dropping from the FMS. Luckily we found out ahead of the fix. After the flight we alerted maintenance and made a write up in the maintenance logbook. There were no more issues during the flight.
1884167,Taxiing out on Taxiway H to Runway 4 for takeoff; I commented to First Officer that I haven't taken off on [Runway] 4 for over a year. We were cleared to cross 13L and R. Approaching former Runway 17/35; I became confused; because the Runway hold markings were still on the pavement; so I brought the aircraft to a stop and queried ATC; who confirmed the Runway was closed as depicted on the 10/9 chart. An additional Safety concern is all the Gate location signs (the number of the Gates) in HOU are extremely faded and almost impossible to read. Remove or paint over outdated markings on airport pavement. Repaint gate location signs in HOU.
1913156,Arriving to aircraft at ZZZ gate; halfway down the jetway I noticed the 'smelly sock' odor. Once on the aircraft the smell [was] strong. The APU was on with APU bleed air supplying the packs as well the gate ground air being hooked up and supplying ground air. Went outside and turned off the ground air. Once back on the aircraft I noticed the smell became even more pungent. I turned off the APU bleed air and turned off the APU and the flight attendants who were on board exited the aircraft. Once the APU bleed air was off and the APU was shut down the odor began to dissipate. The entire crew exited the aircraft and a logbook entry for the fume event was made in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook.
1880656,I was flying solo; practicing touch and goes in the traffic pattern. On my 5th landing; I was on a left base for Runway XX at ZZZ when I saw a traffic alert on my GPS as well as Fore Flight that stated traffic at same altitude. I visually scanned for traffic outside and saw Aircraft Y flying straight at me. The aircraft ended up climbing and flew 100 ft. above me. I asked what his intentions were on the radio and it was unclear to me what he said. He then asked me what I was doing and another instructor who was in the pattern told him that he had almost hit me. He then proceeded to maneuver west to enter the pattern on a 45; and cut in front of that instructor on their downwind for Runway XX.
1924008,I issued a MEL 21-XX-a and checked the history but it was not clear to me on what flight the MEL previously was closed in ZZZ. So it repeated on the next flight leg and i issued a new MEL but should have re-opened the previous MEL. Unclear in safe on what flight the MEL was cleared in ZZZ on date. System upgrade to avoid issuing a new MELfor an previously closed MEL.
1910941,Aircraft X arrived in ZZZ with a pilot write up for #2 Full authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) ALTN followed Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) procedures and no help. Upon troubleshooting found multiple flight legs showing faults in both EEC2A and EEC2B which would be cause for an OOS (Out of Service) event due to being unable to defer the FADEC. I relayed this information to my Supervisor and was asked to stay late and assist the other mechanics as I was the only qualified; eligible mechanic on the MD-11 that evening. I informed my Supervisor that I had a TDY in the morning and that I had to drive to my TDY location and would not be able to stay. I found that 2 mechanics Person A and Person B were forced to stay and replace a Relay that Maintenance Control believed to be the cause of the issue. I decided that I would stay and assist them with the engine runs as they were unfortunate enough to be forced incorrectly based on the rules which state the least senior mechanics on shift were supposed to be forced.Person A and Person B changed the relay and I performed the Engine Runs on #2; during the runs no faults were noted and after 5 mins I shut down the engine and checked for faults in EEC2A and EEC2B; only EEC2B showed a fault for 2.95 BLD which I informed my Supervisor of and upon him speaking with Maintenance Control we found this was a deferrable issue. During the process of signing the logbook; my Supervisor handed me the MEL required and said he was speaking with Maintenance Control about the deferral. Person A signed off the Replacement of the relay and began documenting the fault and MEL on the following step leaving blank the SOT for the Control Number once the MEL was called in. It was at this moment that my Supervisor informed us that the airplane was being placed OOS for a Possible HYD leak in the tail; this caused myself; Person A and Person B to speak up as to why then be forced to fix an issue that would cause the airplane to go OOS if he was going to put it OOS regardless. After this discussion with my Supervisor we all called fatigue and decided to leave and work the aircraft in the morning since it would be OOS and I would travel on TDY in the morning. During this time and lack of communication I failed to call Maintenance Control to document the MEL procedure and receive a control number for the MEL. After 2 days I received a phone call today; from the ZZZ NDA supervisor advising me that they were trying to impact the paperwork for Aircraft X and were unable to impact the MEL as there was no Control Number for it. I contacted Maintenance Control and explained to them what had happened and that I had dropped the ball by documenting the fault and corrective action but failed to contact them for the deferral; it was at this time that I was informed by Maintenance Control that due to me being on TDY at another gateway; I could not legally document the Deferral for an Aircraft in ZZZ; and it would have to be redone in ZZZ.
1935126,On initial gear extension; 'gear unsafe' light illuminated and did not get any green gear lights to illuminate.  Executed a go-around at approximately 1000 ft. AGL.  Once at a safe altitude and in level flight; referenced the POH and performed the 'Landing gear unsafe' checklist. After performing the checklist; I was faced with a left main gear unsafe indication; right main and nose indicated safe.  I elected to contact ZZZ Approach to perform a fly by with the tower to visually check my left main gear.  They verbally confirmed the left main was down but could not confirm (nor would I expect) that the gear was locked. Having already [requested priority handling]; they suggested I land at ZZZ1.  However; based on Runway XX at ZZZ and the unobstructed grass on the left side of the runway; I elected to land with the left-wing overhanging the grass.  This scenario allowed that if the left main collapsed; the left wing would be in the grass and not potentially rupture the wing tank and create friction of metal on cement.  Fortunately; the gear was down and the landing uneventful.  Due to an unsafe gear indication; I stopped straight ahead and shut down the airplane.  On visual inspection; the gear was not locked but was down; thus a turn to the right may have caused the gear to 'fold' up under the left wing.Although emergency resources were more available at ZZZ1; my decision to go to ZZZ was grounded in the clear (no lights or obstruction) alongside Runway XX/XY.  I maintained my [priority] status with ZZZ Approach until safely on the ground at ZZZ.
1929778,Weather exploded east of ELP; traffic quickly began to overwhelm the controller on Sector X who was working Aircraft X. Frequency congestion was a nightmare; the gigantic sector; the multiple transmitter sites; the planes all calling to deviate; and the bottleneck around ELP; Mexico; White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The Controller was extremely busy; I was listening to him go down the tubes. I started out on the D-side on Sector Y and we were quickly in the same boat as the Controller on Sector X. Sector X Controller realized too late that Aircraft X was deviating north towards [Restricted Area] R-XXXX which was active FL300 and below. After taking the hand off; I realized the same thing; the Sector X Controller gave a hard vector south to a 190 heading and used the term immediately. I saw conflict alert go off with the Aircraft operating in R-XXXX; which we think was a military drone. The TCAS didn't go off on Aircraft X. The Pilot of Aircraft X checked on stating he turned south to miss a drone; not sure if that was an evasive maneuver or from the heading given from the Sector X Controller. We had to go into no notice holding as we got so busy; we couldn't insure separation of aircraft from each other or the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The weather quickly built and traffic quickly overwhelmed the SE specialty. Command Center / Traffic Management Unit (TMU) constantly neglect the complexity of us working traffic through this area. There is a lot of pressure for us to not hold; not lower the map numbers; not route planes north. I would recommend that we have a specific Pro-day for the SE and SW specialties to practice different routes and holding scenarios; and also have upper management encourage us to take this action sooner rather than waiting and trying just 'make it work' or 'just get through this shift'. There is a pernicious attitude that pervades both the SE; management; Traffic Management Unit and ZAB as a whole to never do this; that we change this culture.
1869402,Trigger...at FL380 was given descent to FL340. At approximately FL360; the CAB PRESS status page displayed showing a cabin altitude of 9;500 feet and rising. Action requested priority handling with ZZZ ATC; started rapid descent to 10;000 feet; seat belt sign on. First Officer (FO) and pilot flying; performed a maneuver with the autopilot on. ATC gave us initial descent to FL270 and a frequency change. New Controller gave us descent to 10;000 feet with altimeter setting of 29.80. We were in VFR conditions; minimum safe altitude from charts approximately 5;000 feet. FO was able to descend quickly enough that a CABIN ALTITUDE ECAM did not trigger nor did the oxygen masks deploy in the cabin. I was able to speak with FA1; during the descent. FA1 confirmed that passengers were okay and did not report any injuries but would update us if something changed. I made a PA to passengers about aircraft condition and plan of action. Requested all to remain seated until in ZZZ.After level off and confirming aircraft was safe to continue; removed the aircraft alert from ZZZ ATC; but requested priority handling into ZZZ. Sent ACARS message to Dispatch. Stated our problem; action; current situation and plan. Received acknowledgment and new fuel remaining calculation for Denver at 10;000 feet. Highest cabin altitude was 11;350 feet. No ECAMs showed on the upper display. Outflow valve; inlet and extract vents all showed closed. During level off; safety valve opened when cabin diff pressure at -.5 PSI. Remaining flight was uneventful to a landing at ZZZ; XXR. Taxi to Gate at XX. Met by ZZZ maintenance and ZZZ FO representative.
1924063,I did my normal before take off check list and procedures; including a normal pre flight. I announced my take off; rolled onto the runway and put power in. I did not take off in the expected distance. The airplane appeared to be making less power than usual. I aborted the take off; however with the wet runway there was no way to use full braking action. I could only use brakes to the extent to keep the airplane tracking straight down the runway. Using full brakes would have resulted in going off of the runway to the right or left with great potential of flipping the airplane over. Not being able to use normal braking action; I went off the end of Runway XX and came to a stop shortly after the end of the runway. There is a grassy down slope about 2 to 3 feet deep that we came to a stop in. I am unsure what caused the power loss; the wet surface made it impossible to stop in time.
1878828,Upon arrival to the plane in ZZZ; a couple of the flight attendants and the first officer; informed me that there had been an unpleasant smell like cleaning solution or a dead animal on the plane but that it had dissipated.  I asked if they were sure it was not a electrical or dirty sock smell (indicative of burned oil getting in the packs)  They assured me it was not.  The smell did not reoccur until in the air: Near the top of climb or just after leveling off; we got a SMOKE CREW REST F/D EICAS caution message.  As this EICAS caution does not have an enunciated checklist and there was no evidence of fire or smoke. I contacted the flight attendants and asked that they check the crew rest area and we began the Smoke; Fire or Fumes checklist.  Moments later; the EICAS caution message disappeared.  The flight attendants reported that they briefly smelled something like cleaning solution when they opened the crew rest door but that it dissipated almost immediately.  The first officer and I decided we should consult maintenance control through SATCOMM.  Before we connected with the dispatcher; the EICAS message briefly reappeared and disappeared.  The EICAS warning did not reoccur again after the second time.  After considering all the evidence; maintenance advised us that it would be OK to continue the flight.  We asked the flight attendants to contact us immediately if they smelled; felt; or saw anything indicating smoke or fire.  The cruise portion of the flight continued without incident; but we remained attentive to possible alternates should anything more occur.  Just before the top of descent; we received a call from the flight attendant in the back of the aircraft.  We had just received our descent clearance into ZZZ1 and a runway change from the ILS 12 to the RNAV Z 12 which generated discontinuity in the arrival.  (an anomaly) We both needed to be present to straighten this out; so I informed the flight attendant that I had to go to get the plane on the ground.About one minute after clearing the runway and before starting the APU; we received a call from the back of the aircraft from a flight attendant reporting an electrical smell.  (It was quite confusing as a slight majority of the flight attendants were reporting the smell of cleaning solution and this one thought it smelled like electrical.)In light of that description; we asked ground control to send the fire department to meet us at the gate.  (I didn't anticipate an evacuation; but felt it was imperative to get the passengers off the plane as soon as possible to avoid the inhalation of fumes should they have occurred.  This is why we proceeded to the gate and asked the fire department to meet us at the there.  Thinking that the smell couldn't be coming from the APU as it was not running when the smell was reported after landing nor during climb; we started the APU so that we could shut down the engines and emergency deplane at the gate should it be necessary.The fire department didn't find any evidence of fire inside the passenger compartment; the baggage compartment; the exterior or any other part of the plane.  Maintenance came on board and asked us to shut down the APU as they all agreed that it was burned oil or hydraulic fluid they could smell; the passengers and flight attendants were off the plane at that point; so I instructed the cleaners to leave the plane and we shut down the APU and left the plane to the mechanics.  Unfortunately; after I left the plane; I was informed from the Chief Pilot in ZZZ that one of the flight attendants had complained to her supervisor about how the situation was handled.  We had very little time to deal with both calls from the back of the plane as we were task saturated in both cases and our priority was getting the plane where it needed to be.   Apparently; something was wrong with the airplane which allowed the odor of burned oil or hydraulic fluid to intermittently enter the cabin.  It isn't really possible to determine if an odor is a threat from it's characteristics (how it smells). In the future; if there is a smell on an aircraft; I will follow the Aircraft Odor - Ground checklist (which I didn't realize existed.) and make an entry in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook no matter what the odor smells like.
1888974,I was landing on Runway XX which was being used by the ILS and other airport traffic. AWOS reported wind as variable at 3 KTS. After making a three point touch-town the aircraft began to turn to the right and I corrected with left rudder and left brake inputs. The aircraft continued to the right until the left wing contacted the runway and the airplane 'ground looped' damaging the left wing and aileron. There was no propeller strike and the engine continued to idle until I shut it down.
1926297,During climb through 5500 out of ZZZ to ZZZ1 right engine CGR [engine] monitor and red warning indicator on panel both indicated oil temperature in the red. Oil pressure indicated drop down in the yellow. Initially increased mixture on right engine and reduced power. Observed no change during slow climb. Leveled off and reported to ATC that I needed precautionary return with priority handling to the field due to abnormal engine indications. No change in temp and pressure during vectors back to the field. Elected to pull power back to just above idle to maximize cooling while giving minimal thrust to maintain safe and effective aircraft control. [Advised ATC] upon indications not changing. 4-5 minutes after starting the return the oil temp started to drop back to high normal range. Oil pressure remained low due to power setting. I elected to keep the minimal power setting during the landing.
1912004,We were conducting a series of drone flights in support of a science project at the school. Our position was just outside surface Class C airspace for ZZZ. The intent was to fly directly vertically from the top of our building; hover the drone at a fixed location directly above the building and at altitude of 375 ft above the roof; and measure temperature and humidity for 15-20 minutes before landing; replacing the battery; and launching again. We had successfully completed five uneventful flights over several days; with two of those successful flights occurring earlier today. In all previous flight; the positioning and control of the drone had been rock solid.  On the third flight of the day; the drone was again commanded to ascend to 375 ft above the launch point; and around the time it reached that altitude; it suddenly reported a compass error that I had never seen before; and it yawed an unknown amount from its originally north heading. The student visual observer; who had briefly looked away; reported to me that it was no longer in its expected position directly over us. Shortly thereafter; the drone reported a problem with the GPS lock as well. Neither of us were able to determine visually in which direction the drone had moved; and the video feed from the downward-viewing camera that I had been partly relying on to monitor the drone's position over the building became very poor; with only sporadic updates. Very soon; the occasional video refreshes that we got showed that the drone had; uncommanded; moved well out over the Lake; or at least 0.5 NM away from our position. Because I had lost positional awareness; I did not execute any positioning commands whatsoever except yaw to try bring our building into view of the camera in the hope that I could manually navigate it back home. Before I could do that; the video feed became unusable; and in short order; the control link was lost altogether as well.  Because of the reported GPS problem and because I didn't know why it had flown away; I was also reluctant to send a return-to-home command; because I didn't know whether the drone had reliable position information and whether it would return to the correct starting point.We had not been able to ascertain in exactly which direction it had gone or how far it had gone; but at some point the link was reestablished; and it became apparent that the drone was approaching from the northeast and automatically executing a return-to-home due to the lost link.  We reacquired it visually when it was perhaps half a mile from us; and it then automatically landed again on the building roof without further incident.During the period when it wasn't under positive control; it busted the 400 ft AGL altitude limit; because it was no longer directly over our 150 ft tall building and was probably at around 525 ft relative to the surrounding terrain. And because of the direction from which it returned; we also suspect; but are not yet certain; that it busted the surface Class C airspace that begins just a few city blocks to our northeast.  It's because of these two issues that I'm filing this report.I don't know why we experienced this problem after a number of uneventful flights; but I can't rule out radio frequency interference; especially given the compass error; loss of GPS lock; and poor video feed all occurring at nearly the same time. Our lapse in maintaining continuous visual contact was a contributing factor; because once it moved away from the expected position; we lost all situational awareness and were unable to effectively intervene to manually bring it back to the building.A factor in losing visual contact was that the drone had remained reliably directly above us; stable as a rock; for all previous flights; and it was strenuous to keep looking straight up for long periods of time. There was no better vantage point because of the confines of the roof; and there was never previously any difficulty spotting it again after briefly looking away; which led to complacency.
1913885,Rolling down the runway for takeoff; aircraft stops. After a pause; flight deck over PA; REMAIN SEATED; got out of jumpseat; assessed out Door 1L; while shouted a few times to remain seated. While awaiting Captain Instruction; communication; put FA (Flight Attendant) # 5 to continue to access Door 1L. FA #2 was accessing Door 1R; I went to access OW (Over Wing) exits to access engine; wings. Requested customers to keep an eye and notify if anything unusual. Returned to [Door] 1L.Captain called to communicate the situation of engine malfunction and we would return to gate. No incidents; no injury. Swapped aircraft. Continued our journey to ZZZZ without incident
1894638,While conducting the ILS approach to Runway 31 at DSM I received a low altitude alert from the Approach Controller; was instructed to climb to 2500 ft. I did so; intercepted the glideslope and made a normal landing.I was cleared to and cross CYCLN (IAF) at or above 3000 ft.; cleared for the ILS 31 approach. Hand flying (no AP) I descended to 3000 ft.; flew direct to CYCLN; turned right to join the localizer. I crossed over CYCLN and descended to the next lower altitude of 2400 ft. until FOREM (FAF). At 2400 ft. I was above the broken cloud layer; I had Ground contact at this time; the layer appeared to be thin. My localizer needle bounced full left then right then slightly left indicating I was slightly right of the localizer centerline; while confirming the Garmin 430 non WAAS was in the correct mode (I had previously confirmed this but was taken back by the needle bounce) I simultaneously accidentally pulled my approach plate and airport diagram off the yoke clip (I'm old school and prefer paper as opposed to iPad) spent several seconds looking between my legs for it; finally retrieved it off the floor; started correcting to the left. The Controller issued a 'low altitude alert' and instructed me to climb to 2500 ft. until established on the localizer. At this time; I was at 2000 ft.; I immediately climbed to 2500 ft.; course corrected slightly left; became established on the localizer; intercepted the glide slope; handed off to Tower and made a normal on course stabilized approach; I broke out with good visibility (2-3 miles) just as I passed FOREM around 1200 ft. agl; landed normally.Altitude deviation due to last minute troubleshooting the radio setup and bending down to floor to find lost papers resulted in forward pressure on yoke and resulted in a descent.
1921682,After finishing my preflight inspection; I started the airplane and announced on the radio that I would be taxing to runway XY. Along the way there; there were no other aircraft on frequency making radio calls. Once I arrived at the hold short line for runway XX; I looked for traffic and I did not see any aircraft approaching runway XX. No one had made any radio calls; and there was no traffic shown on [my aircraft's] GPS with ADSB. I then announced that I was crossing runway XX at Taxiway 1. After that; I began crossing the runway and as I was clearing the hold short line on the other side of the runway; my instructor called over the radio telling me not to take off; and that there was an emergency aircraft that would be overflying runway XX to circle to runway XY. Shortly after that; the airplane overflew runway XX. I then taxied over to the runup/hold short area of runway XY at Taxiway 2. From there I saw the emergency aircraft circle back around for landing. When they touched down on the runway; the airplane rolled down the runway for a moment then its right landing gear collapsed causing the right wing and nose to hit the ground. The airplane then started sliding on the ground and slid off the right side of the runway after the intersection. From there; I shut down [my aircraft]; engaged the parking brake; and ran over to the crashed airplane to make sure everyone was ok. One of the employees of the airport had also driven over there as well.After confirming that everyone was alright; I went back to [my aircraft] and got on the radio and called the UNICOM for instructions. I was told to taxi back the way I had come and park the airplane. I then started the plane up; announced that I was taxing back to the ramp; and began taxing. Once I got to the hold short line for runway XX; I checked for traffic and then announced that I was crossing the runway at Taxiway 1. Once I was clear of runway XX; I announced that I was clear and taxing the plane back to the ramp for parking.
1879944,I heard Ground Control tell Aircraft X 'Runway XX left at Taxiway X; Tower for the back-taxi'. I was working Local Control and saw an Aircraft Y on the northwest ramp begin to taxi. I then began to scan the north end of Runway XXL and looked along its length to the south end as I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff. 'Aircraft Y; left turn on course; Runway XX left at Taxiway Y cleared for takeoff; traffic two mile final.' Aircraft Y read back the entire transmission and then began to taxi forward past the hold line. I was then looking further to the south for any other aircraft that I might have missed on a base turn or short final. Seeing none; I turned to the STARS display to see my inbound traffic; check my sequences and see if there were any traffic conflicts. Seeing none; I turned back to the north to scan my runway again. At this point; I see Aircraft X *ON* Runway XXL taxiing southbound at a good rate of speed opposite direction and had just started to slow and turn to exit the runway at Intersection Z.I yelled to Ground Control 'That guy is on my runway!' I then tried to call Aircraft X on my frequencies but got no response. At this point; Aircraft X was crossing the hold line on Taxiway Z off the runway and Aircraft Y was on departure roll. I determined that it would do more harm than good to stop Aircraft Y departure so I let them continue. I tried to call Aircraft X again and he responded saying 'We heard you clear that other guy so we exited the runway here at Taxiway Z.'I told him that Ground Control had wanted them to CONTACT me for back-taxi; not to back-taxi and monitor my frequency. I then instructed Aircraft X to contact Ground Control on frequency again. I'm not sure if Ground Control gave Aircraft X a warning or not. I had other traffic that demanded my attention. If the Ground Controller had used proper/standard phraseology; I believe that Aircraft X would not have crossed the hold line for Runway XXL and would instead have called me on the frequency.
1934190,This is the information about the flight as submitted on the airspace authorization and forwarded to Airport Director/Tower Manager:A radius of 1 NM about the following coordinates at or below 400 ft. AGL: Latitude XX; Longitude YY. The Aviation Division has been tasked by the State's commission to collect video and photographs of the selected site. The Airport Director; Person A; has agreed to operations at or below 400 ft. AGL in the proximity of the above location. The requested five day window is Day 0 - Day 4. This window is to allow for optimal weather. The authorization system rejected submittal for multiple days. The following error appeared in the form:  'Date of Operation must be a single day for a LAANC enabled airport.' Operations will be conducted in the presence of the Airport Director and in coordination with the ATC Director. In order to maintain an appropriate level of safety; the remote pilot in command (RPIC) holds both a remote pilot certificate and a private pilot certificate. Two or more visual observers (VO) will be utilized to increase situational awareness and safety of operation. The operation will be conducted during visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The RPIC will give way to all manned aircraft. The operation will occur one day within the five day window and will last approximately three hours beginning at approximately XA:00 CDT.The incident occurred in Area C; a 0.2 NM circle centered on Latitude ZZ ; Longitude AA as depicted on FAA Authorization XXXX-XXX-XXXX ZZZ Airport. As required by the authorization I notified tower by phone call that I would be taking off in ten minutes at Area C and that the flight would last 10-15 minutes. I activated the custom DJI Flysafe zone and was operating for about 10 minutes when tower cleared a helicopter to take off from taxiway A with the instructions to remain east of the field. My VO informed me to land the drone when the helicopter pointed directly east. I deconflicted by descending and maneuvering southwards towards the home point and when the drone had descended to about 300 ft. AGL the helicopter banked sharply left to deconflict. I landed the drone after the encounter. The helicopter informed the tower afterwards that a drone was operating to the east of the field. It is of my opinion that the tower should have advised the helicopter that a UAS was operating prior to giving instructions to transit the authorized area in which I was operating. When we moved to Area A north of the field; the tower began advising pilots as he should have done prior to our incident in Area C. Also; I should have landed the drone more quickly rather than wait to make visual contact with the helicopter. I had immediately questioned the tower's reasoning behind clearing the helicopter without advising of our operation; however I expected that the helicopter to maintain a south heading east of the field and then transition to an east flight path as opposed to his immediate transition to an east flight path; and therefore did not land immediately.
1880810,During takeoff; we had both master cautions come on with all lights illuminated on the Captain's and First Officers six packs. I rejected the takeoff because I thought it was the safest thing to do. Never before have I ever seen all lights illuminated on the Captain's and First Officer's six packs during takeoff. I would do the same things based on the indications we had on takeoff.
1875753,For me this event occurred one my 3rd leg of the day on day 5 of 6.  For this flight; we were originally supposed to have Aircraft Y.  When we got to the aircraft Maintenance was onboard investigating an open write up that previous crews had reported; fumes of unknown origin.  Maintenance couldn't find the issue and we were assigned a new plane. We arrived to Aircraft X and soon departed.  On climb out just after rotation; the captain and I noticed a smell but we both thought it was from the [prior aircraft] that took off prior to us. The smell went away quickly.Just before beginning the descent I had started to develop a slight headache. Upon starting descent a few moments later; we both started to smell the smell again.   At this time the Captain said he had a headache and I responded that I had one as well.  He then said he wanted to try something and gave me the radios (I was Pilot Flying and he was Pilot Monitoring) and donned the O2 mask for a couple of breaths. Then put his headset on and asked me to do the same.  I took a couple of breaths from the mask and instantly felt better. I realized at that time we were definitely experiencing fumes of some unknown origin in the flight deck and that it wasn't us just being paranoid because of the fact that our original plane we were supposed to fly had this exact issue written up.  I took my mask off and could really smell the fumes.  I told the Captain I instantly felt better on the O2 and I can really smell the fumes now.The Captain immediately called for Smoke/Fire/Fumes QRC.  At this time we were already descending on the STAR into our destination (maybe 15 min out).  Captain took over the aircraft and radios while I ran the QRC then QRH.  We started the QRH and requested special handling with ATC.  The Captain called the FAs (Flight Attendants) and informed them of the situation and they could not smell any fumes in the cabin.  We asked ATC to notify our Dispatch for us.  We continued on with the QRH and stopped the QRH when we got to 'RAT Manual Deploy Lever ........ PULL'.  We agreed to stop the QRH as we were less then 10min out from landing and did not want to put ourselves in an electrical emergency situation. Shortly after; we entered icing conditions and 'ICE CONDITION' along with 'STALL PROT ICE SPEEDS' appeared on EICAS. After loading ice speeds in we got a master caution for 'A-I WING FAIL'. After identify/cancel; Captain called for A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We then realized the bleeds were out from the SMOKE/FIRE/FUMES QRH and stopped the A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We broke out of the clouds about 5 seconds later and landed safely within a couple of minutes.  We were met on the ground by Crash Fire Rescue and notified them that we did not need any assistance and were good to continue to the gate.
1922436,Boarded the aircraft and the crew immediately smelled the dirty socks/locker room smell. Was told it would decimate...but it got progressively worse and Flight Attendants suffered from headaches; irritation of eyes and scratchy throat. One of the F/As (Flight Attendants) got dizzy and almost passed out.
1913789,On taxi out we were cleared to spot X.  Approaching the spot the F/O (First Officer) contacted ZZZ ground and we were given the clearance to taxi to XYR via Taxiway 1 and Taxiway 2 with clearance to cross [the crossing runway].  Still approaching spot X and Taxiway 1 both the F/O and myself noticed a VERY FAST TAXING 737 approaching from the gate ramp area heading directly towards Taxiway 1 instead of spot Y or Z that would have been assigned by ramp control. The F/O then made the comment 'I don't think he is going to stop!' to which I replied 'I don't think he is either!' Then to avoid a collision; I started breaking; HARD! Then we hear the 737 call ZZZ ground for clearance to which ground replies; '[callsign] follow the Airbus on your right......unless your going to cut him off....which I see you already have...well.... I guess go ahead and go first.....taxi to XYR via Taxiway 1 and Taxiway 2 cross [the crossing runway]. Aircraft Y replies with a disingenuous 'sorry'.In my opinion and observations the Captain of Aircraft Y was taxing aggressively; recklessly; and carelessly to intentionally 'beat us' to Taxiway 1. He didn't have clearance from ground; never slowed down; and made no effort to take ownership of his mistake. Aircraft Y was on their last leg of their trip and was obviously 'pushing' to get home to their base. I waited a day to sleep on the events before reaching out to the ZZZ1 Chief Pilots office on how to proceed. His recommendation was to go through professional standards first; which I did. The results were not encouraging or corrective from the offending Captain. He didn't take ownership of his dangerous actions or feel he did anything wrong even in light of ground admonishing him for cutting us off and his FO responding with 'sorry'. Professional standards described the Captain as 'difficult'. Had this Captain made a poor judgment mistake in his rush to 'beat us in getting home' and showed remorse either at the time of the incident or later when contacted by professional standards; I would have let this go hopefully knowing that this Captain wouldn't do it again to someone else. Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case. I strongly believe this Captain needs to be disciplined on the safe operation of the aircraft and not play 'chicken with jets' on the ramp creating collision hazards.
1867196,Aircraft Y; a gyrocopter in the pattern at ZZZ utilized lower altitude to take advantage of right of way rules cutting off 2 aircraft in the pattern. Aircraft Y made a crosswind call in front of other traffic on the departure leg. During final approach in the pattern Aircraft Y laterally displaced themself right of the centerline; and proceeded back across the centerline in front of my aircraft causing a near mid air collision.
1875655,During cruise flight at FL350; FLT CTRL SYS B became inoperative. We completed QRH procedures which directed us to place the FLT CTRL B switch to RUD STBY. This also created additional failures in Diff Feel and Yaw Damper Fail. We also noticed that 'A' system hydraulic fluid appeared to be decreasing. Since we were not yet halfway and about to go on a portion of our trip completely over water for approximately 500 miles; we elected to turn around to divert back to ZZZ. We considered diverting 300 miles to ZZZ1 and looked at other potential diversion points on the return to ZZZ. We were going to be approximately 2;000 pounds overweight; so we [requested priority handling] in accordance with the FOM and company policy. During the approach the flight controls were sluggish. The approach and landing were completed per the 737 QRH Overweight Landing Checklist; and an overweight landing entry made in addition to the SYS B Failure in the a/c logbook.Suggestions - I think the 737 QRH needs to be reviewed for additional steps on this item. Very brief. Doesn't mention that follow on failures will occur including loss of Yaw Damper and Feel Diff. Additionally there is no information in QRH Overweight Landing Checklist that indicates[requesting priority handling] is required per company policy.
1871835,At cruise; experienced a dual FMC failure over RAAKK intersection.  FMC's powered back on after about one minute.  Reported to ATC and they verified we were safely on course.  ELB (Electronic Logbook) entry made.  Flight continued normally.
1874909,Uneventful until arriving to Company ramp at PWM. Approaching Gate X; silhouette was clear with Marshaler wands up. We observed what appeared to be slush in the silhouette; as a result I taxied approximately 5 knots; slow; steady cautious. The gate has a down slope toward the parking position.  With approximately 30 feet to go; I began braking to further slow. As I applied the brakes; there appeared to be no change in acceleration; I continued to steadily increase brake pressure as it appeared the aircraft appeared to accelerate. With full brake pressure applied; within approximately 10 feet of the planned stopping position; and no indication the aircraft was stopping; I extended the Thrust Reverses; (TR's) Passing the expected stop position; I began applying reverse thrust; however; it was at this point; the aircraft began to decelerate to a stop. It turns out the Reverse thrust never went above reverse idle; before stopping. After stopping; the tug was connected to reposition the aircraft. Debriefing the Maintenance Personnel who was also the Marshaler; he observed the main gear began sliding side-ways during the approach to stop. No damaged was noted by aircrew or maintenance; nor were any flight manual limits exceeded; but all parties acknowledged it was a very close call. The Maintenance Personnel said he requested salt and sand support from the airfield prior to our arrival; but was denied. It seemed PWM was aware of the ice fouling the ramp; which was under the water and slush observed on the surface. Failure to notify aircrew of the hazard is a cause. However; had the airport authority properly treated the ramp and taxiway area; the hazard would have been abated entirely.If ice is known to foul the parking spot; send a note during the in-range ACARS message to expect a tow in. If that window of opportunity is missed; drive the tug out and give marshaling directions to set brakes and shutdown. Of course; having the parking area properly treated would have solved most of the problems.
1927089,While descending on the STAR; the EICAS warning message 'LAV SMOKE' illuminated. I could hear the forward lavatory smoke alarm activating. We initiated the LAV SMOKE QRH and called the Flight Attendants to assess the forward lavatory. The Flight Attendant reported no observed smoke. I asked her to verify that the trash can was not smoking and check all around the LAV to confirm there were no remnants of a cigarette. No apparent source for smoke was found and no smoke was directly observed. My initial judgment based on this was that the LAV SMOKE alarm was false. I had the Flight Attendants check a second time and cross check each other that there was no smoke in the lavatory. The First Officer and I elected to continue to ZZZ. Shortly after; the Flight Attendant called back and said that she was smelling an unusual smell (which she later described as an 'oily smell') emanating from or around the lavatory. I asked her if the other Flight Attendant on board smelled this also; and she stated she did. The forward lavatory smoke alarm was still active when I received this call. They stated no smoke was visible; but were clearly concerned about the smell. I did smell a faint odor from the flight deck at this point but cannot accurately pinpoint it. Based on this information; given I now had two separate sources indicating a potential problem; I consulted with the First Officer about options and elected to divert to ZZZ1; which we were nearly right over at this time. Preparations for landing then consumed all of our energy and we did not troubleshoot the LAV SMOKE indication further. We executed a normal landing and taxi to the gate. ATC rolled the trucks for us. In hindsight; there were two additional things I would have done. First; the First Officer and I never donned oxygen. The preparation for landing occurred quickly and my priority was to get on the ground to troubleshoot the combo of LAV SMOKE indication and figure out what the Flight Attendants were smelling. When I switched to 'divert' mindset; putting on oxygen would have been a smart move to ensure the pilots would be protected if fumes intensified. Also; I would have more clearly said we were requesting priority handling. Since I did not clearly say this; the First Officer was confused for a moment exactly what he should say to ATC about our decision to divert.
1878269,I was pushing back my flight when one of my Wing Walker try to stop me but I thought he was stopping me because of the fuel truck that I thought I had clearance off so I keep on pushing the aircraft an almost push back into an Aircraft Y that was sitting right behind me while the other Wing Walker never stop me which was a close call I own my mistake for not stopping the plane when the first Wing Walker try to stop me lesson learn.
1888668,Descending from 10;000 to 6;000; ATC instructed us to slow to 210 kt. The Captain selected LVL CHG and tried to set the speed with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP (Mode Control Panel). He then noted that the airspeed would not change with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP. All three airspeed indicators matched so we knew it was not airspeed unreliable. We tried different vertical modes and turned the autothrottle off and back on and still could not change the speed with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP. We finally decided to [request priority handling] as a precaution and turned off the autopilot and autothrottles and continued the approach. We landed without incident. At touchdown the MCP speed indicated 193 kt. but aircraft speed was at VREF+5. [I suggest to] maintain aircraft.
1929897,During post flight an area was discovered on right wing that appeared to have indicated we hit something airborne. The area does not look like we hit something organic; there is evidence of a heat signature and the fairing has exposed composite. We never saw anything however I am wondering if we grazed a drone. The aircraft static wicks are all intact and we never encountered any weather. I do not believe this to be a lightning strike.
1897140,During preflight planning; I read the valid Maintenance Release and saw a write up that was worthy of further review. The write up was a cleared write up that is normally seen as an auto-generated write up associated with MEL XX (A Hydraulic system quantity indication - flight deck). However; there were no MELs on the Maintenance Release. I called Maintenance Crew for a consult. He explained to me that the write up was cleared simultaneously with the MEL. The primary argument was the fact that the MEL was not on the Maintenance Release and it was a valid Maintenance Release. Additionally; the A hydraulic system was indicating normal. Based on those two facts; I accepted the aircraft. After arriving in ZZZ; I checked hydraulic system A. It was not indicating normal (RF 65%). Additionally; the auto generated write up appeared again breaking the Maintenance Release. I called ZZZ MX (Maintenance) they said the MEL was cleared improperly in ZZZ1. I am not sure what that means. But it seems to me it is likely that the Hydraulic system level was checked IAW MEL XX. But the MEL was signed off as cleared instead of complied with.
1866945,Mission: Local IFR for multiple practice approaches at ZZZ. 2 persons aboard; PIC and safety pilot/instructor CFII. Aircraft went through a comprehensive proper pre-flight inspection. Engine start and checklists were completed and were normal. Engine run-up to include magneto checks and prop governor check were satisfactory. All engine instruments were indicating 'Green'; i.e. normal readings. take-off run was normal and all engine instruments/indications were normal. Full-power take-off was normal. At 700 ft. power was adjusted for climb power setting when engine roughness was noticed. There was no reading of the #2 EGT during climb out. Tower switched to Approach control and Approach Control issued a new heading to 240. As the aircraft turned left from 330 to 240 engine roughness increased and continued to increase violently. [Priority handling was requested] and aircraft was cleared to land on Runway XX. Aircraft landed uneventfully on the Runway. Upon exiting the Runway on the next available Taxiway the engine quit. Speculation; water-ice in the fuel tank. Temps were extremely cold. Aircraft was topped off with fuel 8 days prior. The aircraft was stored in a heated hangar. Possible solution; extraordinary care should be taken to drain adequate fuel from the tanks when weather condition are conducive for moisture/water/ice in fuel tanks.
1916958,I was in a climb about 10 miles north of ZZZ to 11;500 as the air was cold and my C172 was climbing well when I felt like a sudden loss of engine power. The RPMS kept dropping and rising as I pumped the throttle. I immediately felt like I was losing my engine and requested priority handling with ATC. They started vectoring me towards the airport for an immediate landing. After about 3-4 minutes ATC suggested I pull the carburetor heat; which fixed the issue. I did have to keep the carb heat in for 6-7 minutes to fully melt the carb ice in the carb. Once I felt the situation was back under control I canceled the request for priority handling and continued to my destination at 9;500 feet back to ZZZ1.
1919238,I was Pilot Monitoring. On the ILS 12 the auto pilot disengaged with a red warning message at around 3000 ft. while capturing the glide slope. The Pilot Flying re-engaged the autopilot; and the airplane continued on the ILS. The airplane was struggling to slow down as flaps and speed brakes were applied. Around 2000 ft.; we noticed a yellow caution auto pilot message with no aural. At the same time the plane pitched forward below the glide slope. The Pilot Flying disengaged the autopilot to re intercept the glide slope. It was at this time; around 1800 ft.; that the Tower reported a low altitude report to us. We told them we were correcting. The Pilot Flying re captured the glide slope and continued hand flying down to the runway without further incident. Failure to respond quickly enough to the autopilots deviation on the glide slope. Be more vigilant of the glide slope/localizer deviations while auto pilot is engaged.
1867077,On the 4th leg of the day and short overnight due to getting in 2 hrs late the night before. Leaving ZZZ1 to ZZZ; the weather was clear and planning for a Visual; but backing it up with an approach per the company night visual policy. We choose the RNAV XX due to wanting something other than the ILS and not having flown the RNAV XX other than in the simulator. Once airborne and talking to Center we got slowed to slowest possible speed due to a MedEvac ahead of us on an approach to ZZZ. The MedEvac canceled IFR and allowed us to get cleared for the RNAV XX. We briefed it up as a visual backed up by the RNAV so I did not brief the notes on the approach. Flying the approach when turning final; I notice the PAPI was showing 4 red and thought that odd. I prepared to disconnect Autopilot and climb to the Visual Glide Path; but wanted to see what the approach was doing. Due to being close to the airport and seeing the ridge prior to the airport; I did not want to look at the notes to see if there was a note about the VGSI not coincident. About 200 feet above minimums the GPWS gave a Terrain Terrain warning. I promptly disconnected the Autopilot and climbed to follow the VGSI. We landed safely and checked the altitude to see if our altimeter was set incorrectly. That checked within 10 feet. During the taxi to the ramp; I noticed the cold weather temp comp was required for temps less than -7 deg. When stated; the Captain said something like that should't be the factor; then he looked at the DATA card which was on his yoke; and noticed that the temp was -13 degrees. Captain commented that the cold temp would probably account for the couple hundred feet low on the approach. Lessons learned brief notes when we probably will be flying an approach that ATC clears us for. Try to incorporate Temp Comp which is currently not allowed with any FMS approach even for visual approaches.
1883310,Encountered wake turbulence on the RYDRR2 arrival LAX from a B777. Took evasive actions routing and descent path.  I could not stabilize our approach to 24R due to residual wake and made a go around/missed approach. Returned for approach 25L and made a normal approach and landing. Red eye flight. In a very stable air mass. Wake turbulence was severe enough to change headings and descent paths for avoiding injury and aircraft damage.
1904965,Our aircraft was on the take-off roll. A contractor's truck approached the runway without making a radio call. We aborted take-off; the truck stopped prior to the hold short line; and sufficient runway was remaining; so we continued the take-off roll as it appeared the truck was holding. After we restarted take-off roll the truck then approached the runway and entered the runway environment again made no radio call. Our aircraft took evasive action by lifting off as soon as safely possible; the truck was well past the hold short line and estimated 50 ft. from our left wing tip during evasive action.
1878386,Hour and a half out of ZZZ get an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) that comes and immediately goes away. What was that? Then it came back for a little longer: HYD G RSVR LO LVL. And quickly goes away. HYD system page shows low green quantity; just above the amber range. ECAM comes back and stays on. Run ECAM actions; QRH; discuss our understanding together; talk with Dispatch and MX (Maintenance) Control; inform ATC of situation; requesting special handing by ZZZ Tower due to no nose wheel steering after landing; brief inflight and customers. Inflight code yellow; as normal landing expected; except for stopping on runway; and tug to gate. Landed uneventfully on Runway XXL. Super tug to gate; ZZZ MX noted large amounts of hydraulic fluid in gear bay.
1892957,"On final approach into ZZZ to runway; Captain called for Landing Gear down and Flaps 15."" Flaps ceased to move beyond flaps 10 degrees. We elected to go around and requested vectors to run the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) and opted not to accept holding instructions due to the fact that the autopilot would not engage. Ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree and continued to be vectored southwest of the field until ready for approach on the long Runway (XX). Captain elected to [request priority handling] and I agreed. Insufficient time to notify Dispatch.  very busy right seat due to no autopilot. Captain flew the aircraft and got the radios. Non-normal performance data was loaded and we continued the approach following QRH guidelines. There was some discussion about the speeds; but in the end it was agreed that the speeds were correct. Flaps were extended to 15 using alternate flap extension procedure. QRH finished to completion prior to landing. I notified Flight Attendants of the malfunction and Passengers subsequently as well during the vectoring. Flight Attendants were very professional and informative. Asked Tower to roll the trucks just in case. Landing was uneventful. We taxied off the runway and had trucks conduct visual inspection of the aircraft. After that; and brake cooling calculation; we decided it was safe to taxi to the gate. Passengers and In-flight Crew were very positive after opening the cockpit door. I think I heard applause from the back during landing roll-out.After speaking with the Captain one day after this event; he said he had called the Company to discuss further in depth regarding the failure.  At the time of the event it was impossible to ascertain what caused the flaps to cease normal operation.  Captain subsequently described his conversation with Maintenance and explained that they stated two of the flap transmissions had seized. This in turn prevented autopilot engagement.  Perhaps that is why we always hand fly no flap or reduced flap approaches during training?  I am not sure how we could have prevented the flaps from seizing. It's becoming clear to me that the fleet is aging as more and more mechanical issues crop up."""
1896768,This was my first solo flight and my original intention was to do three full-stop taxi-backs. I landed on [Runway] XXR and exited the runway via [Taxiway] XX and then taxied back to Runway XXR via [Taxiway] XY. I did not perform the after-landing checklist and the carburetor heat was left on and flaps were left at 30 degrees. ATC provided clearance to takeoff on [Runway] XXR and fly straight out. I started to take off with carb heat on and flaps at 30 degrees and did not note this error until I observed that the plane was not accelerating normally and was beginning to lift off the ground around 40 kt. when rotate speed is 55 kt. I put the throttle to idle but was not able to maintain directional control and the aircraft veered off of the runway into the grass between Runway XXR and XXL. I was able to brake the plane to a full stop in the grass and then taxied back onto Runway XXR and requested that the flight be terminated and taxi back to parking. This experience emphasized the importance of the after-landing checklist so that all procedures are followed to ensure safety.
1891036,Aircraft X was issued 1;700 ft. in a 1;700 ft. MVA. The aircraft was direct ZZZ requesting a visual approach. I stated that 1;700 ft. was the lowest altitude I was going to be able to give him and to have him a position report of the airport and instructed him to report the field in sight. The pilot said 'Roger'. I observed the aircraft descending and issued a low altitude alert with the appropriate phraseology; stating what the MVA was in the area and to ensure that he was at an altitude of 1;700 ft. The lowest I observed was 1;300 ft. about 10 northwest of the airport. He responded by climbing and saying roger; adding that he was VFR in the rain. He then came back shortly after and said he would like vectors for the GPS approach into ZZZ and that the Tower was advertising a ceiling of 5;000 ft. but he could see the field. I responded by issuing a climb to 2;000ft. and a vector to the final approach course.In my opinion; this was strictly a pilot error. I should have been clued in to watch him like a hawk even more so because on check in from ZZZ1 Approach; he checked in saying he was turning direct ZZZ (not the flight plan given by ZZZ1) to avoid weather; which a pilot can't just do without requesting a course deviation first. I just immediately responded 'cleared direct ZZZ' to alleviate any issues on both ends. The initial check in was also missing his assigned altitude which is required by the AIM. There were a couple of what I thought to be slight course deviations when he was nearing the airport (again without asking) but as the plane was at 020 at the time and no other airplanes around; and the deviations weren't that noticeable; I didn't take issue with it. When I issued 1;700 ft.; I thought me saying 'that's going to the LOWEST I can get you... report the field in sight' that that would have been an extra heads up to the pilot that he can't descend any further.
1870168,On approach to ZZZZ airport ATC instructed us to Maintain 300 Knots. ATC further instructed us to slow to 250 Knots. After slowing to 250 Knots and just after the chime below 10;000 I receive a call from [Flight Attendant name 1]; informing me of a strong odor I the back of the aircraft. I informed her that we were flying direct to the airport and the safest option was to proceed to the airport and that we would be landing inappropriately 10 minutes. After landing we called the cabin to ascertain the situation.  We were told that the odor had dissipated; so we proceeded to the gate.  After the passengers disembarked; I talked directly to [Flight Attendant 2] who first reported the event. She informed me of a strong odor in the back of the aircraft that caused her minor eye irritation. No other passengers or dead heading crew reported an odor; so it was likely limited to the aft section of the aircraft.
1882701,Aircraft had MEL 34-XX-X and MEL 34-XX-Y. ATL was conducting ILS Runway 26R. I was flying had nav1 signal for LOC 1 with IGXZ on PDF. The LOC became intermittent working and red flag in VMC conditions. Corrected each time but was vectored around for another approach. During this apprise the FO (First Officer) NAV 2 LOC was working. Briefed the changes due to FO will be flying now. When cleared for approach the Flight Director failed and came back. Still VMC and then the FO nav 2 loc 2 went red with red loc flag; which went back to green. Told ATC again there was a problem. Low on fuel we diverted to ZZZ. Discussed with Dispatch. Landed with 1;600 lbs. ATL Approach was very helpful and understanding. Loss of reliability with navigation NAV 1 and NAV 2.
1905596,I was working DSide 88/97 on the 97 scope. The low sector; 98 was split off due to traffic saturation. Thunderstorms had kept the 97 and 88 sector busy all day. 98 Rside attempted to call over the line but ended up hanging up and verbally coordinating an unrestricted climb into ZZZ1 up to 41000 ft. 97 Rside told 98 Rside about traffic at 31000 ft. and 35000 ft. 98 Rside acknowledged traffic. Shortly after; the ZZZ1 airspace was turned on. Shortly after that the Aircraft X flight became airborne and we got the automated tag. Under the assumption Aircraft X was only climbing to 29000 ft. because it was Non-RVSM; 97 Rside accepted a point out of Aircraft X and flashed the data block back. We both observed Aircraft X flight's data block climbing quickly. At least 5000 FPM. Again; we assumed Aircraft X would be stopping at 29000 ft. so Rside did not call traffic for Aircraft Y at 31000 ft. Aircraft X data block jumped from 290 to 299 and simultaneously Aircraft Y reported it was responding to an RA due to traffic less than 100 ft. beneath them off of their left side. Aircraft X flight was not inside the ZZZ1 airspace yet so the Non RVSM was absolutely a factor. 98 Rside admitted to releasing Aircraft X unrestricted to FL300 and did not realize the Non RVSM. I'm not sure what altitude the Aircraft X stopped its ascent. I think most of the time this isn't an issue. I believe it was mainly 98 Rside not realizing or overlooking the non RVSM of Aircraft X. If there were any procedures to be changed it would be to only allow unrestricted climbs to the top of each sector and coordinate once the aircraft is airborne. However; again; I think the climbs into the ZZZ1 areas are usually fine and this particular incident was on the Controller.
1930069,I was performing a flight instruction with my student; it was his second flight as a student pilot. After performing brake test I gave my student the flight controls so he could proceed and taxi as required per lesson 2. We got cleared to taxi to the runway by Ground. As we were approaching the run up area my student applied excessive left rudder. [I called] 'I've got the flight controls' to correct and align the aircraft back to runway center  line. I applied right rudder and brakes but the brakes from the right seat of the aircraft didn't respond. We stopped at the edge of the taxiway and run up area for the runway with no damage to the aircraft or airport environment.
1876841,While in flight at level cruise at FL320; I was in the bunk in the rear of the aircraft when I noticed a power reduction. Immediately afterwards; the seat belt sign illuminated and I made my way to the flight deck. There was a FLAPS DRIVE EICAS with an expanded flap display indicating that the right mid-span leading edge flap deployed. As a result the airspeed band became very tight between Mmo and the yellow band as the FMC wanted to honor the maximum flap extension speed. This was in close proximity to our stall speed. The auto throttle was disconnected and the Pilot Flying manually maintained Mach. 75. We consulted with the company via sat-phone and were advised to return to ZZZ. We coordinated with ATC for the return and fuel dump. An uneventful landing was made below MLW.
1883088,DATE Flight from ZZZ1-ZZZZ. After departing ZZZ1 during our climb to altitude we received numerous A/I WING HOT R Crew Alert System messages. We ran the check list for above Crew Alert System message performing action described. After Crew Alert System message reoccurred with all anti ice off and reducing power on the right engine the crew decided to [request priority handling.] After discussing the situation with operations the decision was made to change our destination to ZZZ2 because that was the closest suitable airport with VFR conditions not requiring a descent through icing condition. Eventually the Crew Alert System message went out and stayed out. The flight proceed without further incident.
1912738,I was working the ZZZ Sector with some afternoon arrival traffic. I received a handoff from ZZZ1 with Aircraft X. I told them to expect the RNAV Runway XXL and descended them to 050. I then went back and cleared Aircraft X to cross ZZZZZ at or above 047; cleared ZZZ2 approach. The pilot read it back correctly. I subsequently slowed the aircraft after the clearance and read back. During my scan; I saw Aircraft X at 042 outside of ZZZZZ in a 044 MVA. I issued a low altitude alert and asked if they had the field in sight. They did so I cleared them for a visual approach to eliminate the MVA requirements; Aircraft X proceeded on the visual; ended up calling traffic ahead in sight; and followed them in landing without incident. This is a tough event to prevent a reoccurrence of from the Controller side because I verified that the read back was in fact correct; even listening to the audio after the fact. Somehow in the cockpit the restriction got lost as far as I can tell. Luckily in this instance; I observed the aircraft descending below my issued restriction quickly and ensured that VMC allowed them to be on a visual approach. The low altitude alert was definitely necessary to prevent a further descent. I will continue to scan at all times to continue to try to catch these errors in the future; and issue alerts as necessary to correct instances like this.
1913321,I was working lunch relief shift. At XA:19 I was covering H alley ramp control for 15min break from XA:20 till XA:37. Relieved ramp controller advised inbound aircraft holding on the pad for X5. No movement in the alley. Gate X8 schedule departure XA:25 request push at XA:21. HX push was approved at XA:21 aircraft pushed at XA:21:18. X8 push to east taxi line complete XA:23:18. X14 schedule departure XA:30 request push XA:25 and approved for push. X14 pushed XA:25:33 to the east taxi line. X14 push complete at XA:27:00. X14 request taxi XA:28 approved out East taxi line aircraft taxied at XA:28:29. X8 request taxi XA:29 approved taxi out east line at XA:29 aircraft moved XA:29:15 number two in sequence on the east taxi line of the H alley. X4 schedule departure XA:30 request push XA:29 and approved. X4 pushed XA:29:38 on to the east taxi line; tail south. X10 schedule departure XA:35 request push XA:29 held for taxi traffic off X8. X8 cleared east taxi line behind X10 at XA:30:25. Y5 request push and approved XA:30.Y5 pushed at XA:31:01 to the west taxi line complete at XA:31:53. X10 push approved XA:31:07. I stopped X10 push at XA:31:45 when I realized lack of clearance for the push with aircraft off X4 in push back. X10 stopped on the push line just at the start of the turn off X10. X4 push was not stopped and was complete on the white box a beam gate X6 at XA:32:07. Y11 request push XA:33 and approved. Y11 push to west line complete XA:33:40. Y11 taxied at XA:36:35 number one on the west line. Y5 taxi at XA:36:09 number two in sequence on the west line. Aircraft X4 taxi approved XA:36:39 in sequence number three on the west line. [Relieved ramp controller] returned from break at XA:37 I advised X10 push was held and to resume push once aircraft off X4 taxi to west line. X10 resumed push at XA:37:02.As I monitored the push off X4 to the east line tail south and saw pushing past red box; I immediately stopped the push on X10. Aircraft was still on the X10 taxi line and had just started the turn. I apologized for the stop and advised will resume shortly; explaining I had observed there will not be enough room with the push off X4. I turned to my co-worker; the turn coordinator for zone 3 (gates X18; X16; X14; X12; X10; X8; X6; X5; X4); I advised I stopped the X10 push in case ramp control called asking questions. I advised of the alley traffic and plan to continue the push after aircraft X4 taxi to the west line.X bottom of the east line of the alley has two push boxes one red between X4 & X5 gates; one white box for main line between X5 & X6. My shift assigned lunch relief to cover all breaks for ramp control and turn coordinators on shift. I work from my position relieving each employee for their assigned breaks. I had just relieved H ramp control for [their] 15 minute break at XA:19.  Relieved ramp controller advised inbound aircraft holding on the pad for Y5. No movement in the alley. I was on leave of absence for X days for covid-19 illness. No idea why I mixed up the red box for the push point for main line from X4 & X5 pushes; but I did. When I approved the push for X10; my vision was X4 was pushing with nose on red box lower in the alley than the white box on the east line.I managed the X alley ramp traffic and took safe actions to correct my error. No aircraft made contact; no ramp fleet service employees were outside the X10 taxi area. As the events unfolded my manager asked why I thought there was clearance to push X4 & X10 mainline aircraft. I advised I confused the white and red push boxes on the east line. Apologized for my confusion and advised I stopped the X10 aircraft from completing the push to the east line; and will continue the push after I clear the alley traffic. Not to confuse the push boxes on the east line of the X alley. Working as lunch relief there is no time to pre-plan departure pushes. I have to react; pick up where my college was working to relieve them on breaks.
1920493,Cleared RNAV M into Runway 29. Received low altitude report from ATC for below 5K over ANN based on 2000 ft. at or above at CEPKU. Missed programming 5K at or above ANN. Loading the arrival with the ANN transition does not provide an altitude at ANN. VMC at the time Center provided low altitude alert. Did not cancel IFR until landing; but remained VMC for remainder of approach. Captain (CA) was Pilot Flying (PF). First Officer (FO) was Pilot Monitoring (PM). No operational impact. Remember to program 5K at or above at ANN; when not given an altitude restriction by ATC on the arrival for RNAV M to 29. Loading the arrival with the ANN transition does not provide an altitude at ANN. Recommend 10-7 addition to crews.
1870360,During the descent into DEN on the NIIXX 3 RNAV arrival we received ECAM messages for the loss of ADSB-1 and 2 RPTNG passing through approximately 13;500 feet in the vicinity of BSTON waypoint.  While continuing our descent we lost GPS-1 signal at about 11;500 feet and then GPS-2 signal at about 7;500 feet.  We assume that this was due to 5G interference.  We reported these items to DEN Approach and submitted the appropriate error maintenance codes.
1881087,Planned departure of XB:40 from ZZZZ. We arrived at the aircraft at XA:40 to a dark flight deck with only the ground service bus powered. This was the fourth flight of a three-day trip for the Captain-in-training during his first OE sequence. This was also the Captain-in-training qualification flight to/from ZZZZ. The Captain-in-training was the Pilot Flying (PF). ZZZZ had a 1000 ft. ceiling that was clear above 2000 ft. AGL. After a normal takeoff; the right seat Pilot Monitoring (PM) instructor noticed the gear was not retracting and informed the PF the gear were not coming up. Since we were climbing at the 0/Ret Minimum Maneuver speed until we were clear of terrain; we were climbing at 215 kts. We asked to level at 9;000 ft. and hold over the airfield at the ZZZZ1 VOR. It was suspected the nose gear pin had been left in and was possibly missed during the salute. I had considered running the 'Landing Gear Lever Will Not Move Up After Takeoff' QRH. However; the conditions were not met because the gear handle did move up. An attempt was unsuccessfully made to retract the gear by recycling the gear handle. The aircraft was below maximum landing weight and we had a safe landing configuration; so the decision was made to return to ZZZZ to have the suspected bypass pin removed if that was the problem. Upon returning to the gate; it was discovered the pin was not left in the nose gear and Maintenance found no faults in the gear operating system. Upon returning to the flight deck; the Instructor Pilot discovered the manual gear extension access door was ajar. The light on the aft pedestal was not illuminated during preflight and we were not aware of when that door was breached. Upon resetting the access door on the flight deck floor; the light on the aft pedestal extinguished and it was clear we had resolved the problem. An INFO-ITEM was entered into the Approved Model List and the aircraft departed and flew to ZZZ uneventfully with a 60 minute delay.OE training; hit city special qualification airfield training; terrain; weather; ATC foreign communication.Ensure the manual extension access door is firmly closed during every preflight and before takeoff.
1921565,Near departure time; The flight crew called in that the Fwd E&E Door indicated open. I found the Fwd E&E Door upon my inspection. I cycled the forward plunger switch several times and then closed the door. The flight deck indication remained on. I placard the door warning light indication per MEL XX-XXA. After takeoff the aircraft would not pressurize and air interrupted back to ZZZ. The event occurred because both E&E Doors were left open for unknown reasons. The crew complaint was about the Fwd E&E Door. This became my main focus. To avoid this situation in the future i would do further troubleshooting and inspection and ignore the pressure of an on-time departure. For whatever reason the doors were open they should be closed.
1896719,While on initial approach into ZZZ; I was cleared for the RNAV-XX via the ZZZZZ IAF. I was given the restriction to cross ZZZZZ at 4000 ft. I compiled with this restriction; then began my descent after crossing ZZZZZ for the next altitude. I selected 3;300 ft. on my altitude pre-select for the leg from ZZZZZ to ZZZZZ1. However; I didn't realize until crossing ZZZZZ1 that I selected the wrong altitude. On the Jeppesen charts; the altitude for the leg from ZZZZZ to ZZZZZ1 is in an inset; and the altitude for the leg is not prominent. While writing this report; I compared the NACO chart for the approach; and noticed that the altitude for this leg is presented in the same way as other legs. Just after noticing this error; Approach issued a 'check altitude' alert; but at that point; I had already crossed the ZZZZZ1 fix; and was at the appropriate altitude. Due to the fact that I was already at the appropriate altitude for this leg; there was no required corrective action. My initial training and check-ride was done using NACO charts; and I've only switched to Jepp charts in the last 2 years. In the future; I'll have to brief charts more carefully; and perhaps cross-reference against the NACO chart before beginning the approach; when workload is high.Contributing factors are high workload phase of flight; IMC conditions with continuous moderate turbulence; recent change in instrument charting provider and fatigue after 3 hour flight out of complex airspace
1917127,Departed ZZZ; Aircraft X; to ZZZ1 on Date. Approximately 100 E/NE ZZZ2 while at FL340 at XA50Z; while deviating north for weather; the flight crew received a Master Caution and ECAM for HYD SYS LO PRSR for the Yellow Hydraulic System. Subsequently; a FLT CNTRL ECAM was received due a partial spoiler deployment (#4) on the right wing. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying and the Captain was the Pilot Monitoring. All QRC; ECAM; QRH and follow-up procedures were completed by the Pilot Monitoring. While the Pilot Flying continued the weather deviation; the Pilot Monitoring conferred with dispatch on flight options and diversion details; to include the NOTAMs for ZZZ2. A request for priority handling was made and a diversion to ZZZ2 with ATC priority radar vectors for descent. Coordination via a precautionary landing brief to the flight attendants and passenger PA were also completed. Additional information regarding the partial spoiler deployment was obtained via communication between the Pilot Monitoring and the number one Flight Attendant via a visual inspection of the right wing. There was a noticeable right wing dip at altitude and increased buffet and droop during the descent and approach phase of flight. The Pilot Flying executed a visual approach; with the electronic means of backup using the ILS XXR to an underweight landing (132;000 pounds). After clearing the Runway; an Airport Rescue and Firefighting vision inspection was executed; with the crew confirming flight crew suspicions of hydraulic fluid loss along the belly of the aircraft. With the Green; Blue hydraulic systems intact; the aircraft was taxied to Gate XX. Cause was determined to be the mechanical failure of Yellow System Reservoir. ECAM status page mentions approach phase procedures which result in return of HYD SYS LO PRSR ECAM warning (engine pump on) which can confuse with electric pump on since both work with Yellow System.
1899105,Departing XXL using a properly loaded flex takeoff; engine 1 failed to spool with engine 2.  Engine 1 EPR hung at 1.1 EPR as engine 2 spooled properly.  The adverse yaw forced a low speed rejected takeoff twice.  Maintenance ordered a gate return.
1912821,Westbound on NAT C at FL350 in Shanwick Oceanic our offset was zero. When we encountered minor wake from the preceding aircraft 1000 ft above. The Captain who was pilot flying announced to me that he was going to offset L1 to get out of the turbulence. We applied L1; verified and executed in the route page. At the time of execution I was thinking that something is not quite correct but didn't think too much of it after. Eventually we changed crew for break; the Captain was going for his break and the Relief Pilot was coming back; and a changeover briefing was accomplished including we were offset L1. A [few minutes later] Gander queried us via voice saying that they show us offset L1. We responded affirmative and there was no further communication. It was at this time that the Relief Pilot (who was now the PF) realized and pointed out that he didn't think we were allowed to offset Left. They confirmed by looking in the QRG/ FOM that Left offsets were not authorized and switched immediately to R1.
1894590,On the short final of Runway XX at ZZZ; I got very close to an aircraft that is conducting a missed approach to Runway XX because I misjudged their speed. There was also a confirmation bias on my side that created the situation. Below is the detailed explanation of the situation and corrective actions I should have taken. On downwind; I noticed the aircraft performing a RNAVXX approach into ZZZ by looking at the Foreflight traffic information. Then; right before I was abeam of the departure end of Runway XX; I heard the aircraft making a position call over the CTAF saying 'Aircraft Y; 5 miles final RNAVXX; low approach only.' With this information; I assumed that the aircraft is a single-engine aircraft and I presumed that they are shooting the LNAV approach; which was totally wrong. Then I checked their groundspeed via Foreflight and saw them flying around 105 kts.After getting the information; I was wondering whether I should extend downwind or start the base turn; then with my wrong assumption of his approach minimum; I decided to turn to the left base of Runway XX in front of the traffic because I thought there will be enough space between us. About 1.5 NM/1 minute horizontal separation when they execute missed approach. On the base leg; I had the aircraft in-sight; and the separation between us looked acceptable at the moment; so I decided to continue my landing. I could have gone around on the base leg and departed to the east at this point that would have eliminated the near-miss situation. During my final turn; the traffic also made a position call saying 'Aircraft Y; on 2 miles final Runway XX.' Therefore; I made a position call stating 'I am on short final Runway XX' in order to let them know I turned in front of them. I should have included the specific concern and said 'I am on short final Runway XX in front of Aircraft Y' so that the Pilot in the other aircraft is also alerted.On the short final; I was flying around 60 kts. ground speed; and I was expecting them to decelerate to 85 kts. ground speed and level off at LNAV minimum because I was presumed that they are doing LNAV approach. Then I saw the aircraft continuing to descend to the runway at a relatively faster speed. At this point; I finally recognized that my assumption was wrong and they are doing LPV approach to missed approach. I decided to continue my landing because I didn't want to penetrate their missed approach course and get closer while climbing each other. The aircraft executed a go-around right before the threshold; I am guessing at the LPV minimum; and departed to the north after that. There were many chances to confirm that the aircraft is performing missed approach at a higher minimum by asking on CTAF; executing go around earlier and depart the pattern; or changing my course of action to follow the traffic; however; I chose the worst option available for each decision making process and got close to the aircraft by misjudging their ground speed and presume their intention.
1893730,"Received 'L ENG BLEED' amber caution message on climb out; followed by 'L COWL A/I' amber caution message. I was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for the and directed the First Officer (FO) to continue the climb and maintain aircraft control; while I ran the Quick Reference Card (QRC) and Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and covered the radio. I ran the L ENG BLEED QRH procedure. The procedure directed us to; 'Leave icing conditions to prevent ice accumulation on inoperative cowl'. As we were then operating in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC); I directed the FO to continue the climb visual meteorological conditions (VMC) which were forecasted at our planned final cruising altitude. We reached VMC conditions and I communicated our situation to ATC and Company Dispatch (including company maintenance through ACARS). I conveyed to each that we would need to descend in VMC conditions to our destination if able. ATC advised us to inform the next Controller and handed us off to the next sector. There was confusion apparent with both ATC and the Company regarding our situation. I attempted to state as clearly as possible that we would require VMC descent from our cruise altitude. We were then given a descent clearance through IMC ahead. I declined the clearance and again made our situation known - that we were unable to enter icing conditions. ATC queried several aircraft on the arrival ahead of us. All reported IMC but negative icing. ATC relayed this to us and; I believe; again issued a descent clearance. When I declined again; ATC informed us that no aircraft had reported icing in the descent. I stated that we would be unable to accept a clearance into any IMC conditions as that would put us into conditions conducive to ice formation as defined by our Pilot Operating Handbook; and that the negative reports of the aircraft ahead were inconsequential to our current condition. I asked for a hold at altitude so that we could consult with the Company and asked that ATC offer assistance by checking other potential ZZZ2 arrivals or a radar vectored descent to ZZZ2 or any nearby airport with VMC conditions from our altitude to the surface. ATC said that they; '...cannot see clouds;' but that they would check. We were assigned; and entered; a hold at ZZZZZ1; where I conferred with our Company Dispatcher who checked weather at ZZZ3 and ZZZ as requested; however apparently also misunderstood the situation and suggested that we were okay to descend through IMC; after having consulted with a Supervisor. The FO and I separately calculated bingo fuel and were within 100 pounds of each other. I informed the dispatcher of remaining fuel on board (FOB) and our time remaining until bingo holding fuel. As we neared our bingo fuel the FO and I made the decision to divert to ZZZ as weather conditions were most clear there and our descent would put us through the least amount of IMC within our range. We requested vectors to ZZZ and [requested priority handling] due to the required entry and descent through IMC/icing conditions. I also informed ATC of minimum fuel status at this time. We were vectored and subsequently assigned the ZZZZZ 3 arrival into ZZZ. I informed Company Dispatch that we were diverting to ZZZ; had [requested priority handling]; and stated our FOB. We descended through IMC into VMC conditions as I finalized programming the FMS and approach. ATC requested a statement of flight conditions. I relayed that we were now VMC. ATC asked if I was cancelling the [priority handling]. During these transmissions I showed the FO our updated fuel numbers with the arrival and long-side approach to ZZZ now built into the FMS. Our new fuel-over-destination (FOD) calculation was 1830lbs; which was below our required planned reserve of 2224lbs. I elected to maintain [priority] aircraft status and relayed this to ATC with an explanation of the new [situation] being [priority] fuel.' We continued the arrival. On arrival; it seemed that several aircraft were being vectored to land ahead of us; and we were tracking away from the airport; albeit on the ZZZZZ 3 arrival. I asked ATC for a turn direct to the airport; was questioned; and I again stated that we were [priority] fuel and do not want to be flying away from the airport. We were then given a vector towards the field and assigned landing Runway XXR. Once I cleaned up the approach in the FMS our fuel numbers were again above required reserve amount. FO landed the aircraft at 2130 FOB."""
1873617,At approximately 1000 ft. just outside 3 miles in VMC to Runway 8 at JAX; the First Officer's radio altimeter intermittently would go out (was replaced by an amber RA) and then come back. The Captain's radio altimeter worked the entire time. We also had our Autoland Status indicator go blank. It had previously shown a green Land 3 indication. JAX does have a 5G NOTAM for Runway 08; but we also have a Alternate Means of Compliance approved for all runways at JAX. 5G?
1893908,At 7;000 ft. MSL; heading assigned 250 degrees to intercept [Runway] 17R final approach course and cleared for visual approach 17R; I intercepted final and descended to 6;000 ft. MSL prior to Joule which is not below [the] floor of Class B but below MVA. ATC alerted us MVA was 6;500 ft. I climbed back to 6;500 ft. and intercepted GS and proceeded visually with the approach and uneventful landing. TDZE at DEN 17R is 5;392 ft. MSL. Weather conditions were VMC (clear skies' light winds from the East).
1919171,After getting a canceled approach clearance due to birds on the runway we executed a non-standard go around procedure and entered the traffic pattern as directed by ATC. Once re-cleared for the approach we turned base and started a descent. During this time a momentary 'OBSTACLE' aural was heard and corrected immediately by overriding automation. The rest of the approach and landing continued normally and we debriefed the event. Non standard go around and approach procedure on unfamiliar area. High workload environment. Stay higher on visual approaches to unfamiliar airports.
1928528,Taxiing out of ZZZ we got a number 2 HP Bleed Fault and after ECAM and QRH procedures contacted Dispatch and Company and returned to the blocks. Number 2 HP bleed valve was deferred and we departed again. Flight was uneventful. Landing was normal and Captain used idle thrust with normal indications. After clearing Runway and communicating with Ground and Ramp the auto throttle paddle clicked off; ECAM alerted and ATS would not reset. I also noticed number 2 TR showed unlocked and pointed this out to The Captain; who verified TR lever was fully down. Taxied into parking and shut down; and viewed damage on cowling.
1919202,While on the decent into ZZZ; approximately 13;000 feet; the right engine failed. It was a standard arrival with the FO (first officer) as PF (pilot flying). I was jump seat observer during the flight. As we were already in an idle decent there was no major power loss feel; just a slight bump noise. This was followed by the A/T Disconnect warning sound which brought our attention to the EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System). We began noticing all the messages associated with a generator loss and the oil pressure red boxed. We all collectively confirmed a right engine failure. The CA directed the FO to continue as PF; started the APU; notified ATC and requested a heading and level off altitude of 10;000 feet. As observer I also pulled up the Engine Failure/Engine Shutdown checklist and assisted in the confirmation and analysis. We confirmed that we still had N1 and N3 rotation; oil quantity; no high vibrations; and nothing that would indicate severe damage. Per the checklist; the right engine was shut down and then driven to a restart. With the windmilling rotation; we had the option for a X-Bleed start which was performed and was successful. As we performed the checklist; ATC gave us a turn to the left which we accepted. They asked if assistance was needed or if we would be [requesting priority handling]. With the successful restart of the right engine and the checklist complete; there was no obvious need for either. The CA (Captain) then fully briefed in the event of another failure on landing; what the expectation would be and the thresholds for going around or continuing to land. MX (Maintenance) was notified via ACARS message. We then continued and landed uneventfully. Highest threat level was the fact that both me and the FO (PF) were new to the fleet. The startle factor and the lack of an obvious power loss being at idle decent also played a part in the processing and time to begin the checklist. Overall; it is a well-trained procedure. The Captain's leadership in division of duties; excellent communication; situational awareness; workload management and methodical pacing; was instrumental in properly following all procedures. Being new to the fleet; it challenged me to remain current and proficient on all emergency procedures; stay vigilant in my studies and knowledge of the fleet; as well as strive for the excellent leadership the CA displayed.
1888396,I was working R24 for about an hour and a half today. All sectors around my sector were busy dealing with weather deviations and traffic routed from East coast to West coast. I did not have a D-side. During the session I had an aircraft respond to an RA descending above another aircraft. I think I violated W174. I estimate I probably had 3-4 airspace violations with Approach and surrounding sectors. This is/these are the incidents I noticed and/or remember. I did not have time to note aircraft call signs. A D-side would have helped with much of the coordination/airspace violations; but there simply was not sufficient staffing for a D-side. [I suggest] better staffing [and] better flow control.
1887462,Cleared to line up and wait after two minutes cleared for take-off. On beginning of take-off roll; aircraft veered far left on power up while advancing thrust levers; aircraft had no directional control even with large rudder input. Both engines spooled up normally but center line could not be maintained so take-off was discontinued at a very slow speed roughly taxi speeds. Nose wheel steering tiller still worked and we vacated the runway normally per ATC instructions.
1885312,While operating under IFR flight rules and mixed VMC/IMC conditions during an instrument training flight and receiving radar vectors for the ILS the electrical system failed completely. The flight was continued in VMC conditions and landed without further incident at the airport of origin. On the downwind of the ILS the aircraft and crew encountered an area of moderate turbulence in IMC conditions while the student (PF) was flying the aircraft and the instructor (PM) was monitoring. The student was struggling to maintain altitude and heading (+/- 20 degrees; 150 feet) so the instructor (PM) told the student (PF) to fly the attitude indicator and keep the wings level. Once clear of the turbulence the student returned to the assigned heading and altitude. The controller then stated that the aircraft had been flying off course by approximately 20 degrees to the right and the instructor advised the controller of the encountered turbulence as the reason for the deviation. The controller issued a turn inbound to intercept the ILS However; because the student (PF) was not yet prepared for the approach; delay vectors were requested and a turn to 360 was issued. The controls were transferred to allow the student to focus on preparing for the approach without the added workload of flying once the aircraft was on the assigned delay vector heading.While receiving delay vectors for the ILS the student (PM) was preparing for the instrument approach. ATC asked that we once again check our heading as they were showing the aircraft flying approximately 15-20 degrees right of the assigned heading. It was verified that we were on the appropriate heading on the HSI of 360 and checked the magnetic compass which indicated 020. The instructor (PF) noticed a message had come up on the Garmin G5 that we were using as the primary instrument source which read 'Not receiving ARINC data'. The instructor (PF) grabbed the STC for the G5 and handed it to the student (PM) asking that they find information on this message and to run the appropriate checklist.The instructor (PF) attempted to report the equipment issue to ATC on the communication 1 radio and the Garmin 430 GPS/COMM1/NAV1 subsequently failed. Realizing this may be an electrical system failure and in present VMC conditions the instructor decided to stay in those conditions and vacate the assigned heading and altitude while the failures were being addressed. The instructor (PF) began a descending turn to return to the airport and to stay below the layer of clouds. The instructor (PF) attempted to contact ATC on the communication 2 radio and was not able to contact them however was still able to hear the instructions and altitude alerts for deviating altitude and heading assignments. The instructor (PF) squawked 7600 and continued to contact ATC once more to no avail. The communication 2 radio and the transponder failed soon after. This occurred within a time frame of approximately 2 minutes.To begin troubleshooting the instructor (PF) looked at the ammeter and it was showing an indication of 0; the high voltage light was not illuminated; and there were no circuit breaker faults. Because this was an un-annunciated electrical failure the student (PM) was instructed to turn off the master switches; as all of the electrical components had failed; in accordance with the checklist.The flight was continued under VFR in VMC conditions. The student (PM) was able to use their handheld radio to make contact with the ATC tower and advised of what had happened. The tower issued a landing clearance and the aircraft landed safely without further incident by the instructor (PF).Maintenance personnel were able to determine that the battery had suffered a catastrophic failure.
1907541,My student and I were going for a dual training flight at XA:30 local time at ZZZ. We did the run up on the [FBO] ramp and the ground check was within the manufacturer's limit. When taking off; we had a small drop of RPM and power went back to normal; we aborted the takeoff and did another ground check. Everything was within the manufacturer's limit. Then; we departed and on the climb; we noticed a weak climb performance. Therefore we decided to make a precautionary landing back at ZZZ. After landing; we did another ground check on the [FBO] ramp and everything was within limits. We parked the plane and squawked the plane for maintenance inspection. Waiting for maintenance action.
1893170,Aircraft X flew into ZZZ with a COMM 1 and 2 issue. During much troubleshooting; the crew and mechanics reported seeing an 'ADC' (Air Data Computer) Amber msg on both PFDs. The COMM issue was resolved; then we began troubleshooting the ADC msg. During troubleshooting; I had the Mechanics power off the aircraft for around 30 minutes. When the Mechanics returned to the aircraft; I then had them disconnect both ADC Cannon Plugs and wait another 5 mins before powering on. I did not consider this to be an 'Installation' of the ADCs as is marked in the Required Inspection Item (RII) List. The Mechanics reconnected the Cannon Plugs and continued troubleshooting; as the Aircraft Power Down was not a fix. Later still during troubleshooting; the ADC Ops check was performed by a non-RII Mechanic; which at the time i did not realize was an RII Task.I will familiarize myself more with the RII List and be sure to always check and double check the List when sending roadtrips or asking Mechanics to perform tasks. I missed the 'System Check' Field of the ADC RII Listing before asking mechanics to perform the ADC Ops Check.
1875753,For me this event occurred one my 3rd leg of the day on day 5 of 6.  For this flight; we were originally supposed to have Aircraft Y.  When we got to the aircraft Maintenance was onboard investigating an open write up that previous crews had reported; fumes of unknown origin.  Maintenance couldn't find the issue and we were assigned a new plane. We arrived to Aircraft X and soon departed.  On climb out just after rotation; the captain and I noticed a smell but we both thought it was from the [prior aircraft] that took off prior to us. The smell went away quickly.Just before beginning the descent I had started to develop a slight headache. Upon starting descent a few moments later; we both started to smell the smell again.   At this time the Captain said he had a headache and I responded that I had one as well.  He then said he wanted to try something and gave me the radios (I was Pilot Flying and he was Pilot Monitoring) and donned the O2 mask for a couple of breaths. Then put his headset on and asked me to do the same.  I took a couple of breaths from the mask and instantly felt better. I realized at that time we were definitely experiencing fumes of some unknown origin in the flight deck and that it wasn't us just being paranoid because of the fact that our original plane we were supposed to fly had this exact issue written up.  I took my mask off and could really smell the fumes.  I told the Captain I instantly felt better on the O2 and I can really smell the fumes now.The Captain immediately called for Smoke/Fire/Fumes QRC.  At this time we were already descending on the STAR into our destination (maybe 15 min out).  Captain took over the aircraft and radios while I ran the QRC then QRH.  We started the QRH and requested special handling with ATC.  The Captain called the FAs (Flight Attendants) and informed them of the situation and they could not smell any fumes in the cabin.  We asked ATC to notify our Dispatch for us.  We continued on with the QRH and stopped the QRH when we got to 'RAT Manual Deploy Lever ........ PULL'.  We agreed to stop the QRH as we were less then 10min out from landing and did not want to put ourselves in an electrical emergency situation. Shortly after; we entered icing conditions and 'ICE CONDITION' along with 'STALL PROT ICE SPEEDS' appeared on EICAS. After loading ice speeds in we got a master caution for 'A-I WING FAIL'. After identify/cancel; Captain called for A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We then realized the bleeds were out from the SMOKE/FIRE/FUMES QRH and stopped the A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We broke out of the clouds about 5 seconds later and landed safely within a couple of minutes.  We were met on the ground by Crash Fire Rescue and notified them that we did not need any assistance and were good to continue to the gate.
1920006,On taxiway returning to hangar via newly reconstructed taxiway. Due to pilot looking down at taxiway surface to find a lost object; A/C came too close to the right edge of the taxiway and the right tip tank contacted a paving roller machine parked about 3' from the edge of the taxiway. Minor damage to the forward; outside surface of the tip tank. Tank pushed in a couple inches; crack in the tank allowing fuel to leak out.
1922866,While on the take off roll at; at approximately 85 kts. airspeed; a red CAS message occurred. The message indicated MAX ITT Temp exceeded. I initiated a high speed abort and contacted Operations Control and Maintenance. Software glitch. New software update for aircraft.
1900347,Attempted to lower landing gear for landing Runway XX at ZZZ and unsafe landing gear light came on with no green lights. Attempted to cycle gear multiple times with no green lights. Checked fuses. Checked bulbs. Performed emergency landing gear extension and got 2 green lights (left and nose). Attempted multiple aggressive rudder movements to get right main gear to lock down. Heard traffic in pattern at ZZZ. Requested visual on gear extension from plane holding short. Got verbal that landing gear appeared down. Attempted slow soft landing. Gear held for few seconds while plane slowed. Then right main gear collapsed. Controlled slow exit from runway onto grass. Avoided all runway lights. No injuries. Notified airport manager who helped get plane back to hangar.
1874920,We completed the NIXX3 arrival with no issue and ended up on a left downwind for Runway 17R. I was planning the ILS 17R for backup guidance for a visual approach. ATC had us assigned at 210 knots; vectored us heading 330 for a short base; left us at a high altitude; and cleared us for the visual into 17R effectively 'slam dunking' us to the runway. We began self factoring ourselves to intercept final at the FAF. We were left at 210 knots and high so we lowered the gear and began using spoilers to slow down in order to configure flaps. I switched to green needles to intercept the localizer and armed approach mode. Because we were so close there was a delay for the course to come alive which in turn caused a delay in our intercept and for us to begin overshooting final. The Captain took controls and the autopilot was disengaged to correct for this and we received a bank warning during the correction as we touched 45 degrees. There was no traffic interference and the slight overshoot was promptly corrected back to centerline on final. Immediately after once back on centerline during the configuration process ATC issued a low altitude warning at a radar altimeter of 960 feet. We verified we were slightly low; the captain added power and we climbed to 1;300 feet. The Captain verified the transfer of controls back to me; and I leveled out to re-intercept a proper glide path while continuing to configure. All proper call outs were made; no aircraft limitations were exceeded; and by 1;000 ft we were stabilized and cleared to land. The remainder of the approach; landing; and taxi was uneventful.The three main causes were ATC could have set us up for a better approach; task saturation; and autopilot reliance/I should have just hand flown the approach from the beginning instead of trying to have the autopilot intercept final.The main thing that can be done to avoid this is when using autopilot use white needles to intercept final when we're so close to the runway; or just hand fly the approach and use outside visual ques.
1903510,While on a 1-mile final to Runway 8 at BIV a drone was noticed hovering 50 feet from the aircraft right side (south of our course) between 400-500 feet AGL. The drone appeared to veer briefly after we passed. The drone was quad bladed 1-2ft in diameter; Black with Gold accents. Reported to the ATC facility once on the ground. Airport staff was unable to locate anyone on the ground in the immediate area and other aircraft did not see the drone as they approached the runway two minutes after our arrival. No action was needed for collision avoidance due to the lack of motion.
1928467,"On approach to BUR; we were cleared for the ILS to Runway 8. We were in the middle of configuring for landing when about the time we were passing VNY airport; ATC (Approach) gave us a traffic advisory for an aircraft on our right that would be passing below and behind us. I looked down to see a converging symbol about 500 feet below us and instinctively turned off the autopilot anticipating a TCAS. Immediately following we received a 'monitor vertical speed' then a 'Climb' call and symbology. I hand flew the maneuver as required and noticed that the plane symbol appeared right below us at 400 feet. I want to say we were at flaps 15 and decelerating below 170 kts at the time though it all happened very quickly. We notified Approach we were responding to a TCAS RA. Soon after we received a 'clear of conflict' message. Approach asked if we wanted to continue; and we said Yes"". I finished configuring and we were able to get back on the glideslope and hit the 1;000 foot mark fully stabilized. The landing was uneventful.Personally; this was too close for me. I understand this is a busy place but we had a Controller; another Pilot who should have seen us; and clearance for an ILS approach. The only thing that saved us from hitting that aircraft was the TCAS. We were down to one slice of swiss cheese preventing us from what could have been a major accident. Please talk to ATC and see if there's a learning point for them in this.  We did everything by the book and we almost got killed. Thank the Lord for TCAS and for our airline that has worked so hard on this training for so long. It paid off in spades today and I am thankful for all of you in Safety."""
1930749,Radioactive dangerous goods shows held off on [documentation] however ZZZ confirms shipment received off flight XXX.
1902780,On takeoff from LAX on the ORCA5 departure; we were cleared for takeoff behind an Aircraft Y on the same SID. When we were cleared for takeoff I thought; 'Wow; that guy has just gotten airborne. I haven't been cleared for departure this close behind an aircraft in as long as I can remember!' I then thought; 'Well; the Aircraft Y is smaller than we are; so we should probably be OK.'Shortly after liftoff in IMC; we encountered the Aircraft Y wake turbulence. I had to correct to overcome the rolling tendency; quite a bit actually. A few seconds later; we encountered it again; this time as we were climbing through the tops of the marine layer. We could see the swirling vortex of the wake turbulence in the tops of the clouds and once again; I had to work to overcome the rolling tendency. I thought 'Wow; that would not have been a good thing if we were dealing with an engine failure at the same time; especially during the IMC encounter at the lower altitude!'As we were switched over to Departure frequency; I told Tower about the wake encounter and I think I mentioned how it was a very close proximity between our aircraft departures.
1898612,I departed ZZZ in an SF50 aircraft with X souls on board. Shortly after departure; at approximately 3;000 ft. and not long after we had been handed off to the departure frequency listed on the DP; I received a warning CAS message that read; 'FUEL VALVES BOTH FAIL.' No other abnormal indications were observed. Immediately; I pulled up the appropriate checklist and completed it. The checklist advised me to check the fuel quantity; maintain airspeed for adequate roll control; and land as soon as possible. I called the Departure Controller we had been speaking to and advised him that; per the checklist; we needed to land back at ZZZ. He asked what the nature of the concern was; and I let him know that we had received a warning message regarding our fuel valves; and that the checklist advised us to land as soon as possible. He also asked if we would be needing any emergency services; to which I said no.At this time; I did not intend to [request priority handling] myself; as we still had fuel flow (the valves fail to the open position); and I knew that a possible eventual fuel imbalance was the pressing concern; but that due to our proximity to the airport; we should be on the ground before that would become an issue. However; out of precaution; the Departure Controller advised me that they would be [giving us priority handling]. Following this; the Controller asked us how we would like to be vectored back; and I requested vectors to final for a visual approach to Runway XXL. We joined the approach and landed with no issues. On the ground; we were met by the ARFF team; who inspected the aircraft from their trucks; and let us taxi back to the ramp once they had visually assessed the exterior of the aircraft. The occurrence turned out to be somewhat of a non-event due to quick use of checklists; utilization of resources including assistance from ATC; as well as help from my safety pilot (who was able to alert our company of the occurrence; and assist me in other tasks; such as calculating lbs of fuel on board).
1898657,On a flight on Date around XA:00 local. I started feeling an unusual vibration; I thought that I should make a precautionary landing; as soon as possible. I turned the ship into the wind; I found a safe place to land; far from people/property. I was safely able to land the aircraft; I shut the engine down to inspect the ship. As the rotor was coming to a stop; the rotor struck the tail boom.
1915567,While flying about 7 NM west southwest of SHD airport under VFR; I had a near-miss with a drone. The drone passed above my plane by about 35 ft. I was maintaining a visual scan for traffic in accordance with recommended FAA procedures. However; because the drone was so small; I didn't see it until it was just passing above me; leaving no time to react. The drone appeared to be black and blue in color. To prevent this from happening again; I feel the FAA should place stricter regulations on drone operators as well as teach other pilots how to scan the sky for smaller flying objects such as drones. Additionally; I hope the FAA will investigate this incident as it could have resulted in serious injury to me or my passengers.
1898172,While descending through 12;000 ft. we received a Flap Fail Caution and Spoiler Fault status message. We ran the appropriate QRH message did not clear. We elected to [advise ATC] and divert to ZZZ which offered longer runway options due to the the landing distanced required. Completed the appropriate QRH procedure and elected to land at ZZZ.
1927390,While loading flight to ZZZ at Gate; I received a at around -20; marked medically urgent; containing Dry Ice. I checked the Dangerous Goods site for Dangerous Goods Form and no DG's were scheduled for the flight. So I assumed the dry ice marking was incorrect; scanned the Important package & entered the listed weight & loaded the package into the A1 compartment. I found out today that the package was an actual Dangerous Goods (DG) when I was told I would have to answer some questions by management. I was loading the plane & thought this was just another important medical shipment and made sure it was on the flight. I wasn't there in ZZZ1 & am unable to describe what happens when they received the package. [In the future I will] refuse packages marked as DG if there is nothing listed in the DG site for Dangerous Goods Form
1929778,Weather exploded east of ELP; traffic quickly began to overwhelm the controller on Sector X who was working Aircraft X. Frequency congestion was a nightmare; the gigantic sector; the multiple transmitter sites; the planes all calling to deviate; and the bottleneck around ELP; Mexico; White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The Controller was extremely busy; I was listening to him go down the tubes. I started out on the D-side on Sector Y and we were quickly in the same boat as the Controller on Sector X. Sector X Controller realized too late that Aircraft X was deviating north towards [Restricted Area] R-XXXX which was active FL300 and below. After taking the hand off; I realized the same thing; the Sector X Controller gave a hard vector south to a 190 heading and used the term immediately. I saw conflict alert go off with the Aircraft operating in R-XXXX; which we think was a military drone. The TCAS didn't go off on Aircraft X. The Pilot of Aircraft X checked on stating he turned south to miss a drone; not sure if that was an evasive maneuver or from the heading given from the Sector X Controller. We had to go into no notice holding as we got so busy; we couldn't insure separation of aircraft from each other or the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The weather quickly built and traffic quickly overwhelmed the SE specialty. Command Center / Traffic Management Unit (TMU) constantly neglect the complexity of us working traffic through this area. There is a lot of pressure for us to not hold; not lower the map numbers; not route planes north. I would recommend that we have a specific Pro-day for the SE and SW specialties to practice different routes and holding scenarios; and also have upper management encourage us to take this action sooner rather than waiting and trying just 'make it work' or 'just get through this shift'. There is a pernicious attitude that pervades both the SE; management; Traffic Management Unit and ZAB as a whole to never do this; that we change this culture.
1900691,At approximately XA30 local at ZZZ; as Pilot Monitoring; upon rotation we received an inadvertent stall and shaker warning once the wheels left contact with the ground. Our IAS was approximately 80 kts. and increasing passed 100 throughout the time the shaker and stall warning was going off. I took the controls from my SIC and became Pilot Flying as PIC and inhibited the pusher; and pulled the pusher circuit breaker as well. All other indications refuted a stall and we were unable to land immediately; we continued our climb into the upwind and [requested priority handling]; reentered the pattern and successfully landed without incident on Runway XX. Upon landing we exited the Runway and taxied back to the FBO without further incident; after alerting ATC of our [incident]; safe return; and cancellation of our flight plan.
1881221,Shortly after take off #1 Iinertial Reference System failed causing Pilot's PFD (primary flight display) to quit working. Flight controls were transfered to the Copilot and after not being able to recover the failed IRS it was requested to TRACON the return to ZZZ. We were asked if we needed priority handling and the response was negative. Aircraft was degraded in navigational aids and vectors were requested in VMC conditions. Since the moment the aircraft took off until landing the flight was uneventful apart from the situation above mentioned.
1909318,On DATE; myself and another technician were tasked with a CAT (Category) II functional check on Aircraft X. Both of us worked on setting up for the task and going over the steps for the functional check. After the functional check; both of us removed the equipment that was needed for the check. I didn't install the static-port screws into the static ports; but assumed that the other technician did. The other technician wasn't signed off on the CAT II functional check; so the two of us stamped all the blocks of the work card.On Date 1; I was notified that the static port screws weren't installed. I will insure that this issue doesn't happen again by verifying the aircraft condition before stamping the work card. Also; I think this issue can be eliminated by making the removal of the air-data kit; a RII (Required Inspection Item) item; for this work card.
1887191,During Cruise Flight at FL430 the aircraft experienced multiple electronics and avionics failures. Crew responded via maintaining control of the aircraft and running the appropriate checklists and after a brief discussion we [advised ATC] and asked to divert. Checklist final item was 'land nearest suitable'.We were closest to ZZZ but due to loss of anti-icing controls and the multiple overcast freezing layers over ZZZ we asked ATC for weather at nearby airports. We chose ZZZ1 due to its proximity and higher ceilings as well as broken layers; not overcast so we could avoid icing conditions during the descent as well as the lack of significant crosswind for Runway XX.ATC vectored us to the RNAV XX approach and we landed without incident.The root cause was a loss of MAU2A (Modular Avionics Unit) due to CB failure. Significant items lost included anti-ice control; AT; AP; Spoiler Control; MCDU2; FMS1; AHRS2 and ADC2; Gear Status Indication. The aircraft was flying fine; however the computer systems were no longer able to verify the accuracy of data input so many systems were considered 'unreliable'. For example; engine anti-ice fails to on; but we have no way of knowing if they were working or not. The same for gear. We lost gear indication and despite feeling and hearing the gear deploy; we asked ZZZ1 Tower to confirm gear down while on 3 mile final. Given confirmation; we continued with the landing in lieu of a fly-by.Things that went right: The Pilot Flying did an excellent job maintaining control of the aircraft at all times; freeing me up to concentrate completely on checklists; navigation; and setting up for the approach and landing. ATC provided excellent services giving our arrival priority and providing any information we requested. One significant bonus to [advising ATC] was that ATC knew I would not be able to answer radio calls immediately. This relieved a major stress factor (distraction) in a near task saturated environment. Thank you ZZZ Center; Approach and ZZZ1 Tower! In addition; company X has done an excellent job training us for this particular situation. Aside from a dual generator failure; this particular failure may be one of the most stressful. FS ZZZ2 did an excellent job of preparing us for this exact situation.Things that went wrong: One of the things we lost was Gear Status indication. The checklist says that lack of an aural warning after gear down and flaps 35 indicates that the gear is properly deployed. In the simulator; this makes perfect sense. However; in the actual airplane on final for an actual landing; it does not feel quite as comfortable. Pilots are used to a positive indication of gear down. In this case; it was a lack of negative indication that we needed to rely on. These are not the same thing. I am not sure what the solution would be; but during the entire event - the gear situation was the one we were most uncomfortable with.In 30 years of flying; this was the first time I ever [requested priority handling]. Due to excellent assistance from ATC; excellent training; and a professional calm response from both crew members - it was a non-event.
1935911,Runway 04 PAPI lights and runway lights inoperable. Not listed in NOTAMS.
1894221,During taxi out on Taxiway Alpha abeam Charlie 20; I had to abruptly apply the brakes because Aircraft Y taxied straight in front of me. We were not issued instructions to stop for them.
1917496,I was en route on an IFR flight plan from ZZZ to ACK. I was talking to Boston Approach on 188.2. ATC initially routed me direct at 3;000 ft; and later cleared me direct to HOKEL (heading ~ 160 degrees) for the RNAV 15 at ACK. Approximately 2nm NE of FMH; I entered IMC in cumulus clouds. I briefly exited and re-entered clouds once or twice. Around XA:44; ATC instructed me to descend to 2;000ft in preparation for the approach. The next events occurred over approximately one minute. During the descent; ATC reported 'Military traffic 12 o'clock; less than 3 miles; orbiting at 3;000ft' I responded 'looking for traffic; but I am in the clouds.' About 20 seconds later ATC stated 'I don't know why they are descending; turn right heading 240' I set the autopilot to turn to 240 and repeated the instructions to ATC. Shortly thereafter; ATC gave another traffic call with more urgency in his voice; 'Traffic 12 o'clock; less than a mile; appears to be descending; indicating 2;200; turn right 240.' Again I repeated 'right 240'. A few seconds later ATC gave new instructions 'Traffic is now turning; turn left 150' and I set my autopilot to 150 and repeated the instruction. Around this time I checked my ACAS (traffic screen) and saw a Traffic Advisory symbol overlaid on the own aircraft symbol showing -3. This indicates that the aircraft was very close and about 300 feet below my aircraft. A few seconds after beginning the turn to 150; we exited the clouds and immediately saw a military airplane. The aircraft was less than 500 feet below us and offset from us by only a 100 feet or so. The aircraft was in a nose-low right bank and passed beneath us and out of view. I reported 'traffic in sight' to ATC and was then returned back on track to HOKEL and completed the rest of the flight uneventfully.
1879937,Aircraft X departed ZZZ on a SID. The aircraft was not flying the procedure correctly and in doing so was creating a traffic situation with an arrival on an instrument approach. I observed the identifier and turned aircraft to avoid traffic. I also verified which procedure the pilot was flying. Even though I had radar identified the aircraft I forgot to tell the pilot he was [in] radar contact. The pilot continued to have problems following headings then I noticed a 360 turn and the pilot was having trouble with his altitude. I had the Controller In Charge tell ZZZ of the situation because it looked like the aircraft was going to crash. I asked the pilot if he [needed assistance] and could he just level the plane. He did and regained some control of [the] aircraft. Overall the plane lost autopilot all navigation; gyro; directional gyro; horizontal situation indicator. I climbed the pilot to VFR conditions with no gyro vectors to VMC. We then got him going to VFR airport. Landed safe with ZZZ1 center.During this event ZZZ contacted a pilot who has flown this aircraft. He said this plane did this last week. He helped us and the pilot troubleshoot during the event. My suggestion is why wasn't the plane fixed. Was it worked on? Was the pilot notified of the occurrence before? ZZZ FBO in my opinion does some things I don't like for cost savings and I hope this wasn't one of them. I don't know if the plane was worked on or not. I hope this is investigated. The pilot of Aircraft X almost lost his life in an out of control spiral and could have crashed and might have crashed into an arriving aircraft as well.
1936972,Departed ZZZ with IFR flight plan to GYY with destination of C77. Cancelled IFR with South Bend Approach due to no access to Chicago Class B airspace for GA flights. Climbed to 10.5 to go over top of Chicago Class B and approaching Lake Michigan requested VFR flight following to remain within gliding distance of the shoreline. Shortly thereafter was vectored by ATC to turn further north whereby I advised ATC this was beyond gliding distance to shore. As a condition of continued ATC flight following services I had to accept the turn or services would be terminated. So continued the flight out of gliding distance of the shoreline for approximately 7 minutes while asking for easterly turn toward the shoreline. Floatation/lifevest on board does not make this a safe or acceptable practice.Proceeded over the top of Chicago Class B at 10.5 navigating direct to C77 Poplar Grove and three 737s at 11000 caused wake turbulence advisories to be issued by ATC. After flying through the first wake I requested descent and with no traffic below/ahead ATC refused the descent approval to enter the Chicago Class B. Continued through wake of 2nd 737 however avoided the 3rd 737. My flight was trapped between the top of the Class B at 10;000 ft. and heavy traffic at 11;000 ft. resulting in an unsafe condition with no clear solution.Chicago ATC practice is to exclude GA aircraft from Class B access as a standard practice even though no published policy exists in the TRACON facility manual. This exclusion of GA aircraft from Class B access created the above unsafe flight operations for this flight and creates unnecessary risk for GA aircraft operations daily.A survey I took of GA pilots in the Chicago area found the above over water and wake turbulence exposure risks occur on occasion. Please use this report as the basis to begin creation of solutions to the above issues.
1880955,ECAM Messages/Warnings:AUTO FLT AP OFFF/CTL ALTN LAW (PROT LOST)F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 2INOP SYS:F/CTL PROTELAC PITCHAP1&2CAT 2Unable to manually trim the stabilizer. Roles:Captain: Pilot Monitoring (PM)First Officer (FO): Pilot Flying (PF)Deadhead FO: DH PilotAt approximately XA:20 while approaching way point ZZZZZ on Airway at FL380 the autopilot #2 disengaged with an associated ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF. After an evaluation and finding no cause for the autopilot disengagement the autopilot #2 was re-engaged. Within minutes the aircraft pitched up slightly; as if in mountain wave; climbing approximately 70 ft. above the cruise altitude and an ECAM message F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1 displayed. The aircraft then slightly pitched down to 70 ft. below cruise altitude and immediately ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF; F/CTL ALT LAW (PROT LOST) and F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 2 displayed. Pilot Flying began hand flying the aircraft. We began the ECAM Procedures. I called the #1 Flight Attendant and instructed him to have the deadheading First Officer come to the cockpit immediately. Deadhead Pilot and I re-evaluated the systems failures and determined that the systems/computers could not be recovered. I then [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center and requested FL260 since we could not stay in RSVM airspace without an autopilot. This also allowed a wider airspeed regime between Vmo and Alfa PROT in case pitch control became more of problem. Pilot Flying noted that the control input forces were increasing as we descended at 280 kt. indicated. We attempted to manually trim the aircraft with the pitch trim wheel; but the stabilizer appeared jammed at -0.8 up. I attempted to call Dispatch desk via the Crew Call app but reception was poor. Deadhead pilot looked up the ZZZ Commercial Radio frequency for me and I established communication with the Dispatcher and Airbus Maintenance desk. Maintenance advised us that if there was not a fix in the QRH there was nothing he could do for us. The aircraft was under control and Pilot Flying was able to override the now mistrimmed stabilizer with his side stick. The three of us and the Dispatcher then began discussions on diverting to the closest long runway. Something in the 8;000 to 10;000 ft. length range with airspace enough to configure; evaluate and handle any pitch problems that may present itself as we configured for landing. The four of use decided it was prudent to divert to ZZZ1 which was 140 NM away (120 miles closer than ZZZ2).I [requested priority handling] and informed ZZZZ Center that we were experiencing a flight control problem and request vectors to ZZZ1. ZZZZ gave us an off-airway vectors of 090deg then 100deg so to fly around restricted airspace while ZZZZ called for permission for use to fly through the restricted airspace direct to ZZZ1. I asked Deadhead Pilot to handle the radio communications while I briefed the flight attendant and passengers on the diversion and anticipated non-routine landing. The flight attendants were briefed for a non-routine landing. When done with cabin briefings and passenger address my attention returned to Pilot Flying and Deadhead Pilot. By this time; we had been handed off to ZZZ Center. I found that we were still flying the 100 degree heading. I queried ZZZ Center for the reason of this extended vector and was told it was because of restricted airspace to our north. I firmly reminded the Controller we were an aircraft in distress with flight control problem [and] that we had [requested priority handling] and if this vector continues; we're going to have fuel problems. I informed him this diversion was becoming pointless since the object of the diversion was to get this aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. I added that I could have been in ZZZ3 by now. We were immediately given a north heading towards ZZZ2.Approximately 20 minutes before landing passing 15;000 ft. (SAT-26) the pitch trimwheel lurched nose down a few inches and began trimming normally. Pilot Flying commented that side stick input forces became normal. The stabilizer continued to trim normally during all speed and configurations changes as flaps were extended. The ECAM messages remained displayed. Deadhead Pilot had completed a landing distance assessment using a non-normal; DIRECT LAW calculation. (Note: A non-normal; stabilizer jam calculation resulted in the same distance) We asked for and received a 20 NM final approach. We completed our applicable checklists and informed the Flight Attendants that we were 10 minutes from landing.Pilot Flying; Deadhead Pilot and I briefed that we would be fully configured and 160 kts. prior to gear extension so that only small a small amount of pitch trim would be required to stabilize the approach when the flight control system degrades to DIRECT LAW. Pilot Flying landed the aircraft perfectly and we rolled out; turned off the runway to taxi to the gate. Pilot Flying commented the aircraft required a firmer side stick input to flare due to the Direct Mode. I made a passenger address assuring them of our safety and thanking them for their cooperation with the Flight Attendant's instruction.I met with the Mechanic meeting our flight and briefed him on our experienced. He was grateful we had stayed to discuss the failures with him. When we blocked in and shut down the engines all the ECAM messages had cleared and only an ECAM Class II F/CTL indication remained. The faults remained in the Multipurpose Control Display Unit>Maintenance>Current Flight Report print out. Deadhead Pilot and I had operated Aircraft X/DATE that morning down to ZZZZ1. Starting the initial decent on the ZZZZZ1 2A STAR into ZZZZ1 we had experienced three autopilot disconnects. The first two occurred prior to the way point ZZZZZ3 on the STAR. ZZZZZ3 was to be crossed between FL230 and FL210. Prior to the third disconnect I saw the pitch trim wheel jerk forward approximately an inch. An ECAM warning would flash on the display then disappear. Descending below FL180 the autopilot was re-engaged and was used for the remainder of the STAR and RWY XXR LOC and GS capture. The pitch trim worked normally as we slowed on the arrival and configured for landing.At gate arrival in ZZZZ1; we called for Maintenance and described what we experienced. Maintenance printed a Maintenance Current Flight Report from the Multipurpose Control Display Unit which indicated warns of XU:23 AUTO FLT AP OFF and XU:27 F/CTL. Failure messages were: XU:21 AFS:ELAC1 and XU:25 AFS:ELAC1. There was a Class II Maintenance Message F/CTL displayed on the Status page. Maintenance went to work clearing these faults.I could not have hopped for a better qualified crew to meet this challenge. I had flown with Deadhead Pilot before; but this was my first flight with Pilot Flying. Deadhead Pilot brought 30 years of Airbus experience to the flight deck including time at various airlines. Pilot Flying brought 22 years of Airbus experience to the flight. Their performance was both profession and stellar. They never stopped working the problem. Flight Attendant 1; Flight Attendant 3; Flight Attendant 4 worked as a team preparing our passengers for a non-routine landing and keeping communications to the cockpit to a minimum during this diversion allowing us to work the problem uninterrupted. I would recommend that Dispatch and Commercial Radio VHF frequency pages found in the FOM be included in the QRH for easier referencing.
1906382,Auto Pilot failed in turn to intercept LOC for ILS 4R into EWR during Fist Officer's leg. Aircraft was in a left turning descent when Auto Pilot failed (possibly due to wake -rolling motion- from 767 ahead). Was unable to reengage Auto Pilot momentarily (5-10 seconds) [and] during this time aircraft continued left turn and descent briefly causing an RA for a helicopter below and to the west of aircraft's position. ATC was informed. Corrective action was taken and aircraft was returned to heading and altitude for LOC intercept. Auto Pilot did reengage successfully moments after this occurred once established on the ILS. Avoid aircraft wake and remain vigilant while monitoring.
1930687,Aircraft X came over to my frequency well outside my airspace at 17;000 feet requesting a ZZZ full stop. I gave him a pilot's discretion descent to 2;100 feet for the approach with a turn to the final approach course. By the time I noticed the rapid rate of descent and tried to stop the descent he was too low for radio coverage and may or may not have heard me. He continued to descend to an altitude that was below the MVA more than 40 miles from our radar site. After several attempts to re-establish communications he switched to my UHF frequency and I climbed him back up to 3;000 feet which is 300 feet above the MVA until he was within 40 miles of our radar site. At that point I brought him back down to 2;100 feet to clear an obstacle north of ZZZ1 airport.  In the future I will avoid pilot's discretion descents that far outside of our airspace. If I do I will make sure that the altitude issued will meet the MVA outside 40 miles of our radar site in case of a rapid descent. Typically pilot's will slow their rate of descent with pilot's discretion so that they can stay at an altitude which will conserve fuel. That was not the case in this event.
1917476,We did the appropriate paperwork and prepared to depart ZZZ for ZZZ1. Picked up our clearance and departed. At some point in the climb we became aware of an odor distinctly that of gasoline. After discussing the notable lack of HAZMAT paperwork and the implications of such an odor we made the decision to turn around. Re-briefed the approach and our plan; called ZZZ Center and requested direct to the IAF for the ILS which we then performed as normal. After arriving back at the airport we opened the cargo door to inspect the cargo and locate the culprit. Upon doing so we discovered a shipment of gas cans (Jerry Jugs) that had not been cleaned properly. We removed them; searched the rest of the load for anything else that we should have been notified of its presence; removed what we could find; and redid the weight and balance. Filed a new flight plan; and departed once more for ZZZ1. The rest of the flight went without incident. A company mandated return report was filed with the appropriate operational personnel.
1893510,I was ramp checked on Date. All my paperwork was in order. The Inspector requested I email him a photo of my aircraft's most current annual inspection. When I was reviewing my logs to make sure everything was clear for the Inspector; I recognized I had misread the propellers AD. I believed I had 500 hours from the previous inspection before the propeller had to be inspected next. The propeller have less than 150 hours since the AD was complied with.
1923197,Flying the FMS Bridge visual 28R approach into SFO approaching San Mateo bridge; received a traffic alert on TCAS.  Autopilot was engaged; exactly on our path; and flaps 20 with gear up.  Identified a light civil aircraft below and to our left.  That traffic was consistent with traffic we routinely see coming out of San Carlos (SQL) airport.  Was comfortable that we would pass over the traffic and instructed my First Officer to select TA position on the TCAS.  As that aircraft disappeared under our nose we were descending through approx. 1;800 feet and I noted a separation of 400 feet on TCAS.  Directly over that aircraft I noted 300 feet on TCAS as we descended through approx. 1;700 feet.  Notified tower of the traffic; and proceeded to normal landing.  Upon landing notified tower that we believed separation of 300 feet complied with definition of NMAC and we would be filing a NMAC report.
1872382,On arrival into MHT; Captain and I received a 1800 FT radio altimeter indication at 5000 FT.
1892517,Reduced PL (Power Lever) to FI in descent. #1 Torque was 31 percent with PL in FI (Flight Idle). Crew considered directional control loss during approach and after landing. Contacted Ops and agreed with inflight #1 engine shutdown for single engine landing. Shut down #1 engine at 4;000 feet and requested ATC vector to ILS. Safely landed and taxied to ramp. FO (First Officer) was flying pilot and started descent from 16;000 feet to 4;000 feet. FO reported CA (Captain) that #1 torque was 31 percent with PL in FI. #2 torque was zero with PL in FI. Crew had reported company several times that #1 Torque gauge indicated 20 percent higher than normal level in cruise with PL in notch. Mechanics troubleshot it and airplane returned to service. The problem happened in first flight after this troubleshooting.Crew analyzed risk and consequences to approach and land with this condition and informed company necessity for in flight #1 engine shutdown for safe landing. Then; CA took control and FO asked company whether we should land at ZZZ1 or ZZZ. Company selected ZZZ and FO requested ATC to vector to set up ILS XX and conduct all necessary checklists. Then; airplane landed on Runway X with single engine safely and taxied to hanger on its own power. Performance test should be done after troubleshooting prior to returning it to revenue flight. If a check flight or a reliability flight after the maintenance was completed; this incident might be prevented.
1889549,While supervising the unload in ZZZ a piece of hazmat that was not seen during the loading process in ZZZ1 was discovered. The hazmat was a class 2 non-flammable gas which should initially have been reported on the pilot notification form.While supervising the unload in ZZZ the hazmat was noticed for the first time. I believe this package went unnoticed while checking the information on a separate box of hazmat.The nature of the hazmat was noted and I called Safety to verify it was hazmat that should have been reported and find out how to proceed. I think this hazmat slipped past me on the belt loader while I was looking at a separate piece of hazmat to add to the pilot notification form. Next time the best idea may be to momentarily pause the loading process when looking at hazmat so nothing goes undetected.
1886930,Aircraft X was on final approach to ZZZ. The crew received an asymmetric flap indication upon final approach. The crew went around and re-configured the aircraft for landing. The aircraft then landed in ZZZ without incident. Upon landing it was discovered that the inboard slats did not extend; and the outboard flaps had extended fully.
1902227,Upon leveling off at our cruise altitude; the Captain and I noticed the trailing edge flap indicator had a split between left and right flap. One was indicating fully up while the other was beyond that showing that it was even 'more up' than the limit. Upon further discussion we agreed that it was probably an indication issue as it's impossible for the flaps to be split in that manner. We decided to extend the flaps early on descent in case of any issues with deployment. At around 10;000 MSL I called 'flaps 1'. The Captain moved the flap/slat handle to the 1 position. There was no indication of motion of flaps or LED's. I remained the flying Pilot and took over the radios after we requested priority and requested a Runway (XXC) from Regional Approach at ZZZ. The Captain and I had a brief discussion on which checklist to use. We agreed on flap asymmetry since that was what the indicator was depicting. We were able to get the LED's extended fully and land via the trailing edge flaps up checklist. Upon landing we taxied to the gate normally with Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting following. Worth note is that after landing the trailing edge flap indicator reverted back to normal.I'm not sure what caused the trailing edge flaps to not extend.
1889956,Aircraft X came off of Runway XXL and asked to go to the ARC from ZZZZZ for the ILS to Runway XXL. They were climbing to 3000 ft. from the missed approach. I thought that I had issued a climb to 4000 feet for the antenna obstructions that were on the ARC. The low altitude alert went off and I issued the low altitude alert and issued a climb to 4000 ft. I should have made sure that the aircraft was climbing to 4000 ft. to ensure that it was the altitude for the antenna obstructions.
1919153,During cruise at FL 350; we received a Master Warning and CABIN ALTITUDE EICAS message. Cabin altitude was approximately 11;000 feet. Crew initiated QRH procedures and descended to FL290 Initially as cabin altitude dropped to less than 10;000 feet. We continued descent to FL250 to stabilize cabin alt below 8;500 feet and [requested priority handling] with ATC. We attempted second auto controller with no different result. Crew landed at destination with no other abnormal indications.
1872448,After an uneventful run-up and takeoff on runway XXL at ZZZ following outlined Diamond DA40-180 procedures found in the approved DA40 AFM; at roughly 100 AGL on climb out; established in a Vy climb the airplane experienced a sudden complete power loss from the single power plant. I immediately took controls from my student who was the pilot flying at the time. Pitched the aircraft forward to prevent the stall warning horn from activating as I saw the airspeed quickly reduce close to a speed that would induce the stall warning horn.I then told the Tower the aircraft was having engine issues and that I was going to land straight ahead. Prior to flare entry; at a stabilized airspeed of roughly 68 kts. I extended the flaps from the normal takeoff position to the landing position. I performed a normal landing with remaining runway and partially exited runway XXL at taxiway 1. Tower immediately told the aircraft on approach to the same runway behind me to go around and asked me if there was anything they could do for me. After the aircraft came to a stop I told them to contact the FBO that services our flight school to get a tug to pull us back to the ramp.After a few minutes Tower asked if we thought we could get the airplane started again. I tried several attempts; switching tanks; using and not using the boost electric pump and different throttle settings. On the initial restart attempt I immediately smelled the strong odor of 100LL avgas. Airport personnel drove up to the airplane and I helped them move the airplane off the runway. My student went back to where we initially came to a stop and noticed that there was a large amount of fuel pooled on the pavement. After a tow back to the FBO; maintenance personnel spent about an hour looking at the engine.I was told roughly 2 hours after the accident by the flight school's Chief Flight Instructor that after a swap of fuel distribution manifolds between the DA40 we were in and another flight school DA40; the maintenance technician incorrectly installed the fuel line fitting that connects the fuel line from the fuel tanks to the distribution manifold by cross threading the connection between the fuel line and the fuel line fitting. The fuel pressure produced by run-up; taxi and initial takeoff did not exceed the force required to dislodge the cross threaded connection; however; once initial takeoff power was sustained; climb power and fuel pressure were established; the connection failed. The airplane completed the corrective service and was test flown shortly after and returned to service.I regularly practice aborted takeoffs after rotation and on initial climb out with my students. Due to the training; I felt proficient exercising the actions that I performed. In the moment I was entirely focused on flying the airplane; however if I had to attempt it over again I would have tried to switch tanks possibly. Both my mixture and electric boost pump were functioning properly; as verified during the run-up and they were already confirmed several times prior to takeoff to be in the correct positions. I was unaware maintenance had been performed on the airplane; but I think from now on I will execute flights following maintenance events with extreme caution; specific relating to the initial takeoff I will use as much runway as I possibly can and will verify my engine parameters on takeoff by introducing takeoff power while holding the brakes prior to beginning my takeoff as one would normally perform for a short field takeoff.
1906018,Flaps failed after moving from 10 degrees to 0 on initial climb from ZZZ. After troubleshooting the issue; decided to make a return to the departure airport. Ran appropriate checklists and the rest of flight was non-eventful.
1897078,Flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 in PA-18. Persons on Board; pilot only. AWOS announced 10 kts. from 090. Flew left pattern to Runway 8. Right pattern is listed on charts. On downwind leg; noticed wind direction had clocked a bit more right. Anticipated a right crosswind on final. Base leg and final leg was nominal. The engine was in full idle (less than 600 RPM) upon landing; received a gust from the right which lifted the right wing and veered the aircraft to the left. Corrected with rudder and put in more right aileron. Recall that the stick was perhaps not in the far back right corner i.e. not full down elevator. Aircraft corrected to right and turn accelerated despite left rudder applied. As the tail of the aircraft started to get to the point that it might be to the left of the main wheels; I became concerned of a loss of control.At this point; the aircraft had slowed significantly and I thought a slight application of the brakes might improve the situation. The aircraft tail slowly lifted and then unfortunately went past the CG (Center of Gravity) and the aircraft nosed over completely. After shutting down the master and magnetos; I exited the aircraft and with the aid of a bystander we lifted the nose and moved the aircraft from the runway. Not giving full elevator authority resulted in the tail wheel not having sufficient traction to maintain directional control once the aircraft slowed past the effectiveness of the rudder. Application of brakes with elevator not in full authority allowed the tail to be light enough to allow the aircraft to nose over.
1935839,Was participating in an event at ZZZ. Pattern was much busier than normal and Tower was issuing rapid fire instructions to aircraft in the pattern and approaching the D. I was flying a right downwind for Runway XX and was told I was number 2 in the sequence behind a Skyhawk. I identified the traffic to follow and began my turn to base shortly after. Upon turning on to a base leg; I saw another aircraft on final. I believe the tail number began with XX and the tail was narrow like a Diamond type; though I am not certain at all.The tail was directly in front of me; so I turned away from final to a 224 heading away from the runway. My first transmission was to report that we had gotten quite close to the other traffic and that I had broken out of the sequence. The Controller came back in an exasperated tone and said they had instructed me to follow the Skyhawk. I didn't respond right away; but then told the Controller I was on a 224 heading and I was fine if I needed to go back to the beginning of the pattern to re-enter the sequence. The Controller indicated I should continue flying westbound and standby for further instructions. Shortly after the Controller asked me if I had visual contact with a helicopter and I reported negative contact. I was still headed away from the airport and did not have them in sight behind me. The Controller told me to turn in and the remainder of the approach to landing was completed without incident.I don't recall anyone in the pattern being asked to visually identify other aircraft prior to my conflict with the other aircraft on final. The traffic I believed I was following was issued a landing clearing shortly before I turned on to base. I suspect the third aircraft in the sequence turned in before I did from the opposing base. For my own part; I was definitely concerned with the amount of traffic in the pattern as it was far beyond what I had experienced in the 18 months prior while flying at this airport. I also had a youthful passenger as a part of the [event]. I have flown this type of mission previously and I didn't feel particularly stressed about that piece; but it is unusual for me to fly with a passenger. I was well rested and ready for this flight. I also felt like I had a good idea of the sequence I was to follow; but I could be incorrect about specifically being assigned #2. I don't think that is the case; but I acknowledge it's possible.
1933053,I was conducting a flight instruction flight with [a student]. It was [students] first flight and this was considered a discovery flight. We had gone around the west side of ZZZ1 past ZZZ2 and were headed back to ZZZ3. [Student] was flying at this time as I was trying to let him fly as much he could handle it. The engine got a little noisier and then seemed quite rough. I immediately took controls and began to fly the aircraft. I was checking the engine instruments and noticed the RPM was dropping but everything else looked fine. At first we only lost a couple hundred RPM. After a few minutes we began losing more and more RPM. This first started over the ZZZ4 near the center of the island of ZZZ1. At this point I turned to set up for a base at ZZZ which was not too far ahead. I immediately contacted ZZZ Tower and told them I would be landing on their airfield. This was a military airfield. They cleared me to land at first. I was slowly losing altitude and more and more RPM as I approached ZZZ. When I turned final at ZZZ I got a little boost in RPM. At this time ZZZ also said that I could not land at a military airfield unless it was a priority and there would be lots of paperwork. I at that point [requested priority handling] and said I would try to maintain altitude to see if it was getting better. However; the engine sputtered again and I told ZZZ that I would be landing. I was a little high so I circled at the approach end and landed the plane. I believe I did the right thing in this situation. Something that I could have improved on was maintaining best; glide speed. However; the engine still had some power. I also probably should have put the plane down and not tried to delay the inevitable when I got the boost of RPM. Even if the plane began to fly normally after that; I would still be landing at ZZZ because of the previous occurrences. I also think that being at 2500 ft. Helped me in this case. If I were even at 2000 ft. I might not have made the runway at ZZZ. Also; I was previously in the military so the military airfield was not that intimidating to me. However; the way ZZZ mentioned on short final that there would be lots of paperwork may have scared some people. So I like to tell people to not be intimidated by military airfields and that an airfield should always be the first option in engine failure.
1888647,Refused aircraft due to four logbook entries in previous five days for Pack Reg Fault. System was reset and signed off twice as good to go; faulted again and was placed on MEL and cleared; faulted again and was cleared via part replacement. Maintenance Control stated wrong part was most likely replaced. Fault was present when I arrived at aircraft (after part was replaced). Maintenance Tech reset system; fault occurred again. Maintenance Supervisor wanted to MEL system again. Strongly suggest company comply with the spirit and intent of the MEL program and stop using it as a way to simply ensure on time performance and completion factor.
1914921,On descent into LAX we were on the Ironman arrival and had the RNAV RNP Z 24R approach loaded into the FMS. We anticipated connecting DAHJR on the approach/arrival together as we had done nearly every time during the previous flights into LAX during this trip. ATC advised us that they were too busy to accommodate the RNAV and told us to expect the visual approach. On downwind they told us to descend to 2;600 at 210kts which we did and extended flaps to 1. While still at a relatively high altitude; approach told us to turn base. At this point the CA (PF) selected 200kts manual speed and called for flaps 2 and continued descending in Vertical Navigation Mode and Flight Level Change (VFLC). We could see the airport and knew we were high so he verbalized that he would square off his base turn to give us more time to descend. Right after that; approach gave us a turn to final which cancelled that plan we had made. At this point we were still too high and I was thinking we would probably end up going around. The Captain (CA) called for the gear down and additional flaps. I know he was using spoilers but I don't remember when or how much they were used. The Visual Glide Path (VGP) was still well below us so the CA disconnected the autopilot and manually pitched down to catch it. At this point the VSI increased as he focused on getting the glideslope. The RAD ALT called out 2500 feet and I assumed he would start to arrest his descent but he did not do so quickly enough. I remember at 1700 feet AGL seeing -2100FPM. I tried to think of what to say that would convey the issue I was seeing and all I could think to say was 'sink rate' and he acknowledged but I don't think he fully understood me or the situation. ATC also called us to warn us of a 'Low altitude alert' which I think was caused by the excessive descent rate. The CA had the spoilers stowed by 1200 feet and we were on glideslope at this point. I believe the rest of the approach was within the stabilized approach criteria after this point.
1909098,While conducting a flight review in VFR conditions; we departed Runway 30 at SMQ to remain in the traffic pattern.  After making a CTAF call; we entered the left downwind for Runway 30.  An ADS-B alert on my iPad alerted to traffic at our same altitude off our right wing just as we rolled out in the downwind.  I immediately took the controls to raise the right wing only to see another small aircraft intercepting our flight path at our altitude.  I immediately made the decision to make a steep left hand turn to avoid a potential collision.  After the turn to avoid was made it was noted that the same aircraft made a turn to follow; so we made another steep turn to evade the aircraft.This aircraft was not entering the traffic pattern but rather crossing mid field of the airport at pattern altitude.  ADS-B shows this aircraft proceeding to a different airport 20 miles north.  The other aircraft gave no indication that they had seen our aircraft at any time during the incident nor were they communicating on the CTAF frequency.
1870312,On departure on the SLEEK 2 RNAV Departure approximately at 7;000 feet turning toward KIDNG intersection lost GPS-L and then GPS-R momentarily.  Not sure what had caused it (maybe 5G).  Denver Departure was asking several questions to other aircraft about the loss of GPS.  After a few seconds GPS was functioning appropriately without any issues on the flight to ZZZ1.
1873158,We were set to execute the ILS 28C which is what the ATIS was reporting. After contacting Chicago Approach; they informed us to expect the RNAV (GPS) 27R. We updated the FMS with RNAV 27R and briefed the approach. VOR updating was turned off. While on Radar vectors; we were given Direct Welev to join the Final for 27R. After joining the final; I notice that my LNAV was indicated full left defection. The VNAV was full up defection; which would be normal since we were below the crossing altitude.At this point; I heard ATC questioning the aircraft ahead of us about their tracking. I took a look at [the] First Officer indication and saw no LNAV/VNAV indication. We both were baffled and could not figure it out. While discussing the matter with FO; aircraft ahead of us did a go around. Shortly after that; we did the same and requested the ILS 28C. Rest of the flight was uneventful; ILS 28C was executed with no issues. After further discussion with FO; we determined that we were perfectly setup for the RNAV 27R approach. Not only did the aircraft ahead of us go around; but so did the aircraft behind us. ATC called me to ask what occurred. I told them what is on this report. They were not sure as to the problem with this approach. ATC controller asked if I thought this was related to 5G. I told him that I did not know.
1896867,Aural alerts and RAAS system alerts are way; way; way too loud! Today; I missed at least five ATC radio calls/clearances due to the extremely loud aural alerts in the Max cockpit. This is a major safety of flight issue with ALL Max 737s. Not only are the alerts interfering with ATC and crew communications but they are also very startling at times.
1883714,Upon arriving at the aircraft; the Captain and myself reviewed the logbook. Upon review; we found a previously written up ELAC fault; and a failure of an elevator servojack. Both of these write ups had been cleared. We noted that the write up of the elevator servojack indicated that the aircraft had reverted into Alternate Law. During our cockpit preparations; a Flight Control Class II message appeared; was written up; and placed on MEL.While en route; during the course of my normal instrument scan; I noticed that an ECAM had appeared for F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; indicating a fault of the Yellow elevator servojack. I should note that the aircraft did not provide any auditory warnings that this ECAM had occurred; leading us to believe that the FWC (Flight Warning Computer) may have failed also.We performed the ECAM actions and reviewed the QRH. This caused us to discuss the fact that this ECAM had been previously written up. We cleared the ECAM item; and shortly thereafter; we saw another ECAM appear.This was the same ECAM of F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; but now the Green elevator servojack was implicated by the fault. As such; we had now lost half the servojacks on the elevator.At this point; we discussed among ourselves the possibility of the aircraft reverting into alternate law; as this had happened to a previous crew in the previous 2 days. As such; we reviewed the alternate law QRH; and setup the aircraft to land flaps 3 in case we experienced a reversion into alternate law later in the flight. We reviewed the landing distance requirements; and after discussing the issue with Maintenance Control and Dispatch via SATCOM; determined we had the requisite landing distance to continue to ZZZ.No further failures occurred; and we landed without incident. Upon arrival; the Captain wrote up both the servojack failures and the FWC not provided any auditory indications of an ECAM.We briefly discussed the failures with a mechanic; and the crew that was taking over the aircraft.At this point; we proceeded to our next aircraft in order to continue our trip. While we were pushing back; we realized that the aircraft we had written up was also pushing back. This leads me to believe the failed system were simply reset and the aircraft returned to service without troubleshooting.
1932726,I was the Pilot Flying (PF) and my First officer (FO) Pilot Monitoring (PM). We were about to start our ZZZZZ arrival over ZZZ1. During our cruise systems check; we discovered the oil quantity indication on the ENG2 appeared to be lower than usual. ENG1;16 qt. ENG2; 6.5 qt. I decided to contact Dispatch for a Maintenance Control consultation. This communication with Dispatch was through SATCOM with a few failed attempts at least twice since we got the failure messages on the FMGC and the call dropping or a weak voice from the Dispatcher. I also tried through ZZZ1 Dispatch VHF XXX.X. When I did this; I accidentally tune the frequency on VHF 1 out from ZZZ Center; but flipped the ZZZ frequency back to it.When we finally got hold Maintenance Control through SATCOM; at that time the oil quantity was at 5.5 on ENG2. I explained our situation and concern with Maintenance Control and a possible engine leak and the trend of oil quantity; recommending to divert to ZZZ1 for a precautionary landing. At that present moment we had an ECAM advisory caution for ENG2 oil qty; 5 qt. Since Maintenance Control concurred with our plan for diverting to ZZZ1 we informed to ATC and continued our descent to divert. Another consideration to this decision was the marginal weather at ZZZ2; with light rain and low ceilings with a front coming into the area. The weather at ZZZ1 was VFR. The inflight and customers were briefed for the divert due to oil engine indication. We were vectored around for our sequence into ZZZ1; RNAV XXL. At this time; a priority was not declared yet.As we continued our descent at low power setting; the oil quantity ECAM advisory for ENG2 was still present and decreasing; 4.5qt. At that time; [priority handling was requested] and the inflight were briefed for a code yellow. We started the APU for systems redundancy. Once we were approximately 15 miles final and cleared for the RNAV XXL approach; our oil quantity for ENG2 was as low as 2qt at leveled off and temperature rising; I believe it was 138 C and increasing; if I remember correctly. It was evident; this was an oil engine leak and not an indication issue. Concerned about an engine damage and having an ECAM warning during short final a busy phase of flight; we performed a precautionary engine 2 shutdown; thrust lever 2 idle and engine master 2 off followed by completing the ECAM actions procedures. We continued the approach and the landing was uneventful. Once cleared of the runway; we briefly stopped at the taxiway for fire and rescue staff inspect the engine 2; if there was any visible damage. They discovered no damage but an apparent minor oil leak from the bottom of the engine. It took only a few minutes to asses this situation before we taxied to the gate. Upon arrival; we met with tech ops and gave them details of our situation. They commented that it was good we salvaged the engine; the oil leak was quite visible and evident once the cowlings were open. Finalizing my narrative; in spite of the circumstances; a rapid decreasing oil quantity on ENG2; [First Officer] and I did our best on bringing the airplane safely on the ground at ZZZ1 where the weather was favorable. It was an overwhelming situation trying to get hold of Dispatch or maintenance at the beginning due to the SATCOM connection issue and the time constraint. But at the end everything was accomplished safe and professional.However; in retrospect. I was really concentrated on getting the aircraft on the ground quickly once [priority handling was requested]. I would have emphasize on a potential precautionary engine shutdown during the approach briefing. It seemed that even though that my FO and I had a continuous dialogue and talking out aloud as we were descending to ZZZ1 we saw ourselves making a last minute decision for a precautionary engine shutdown. Perhaps doing the engine shutdown earlier would have gotten more time to review the contingencies for the flight. In-spite of how comfortable I feel flying the A320 this was a definitely a learning experience for me to manage my time accordingly.
1894326,Experienced a fumes event (dirty sock smell) on decent into ZZZ. Ran the Odor Recognition and Isolation Guidance checklist.
1911945,Student pilot practicing touch and go approaches at ZZZ. Clear day. Initial ATIS wind 070@4. Directed by ATC to use Runway XXL; left pattern. Two touch and goes; and one go-around prior to the event. I was specifically working on energy management on landing; as I had been finding myself routinely high and fast; leading to extended time over runway to bleed off excess energy. The go-around prior to the incident approach was due to being too high on approach. One factor of note is that the north runway at ZZZ is comparatively short; and given the specific skill I was practicing; I was very mindful of needing to get back in the air quickly or have low threshold for go-around. On final circuit leading to event; ATC was managing an incoming helicopter approach and extended my downwind. When turn to base was approved; I completed turn to base and started a descent. Turned to long final and on a good glideslope. There were some notable updrafts that left me again high; so reduced power; added full flaps; and was back to a stable but steeper glideslope. I noted that tower had informed incoming helicopter that current winds were 050@9kts. Landing was unremarkable. Crossed threshold at approximately 60kts and had fairly smooth landing in first stage of runway though slightly left of centerline. At this point I re-applied full power and glanced down to the flap handle to raise flaps. Felt plane start veering to the left. I was already applying right rudder crosswind correction; and additional rudder due to being left of centerline. I do not specifically remember applying further correction for power but this is fairly automatic; and definitely added more correction when aircraft started veering left. I do not precisely recall subsequent events; but the aircraft continued to veer to the left and began skidding; leaving the left side of the runway in a right skid. I pulled back power at some point. Aircraft continued past the grass area and ultimately came to rest in a ditch along the runway. I had minor injuries (couple of abrasions). I am not certain of the extent of aircraft damage at this point; but I do know that the nose wheel was sheered off and the propeller hit the dirt. Reviewed the case in my mind and with CFI; and I was also able to get information from the state troopers who investigated the scene. My perception was that a gust was lifting my left wind and the aircraft was turning into the wind; but that additional rudder input and crosswind correction was not correcting. The wheel skid evidence actually showed heavy loading on the left main; indicating that the wing was not being lifted and actually probably pushed down by crosswind correction.In reviewing with CFI; I believe the following factors contributed to the event.1) I applied power very quickly after landing and more rapidly than I generally apply power. This was driven by a pre-set perception of short runway and need to get speed to take off; but may have lead to a mismatch in p-factor correction vs power application. 2) Due to the flaps still being down when power was applied; I likely unloaded the landing gear; reducing effectiveness of the nose wheel in helping to correct for the leftward turn.3) There are buildings (and the helicopter pad) to the immediate north-east of the runway. Given wind direction; it is likely that the first part of the runway had stable winds; but the later part of the runway had more abnormal gusts and eddies caused by wind at the time flowing over those structures. I feel it is likely that a gust effect in combination with p-factor effect and further exacerbated by full flaps being down and catching the gusts contributed to the rapid left turning force on the aircraft; while power application unloading the wheels reduced the ability to correct for this.4) As a final point; I was specifically focusing on the quality of my landings. While I had mentally briefed the relative shortness of the runway; effect of temperature (hotday) on aircraft performance; and consideration for need to make an early abort / go-around decision; I was ultimately thinking about the landing; not the subsequent take off; which I think impacted my response time and speed to the event.Potential corrective actions:1) Personally: this is a very important lesson in making slow changes to aircraft state; not feeling rushed and always being willing to just abort a take off. Also the importance of order of operations. While the flaps would have taken a moment to come up; the relative loss of lift and loading of the gear may have allowed for better control.2) Environmentally; the ditch along the runway halted the aircraft; but without this ditch running along the runway; this event would likely have been a runway excursion into the grass but with very little actual damage to the aircraft. Consideration of space around runways particularly around facilities that have significant training traffic with inexperienced pilots who are more likely to make errors may be a useful consideration.
1906020,We were number one for a pattern approach to Runway XX at ZZZ. Incident occurred in the left downwind leg of Runway XX. Aircraft Y was observed on ADS-B on a left downwind leg behind us and about 3 NM from the field. The pilot called a base turn for Runway XX while we were still descending in the downwind. We noticed the plane making a turn towards the field on a direct course to collide with us. I made a call on the CTAF asking if the pilot had Aircraft X in front of them in sight. Pilot failed to respond and continued on the course to collide with us. My student had to execute a go around while still in the downwind and climb out of the traffic pattern to avoid collision. The pilot of the other plane was not utilizing see-and-avoid techniques and compromised safety of flight as a result.
1919011,Approach to ZZZ last minute changed from Runway XX to the ZZZZZ Visual to Runway XYR. A vector heading was given to join a left downwind with the terrain and the airport in visual contact at all times VMC conditions. On joining the downwind while descending and configuring for landing with the terrain clearly visible off the right of the aircraft a caution alert 'terrain /terrain' was annunciated. This was a momentary alert as the rising ridge on the downwind was well off the horizontal plane of the aircraft and was cleared in seconds. More vigilance should have been given to closure rate while descending in this environment so as not to activate mode 2 GPWS.
1907295,Prior to boarding guests for the flight; Name1 informed me that there was 6 large duffel bags that was to be brought on board the cabin by 6 Company guests. (These duffel bags and it's contents were originally placed in the cargo hold but Name2 noticed them since he was working the cargo bay with Company loading cargo.) The duffel bags were to be escorted and monitored by 1 guest each. The guests' escorts and duffel bags were placed and seated in Cabin Zone A. Each duffel bag carried approximately 6-8 lithium ion batteries the size of a laptop battery. Name1 advised that they were packaged fairly well to ensure there was no thermal runways or short circuits that could happen inflight. Apparently each battery pack was packed separately; and was contained separately by its own protective cases with the charges being tape down etc. to prevent thermal. Captain Name advised to monitor the duffle bags at all times throughout the flight. Duffle bags could not fit in overhead bins or underneath the seat due to its size. Each bag was placed (1) per middle seat; of each of middle rows; perspectively Rows #1-6 and tied down in the middle seat with multiple seat belt extensions as needed. The concern to this is the amount of [Containment Bags] available in the cabin that would be needed if in event that there was to be a cause of fire especially if more than one of these duffle bags were to have a thermal runway or short circuits of the batteries it carries. The handling of one of these duffel bags was also a concern due to its size and its weight. Unfortunately I was unable and it was unforeseen for me to take a picture or a video of the duffel bags as needed so that this can be further given a true and correct measurement/point of reference. Name1 did asked myself and Captain Name beforehand if it was alright to bring these duffel bags in the cabin for the flight. I referred to the FAM-Hazmat; Chapter 14; 14.5.6 ; 14;5.7; and 14.5.11. And yes I agreed to it; so as Name at the time. We both agreed to it. At the time Name1 did advise that it should be safe; for Company assured him that the batteries were safely and protectively packaged more than usual that is why the duffel bags were huge in size. In regards to the [Containment Bags] amount onboard; please note for Aircraft X there is only 1 [Type 1] / 1 [Type2] at L1 and 1 [Type1] / 1 [Type2] at R4. There are no additional or extras on board even with the Onboard MX (Maintenance)'s supplies. Post flight; Captain Name did bring it up for he was concern; and he spoke to Name1 further more how the batteries were packaged; etc.
1900320,During the top of descent and after the sterile cockpit light was turned ON; i completed the pre-landing compliance check then I sat on my jump seat. Then I received a call from the pilot informing me about having an issue with one of the flaps that stayed flat. The explained to me that they will be following the procedure and it will not cause an emergency; I have to be prepared for a very fast and speedy landing. They said it will look out of normal landing yet it will not be a major issue; however be prepared for any sudden changes. Then I made another announcement in the cabin sharing that we will be expecting a fast and speedy landing according to the Captain and emphasised the importance of keeping their seat belts fastened. Then the Captain made an announcement as well explained in details the technical issue and assured the passengers that everything will be according the procedures and it will not have a negative impact except that the landing will be expected to me fast. After 5 minutes a received an emergency call from the flight deck informing me that we will be touching down in 8 minutes and be prepared. I went through the emergency drill in my head while going through my 60 seconds review. The landing was smooth and there was no sudden or strong impact while the aircraft touched the runway; it was only fast while it was on the ground. Passengers were not affected. There was no shock or sudden agitation in the cabin. During disembarkation; the passengers were smiling and thanked us without showing any concerns or even noticing difference.
1928405,Nose wheel collapsed on hard landing.
1896825,Taxied into gate with guidance of two Wing Walkers and Marshaler. Captain and I noticed two trucks parked next to each other behind the Safety Zone line on the right side. We discussed proximity of trucks and agreed to continue since Wing Walker was in place and was indicating clearance to Marshaler. While on the final lead-in line; an abnormal vibration was felt. Captain stopped the aircraft immediately and I looked out to see that contact had been made with a truck. Light rain was falling at the time of the incident and the ramp was wet.
1895766,After a lengthy wheels up delay we took off on [Runway] XXR and shortly after Takeoff; during climb out phase of flight; (approximately 1;000 ft. MSL) I lost my Primary Flight Instruments/Displays; followed by the failure of all Displays in the cockpit with numerous EICAS cautions prior to EICAS display failure. The First Officer was changing frequencies and making a radio call with ATC when the initial failure happened; but within a few seconds all displays flickered on and then all failed again. I continued to fly using standby instruments until the R GEN eventually carried the electrical load and some of the failures where cleared; but load shedding disabled several items; including as expected; R ELEC HYD pump; UTIL BUSES; etc... When I spoke to the FAs (Flight Attendants) on the initial contact with them while we were initiating the return to ZZZ1; they also confirmed they had lost power in the cabin/galleys. When partial electrical power was established I noticed the L GEN OFF was the only switch that was not a load shed item amongst all the other illuminated lights. At some point early on during the failures we started the APU and the FO (First Officer) ran the L GEN OFF QRH. Once the APU came on line; everything somewhat returned to normal with the exception of the L GEN OFF EICAS. Running the QRH failed to reset the L GEN failure. After checklist completion down to deferred items; I transferred control of the aircraft to the FO and began coordinating with ZZZ1 Station Operations and Maintenance; Dispatch and Maintenance Control; while the FO flew and coordinated with ATC for the return to ZZZ1. We coordinated with ZZZ1 Maintenance about an overweight landing and what that involved with the overweight landing inspection and were assured they could handle that; at which time we elected to return to ZZZ1; versus burning off approximately 2 hours of the 6 hours of fuel we had. We did not [request priority handling]; but initially with all the failures; we anticipated we would and I believe I passed that along to Dispatch; however we never officially declared with ATC. We did inform ATC of our situation; souls on board and fuel remaining and they vectored us out over the [ocean] to get set up for a straight in to the south complex; [Runway] XYL or [Runway] XYR. Initially they wanted us to land on [Runway] XXL; but we requested the south complex and longer runways. We set up for XYR and they gave us XYL; but we requested XYR to avoid another runway change; and subsequently that paid dividends when another Airline closed XYL with a disabled aircraft while we were on final for XYR. I advised the FAs of our issues early on and that we were probably returning the ZZZ1 and subsequently ran [checklist] with them to let them know we were actually returning to ZZZ1. I made a few PAs for the Passengers; assuring them there was no cause for alarm for our return to ZZZ1 and that we were coordinating for another aircraft to take them to ZZZ. Planned and performed an ILS to XYR; transitioned to a Visual (G/S was unreliable); Flaps 30 landing (139 Ref / 145 Target) which was surprisingly smooth and uneventful; including rollout and braking; using maximum reverse thrust. Overweight landing was 213;000 lbs.; 15;000 lbs. over maximum. All brake temps were 2 or less after the flight. Flight/Weather conditions were VMC with haze/smog restricting visibility but not significantly adversely affecting VFR operations. We debriefed Maintenance with all indications we experienced with the electrical failures. Indicated that it seemed to be 15 seconds before the R GEN took the full electrical load with associated load shedding. Also; noted that time compression associated with stress situations during this event might actually reveal the event was less than 15 seconds of electrical failure while flying on standby instruments. We were met and individually evaluated for fitness of duty to continue by ZZZ1 Personnel; debriefed with ZZZ [Personnel] andelected to continue with another aircraft later in the day to ZZZ.
1928742,Ramp informed us we had RADIO-PHARMA loaded on the aircraft a few minutes prior to push in ZZZ. The Captain reviewed the NOTOC; signed both copies and we pushed off the Gate. Upon reaching cruising altitude; I reviewed the NOTOC and realized that we did not amend the Dispatch Release prior to departure to add the Hazmat to the remarks section of the Release. The Captain sent a ACARS message to the Dispatcher and we amended the Release electronically.
1920632,Local Controller training. Trainee is a former Center Controller CPC now training at Tower; currently with 50% of his base hours for the position. Trainee has a hard time with the position and decision making. I was his instructor for the morning. Local Control trainee clears Aircraft X for takeoff 18L; then line up and wait Aircraft Y and tells them traffic will be crossing downfield. Local Control trainee crosses Aircraft Z at A; crosses another aircraft at 18R and Taxiway Zulu (No Factor) and then tries to cross a second aircraft at 18L while Aircraft X is rolling. Instructor steps in and cancels the second aircraft but did not catch the first one in time. Aircraft X rejects takeoff. As the instructor I take and accept full responsibility for the position. The trainee needs to make better use of memory aids. The responsibility is mine. The trainee made multiple decisions and I failed to keep up.
1908806,On landing directly after touchdown a deer ran onto the runway directly at my airplane and struck the plane; and went under the wing and the main gear ran over him. There was very little damage but my mechanic is checking it; lots of blood and deer parts.
1869869,First Officer spotted a white medium sized drone within a couple hundred feet to the right side of aircraft at 700 feet and [on a] two mile final [to] Runway 22L EWR. Continued normal approach and landing. Reported to ATC; Dispatch; Chief Pilot; and Airport Authority.
1934170,Departed Runway XX and a King Air was on final for Runway YY; saw the aircraft on ADS-B in and deviated right to maintain separation.
1868802,We were working [a flight] to ZZZ1 there was a spill of a red unknown liquid inside pit 4. Someone called Maintenance to see if they could identify what kind of liquid. Maintenance could not identify what kind a liquid and they refused to clean it. Then the Supervisor gave us the order to clean it and we (the crew working the flight) refused to do it because we did not know what type of liquid it was
1870193,Lost both GPS;and both transponders on approach to Denver. Heard four other aircraft have exact same issue. Also had terr pos [warning] on approach. Systems returned on landing.
1911129,During takeoff roll; lost CA (Captain) and FO (First Officer) airspeed indications. Standby airspeed indicated properly. Once airborne; ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) messages indicated that the aircraft was in alternate law and had no autopilot or auto thrust. CA and FO had no flight directors. Upon flap retraction; flaps jammed (leading edge slats failed to retract). ECAM displayed use manual pitch trim. Unable to manually trim aircraft pitch. Aircraft was nose-heavy. Required continuous aft stick pressure to maintain level flight. Believe maximum flap/slat speed exceeded. [Requested priority handling]. Returned to ZZZ. Able to configure aircraft to flaps 3. Upon gear extension; regained normal pitch authority. Uneventful landing and rollout. After clearing the runway; flaps retracted normally. Aircraft logbook indicated that the #3 pitot tube had been replaced due to being clogged. The logbook also indicated the aircraft had a hard landing on the previous flight. Multiple system failures. I do not know the cause of the system failures and therefore do not have any suggestions on how to prevent this from happening again. Previous simulator training with simulated systems failures was definitely helpful in this situation.
1884454,Flying ILS 9C. At 4000 I noticed the GS signal moving abnormally fast from full up deflection to downward as we intercepted the GS. The movement was so fast the GS captured quickly and the aircraft pitched 5 degrees nose down (AP was on). The FO (First Officer) disconnected the AP but initially continued to follow the FD until I commanded him to pitch up and recover. Once stabilized flight was regained; I noticed an aircraft taxi south across the approach end of the runway on Taxiway Z. We both attributed the erratic GS to this aircraft. Once the aircraft cleared the runway; the signal appeared normal. We continued the approach in VMC. Approximately 2 miles from EZELL; I noticed we were approximately 2200 ft. MSL which is 200 ft. lower than we should have been when on the GS. I attempted to determine what was wrong and visually confirmed we were low by looking at the PAPIs. When we passed EZELL; I noticed we were only 1350 ft. AGL (200-300 lower than we should have been on the GS). I verbalized this to the FO who seemed distracted with the obvious irregularity. We extended the gear and flaps and were fully configured by 1000 ft. The FO disregarded the GS and flew the remaining approach visually. I again noticed another aircraft holding short of [Runway] 9C on Z Taxiway which I assumed caused the GS error. I reported this to ATC which seemed unconcerned and mentioned that an aircraft had not stopped in the correct location. Shortly after; another aircraft; who had heard our transmission; advised ATC that they experienced the same issue. Clearly this is a very unsafe situation and could have numerous consequences. In IMC; we would have gone around. It also may have resulted in a CFIT escape.
1897631,I was assigned Aircraft X that had been here for the weekend. I reviewed the log book back to the day the aircraft arrived. I noted that gear pin installation had been written up and the corrective action of removing the gear pins had been signed off. Once arriving at the aircraft I walked around it before beginning my assigned tasks and did not see any gear pins. Before departure time the Captain performed his preflight inspection and he did not see the gear pins. At departure time my partner completed a final walk around while I watched from the nose gear area and he did not see the gear pins. After the aircraft did an air turn back we discovered pins installed in the forward holes of the left and right main landing gear. I can only assume the streamers had been wrapped around the gear links due to the windy conditions we had been experiencing; therefore none of us saw the streamers hanging.
1900711,Approximately crossing the final approach fix on the RNAV Y Runway XY approach; with the runway in sight I disconnected the autopilot and proceeded to hand-fly a visual approach to Runway XY. As we descended on the approach we experienced continuous light turbulence and lateral wind-shear which occasionally required more than half-deflection of the ailerons to maintain straight flight. While I had appropriate control deflection to the right; I did not have adequate deflection to the left; something was blocking the control wheel from being rotated more than approximately half-way to the left. I tried several times to move the control wheel more than half-way to the left but could not. Knowing the wind at the surface was calm; and as we descended the wind-shear began to decrease; I elected to continue the landing as I believed that to be the safest course of action.
1925160,"Departing from ZZZ; I was pilot monitoring and we were doing a flaps 4 departure. It was a normal takeoff with gear being put up and NAV called at 400 ft. At 1;000 RA; my FO (First Officer) announced VNAV. We climbed a couple hundred ft. and during this time; the Flight Director and AT (Autothrottle) gave us some very strange commands. The throttles should have been giving us full power. However; they had reduced back and were only giving us 50 to 65% power; and the Flight Director was telling us to go down in an attempt to speed up. We were of course at 1600 to 1700 ft. and roughly 140 kt. We received a Don't Sink"" message as well. At this point; I took over the controls from my FO and overrode the AT in an attempt to feel what they were doing; and they were attempting to return to the previous lower throttle setting. I disconnected them and advanced them to full power and disregarded the Flight Director information. I proceeded through our normal flap retraction schedule.We alerted the controller to our situation and let them know that we wanted to return to the field. They had us level at 4;000 ft.; and we planned to return to ZZZ. They also asked if we would like to [request priority handling]; to which I said no. I disconnected all the automation and the Flight Director and got my bearings straight while responding [to] the controller's vectors. At some point; we decided it better to divert to ZZZ1; so we began building; bugging; and briefing for that. I contacted Dispatch and kept them in the loop; and also made a PA to the passengers and let them know as best as I could what was happening. Ultimately; in the simplest form; I would say the automation was giving us commands that we knew that we didn't want to do. When we input the landing data; we learned that we would be overweight for landing and that we needed to fly around to burn off fuel. I decided that the return was not pressing enough to do an overweight landing. My FO was having some difficultly setting up the MCDU (Multipurpose Control Display Unit) and since I couldn't help him as I was hand-flying; I turned the automation back on to see if it would work. It appeared to work; and satisfied with that; I began helping with the setup of the approach. To give myself more latitude and leeway; I decided it would be best to [request priority handling] for a ""just in case"" scenario. Dispatch then informed us that emergency vehicles would be meeting us at the plane; to which I said that would not be necessary. I asked the controller about this and they said it was standard [priority handling] protocol. The reason I didn't want the vehicles was because I didn't want to panic the passengers. I called the flight attendants at some point and asked how they were doing; informed them that no brace would be necessary; and that it would be a normal landing.Just to cover all bases here I did consider the possibility of trying to replicate the malfunction by doing some maneuvers; but ultimately decided against it as my primary concern was the wellbeing of the passengers. We burned off the necessary fuel and came in for a normal landing. The emergency vehicles did a once over; and then we proceeded to the gate. This report is being filed for a just in case scenario. I really do think that I maneuvered through this situation in a very good manner; in that I followed what I've been trained to do via not being overly reliant on the automation and overriding it when necessary; as well as keeping everyone in the loop who needed to know. I attest my performance to the excellent training that I received over the years. While I can't think of any really specific; as I've indicated to anyone that's called me so far; I'm very willing to hear any suggestions that can help me navigate through future events; small and large."""
1893440,During approach; upon gear extension; we received WHEEL N/W STRG FAULT. We coordinated with Tower for go-around instructions and went around. After performing the go-around and switching to departure we conducted the non-normal per SOP and entered a hold over ZZZZZ. We advised departure of our nose wheel steering fault and coordinated with them to have a tug relocate to the runway. ATC requested priority handling on our behalf and crash and fire rescue also met us after landing. We sent an ACARS to Dispatch; made multiple PAs for the passengers and advised inflight. ATC vectored us back in line for a second approach. We advised the Tower once again of our issue and; after landing; we cleared on FR and stopped clear of Runway XXL. Crash and fire rescue evaluated the aircraft and found no issues. Once the tug was hooked up we were towed to gate. After block in we entered the discrepancy into the logbook and called Dispatch to clarify the event with them.
1907700,I was CA and PF on the next-to-last leg of a four day sequence. ZZZ is a Special Qualification Airport; due to mountainous terrain and complex procedures; requiring pilot review of the company ops advisory pages and Jeppesen color qualification pages in Jeppesen FD-Pro prior to operations there. The FO/PM had flown into this airport numerous times at a previous carrier prior to joining our company; so is very familiar with the local terrain and procedures. This was my first time flying there; however.Enroute to ZZZ; I reviewed the ops advisory pages and the color qualification pages; and we discussed the ILS Rwy XX approach planned based upon the prevailing winds at the time; along with the company engine failure missed approach procedures for that runway. Once in radio range of ZZZ; the FO/PM obtained the ATIS; which reflected a new weather observation that included a wind shift and runway change to runway YY. I then adjusted the FMS to reflect the ILS Rwy YY approach and we discussed the new approach. The FO warned me that their previous carrier had had a terrain warning event on this approach; where pilots that were cleared for the approach had immediately set the FAF altitude at ZZZZZ [Intersection] of 3;800 MSL and begun a descent to that altitude prior to capturing the glide slope; failing to honor the stepdown altitudes of 5500 ft. at ZZZZZ1 [Intersection] and 4800 ft. at ZZZZZ2 [Intersection]. As a result; this approach became a regular focus during their recurrent simulator training. I noted that the approach does not allow autopilot coupled approaches; a constraint I have not seen before; and said that I would hand fly the approach and use manual thrust for proficiency which I try to do at least once on every sequence. The FO/PM suggested we could fly the GPS approach that allows coupled approaches; but I did not consider that to be necessary. In hindsight; that would have been a better choice than the ILS.I failed to recognize the threat the FO was warning me of; which is especially salient in the Airbus; that once the localizer is captured the aircraft will NOT honor FMS (NAV) altitude constraints. My plan was to not arm approach until inside of ZZZZZ2 [Intersection]; and instead use a managed descent; allowing the FMS to ensure the ZZZZZ1 [Intersection] and ZZZZZ2 [Intersection] constraints were met. I then failed to properly monitor the aircraft to ensure it did what I intended.  Once we were cleared to intercept the localizer and it captured; I set the ZZZZZ [Intersection] FAF altitude of 3800 ft.; and managed the descent; while we were still outside of ZZZZZ1 [Intersection]. I had forgotten that; once in localizer track mode; NAV altitude constraints will not be honored. The aircraft was slow and smooth to start the managed descent; and I didn't recognize that it had started descending. The FO/PM did; however; and warned me. As I recall; I then mentioned my intent to have the FMS control the descents to avoid being below the ZZZZZ1 [Intersection] and ZZZZZ [Intersection] fix altitudes in case the glide slope did not honor them. The glide slope feather does not extend beyond the FAF on this approach; indicating it is not certified beyond the FAF. The FO immediately pressed ALT HOLD and pointed out we were below the required altitude at ZZZZZ1 [Intersection]. Reviewing the incident; we passed ZZZZZ1 [Intersection] at 5325 ft.; 175 ft. below the minimum of 5500 ft. We passed abeam the highest peak on the approach plate and very close to the final approach course at 5125 ft. (minimum altitude at that point was 4800 ft.). As I recall; I then armed the approach mode and we captured the glideslope; passing the next fix of ZZZZZ2 [Intersection] at 4875 ft. (minimum altitude of 4800 ft.). I then turned off the autopilot per the approach requirements; and autothrust per my plan. We passed the ZZZZZ [Intersection] FAF at 3850 ft. (minimum altitude and crossing altitude of 3800) and continued to landing.Fundamentally; I failed to properly monitor the aircraft to ensure it actually flew the vertical path I intended; and intervening when it did not. Factors that led me to misconfigure the automation include several approaches commonly flown require stepdown fixes prior to the FAF. However; those approaches are normally flown in NAV; managed descent; until approaching the FAF; when approach is armed. Those set me up with an expectation bias of being able to manage the descent; forgetting that on this approach I was in LOC; not NAV. An earlier design (since reconfigured) of the ZZZ1 ILS ZZ approach was reported to have a number of pilots violated for crossing a fix outside of the FAF below the minimum altitude because they armed approach; captured the GS; and it brought the aircraft to an altitude below the minimum allowed crossing that pre-FAF fix - that made me leery of arming approach prior to the FAF.This is a challenging destination for our Airbus pilots. Include this airport as a focus in recurrent simulator training. Discuss the challenges of the mountainous terrain; coupled with a hand-flown approach; and stepdown fixes prior to the FAF yet outside the GS service volume. Add a photo from the flight deck on a clear day of the terrain ahead when over ZZZZZ1 [Intersection].
1934758,We were doing a functional check flight and while we were performing the takeoff we encountered a significant issue with the nose gear. The Captain and I elected to do a static thrust takeoff to ensure that the engine was performing normally and all systems were okay. After the Captain released the brakes (who was also the Pilot Flying) the aircraft began to accelerate; but violently started to drift right. I was in the process of setting thrust and I noticed the captain applied full left rudder to correct. The airplane continue to drift right in the Captain began aborting the takeoff and took control with the tiller. The aircraft was no faster than 40 kts. and we were able to stop on the runway and get back on center line. Once we evaluated the situation we were able to taxi off without incident. The nose wheel steering via the tiller worked correctly but we were still confused as to why the rudder steering did not work. We asked Tower if we could taxi back to the maintenance building on the runway so that we could minimize turns and had enough stopping distance if we needed to. While performing the taxi back we noticed that when applying right or left rudder the airplane turned in the opposite direction. This was only with the pedals the tiller worked in its correct direction. Once we got back to the hanger the technicians performed diagnostics and confirmed that the nose wheel steering from the pedals was indeed hooked up backwards.It was determined that the facility conducting the heavy maintenance did not connect the nose wheel steering to the rudder pedals correctlyAdd a nose wheel steering via rudder check in the functional check flight checklist.
1881615,Training aircraft in the area made a miscalculated position report and was still in the area when I approached from about 6 miles away. They didn't say anything about sticking around in that area. When I turned over to the Control Tower of the airspace I was about to enter they gave me a traffic advisory; I saw the aircraft immediately and climbed slightly; and made a slight left turn behind them. If no action was taken we would not have collided. The invasive action was just precautionary.
