1920608,"We identified an unsafe and potentially catastrophic condition in the Gulfstream GVII-G500 and Gulfstream GVII-G600 Airplane Flight Manual. We contacted the Original Equipment Manufacturer Gulfstream to inform them of the unsafe condition, and did not receive qualitative justification, leading to believe the unsafe condition is still present. Gulfstream promotes that the ""Appendix A1: Reduced Thrust (FLEX) Takeoff"", located in the GVII-500 and GVII-G600 Airplane Flight Manual, can be used as an alternative to the Chapter 5 - Performance, to determine allowable takeoff weight from short aircraft. To that effect, Gulfstream has also convinced airport performance providers such as Airport Performance Group (APG) to use this supplement as an alternative to Chapter 5. Customers use those blindly. This could have devastating consequences as a quick examination of the Accelerate-Go and Accelerate-Stop distances in the Chapter 5 will clearly indicate that this method does not appropriately respect necessary basic conditions to allow a safe takeoff. Example: 5,000 ft. runway at 50 ft. elevation, WET runway and 15 degrees Celsius. The Appendix A1 tells the operator the following: At the next higher pressure altitude in the chart (1000 ft because interpolation is not accepted). Takeoff flaps 20. Takeoff weight: 60,000 lb. FLD LENGTH (FT) 4970 (although not clear or explained what this parameter incorporates). V1 KIAS 116. VR KIAS 118. V2 KIAS 133. However, when reporting those parameters in the Chapter 5, at this specific V1 over VR ratio (0.983), an effective runway length of 5,000 ft., we get that the GVII-G500 aircraft would need 4,200 ft. of runway for the Accelerate-go, but would require 6,400 ft. for the Accelerate-stop distance, putting public at great risk if the pilot had to make the decision to stop the aircraft right before V1. This situation is of great concern. The FLD LENGTH parameter in the Appendix A1 does not consider the higher value of the Accelerate-go or accelerate-stop and is therefore NOT conservative. Furthermore, the said supplement does not offer an example on how a pilot would use such a supplement in lieu of using Chapter 5 to calculate performance. All of which poses a great danger to public safety and is an accident waiting to happen."
1916481,"Aircraft X was instructed to cross Runway 19 at L but instead crossed Runway 24 at L, the departure runway with an aircraft, Aircraft Y, already cleared for takeoff and in departure roll. Aircraft Y overflew Aircraft X at approximately 10ft. The taxiway that connects Runway 19 to the Alpha pad should be renamed Taxiway Alpha to avoid confusion. Taxiway alpha should extend from the alpha pad."
1870834,"We were flying ZZZ-ZZZ1. In our descent into ZZZ1 (ZZZZZ Arrival) we were approximately at 17000 feet when I (Captain) opened the speed brakes. As soon as I opened the speed brakes we received a FLAP FAIL message. We immediately performed the QRH procedures and decided the game plan would be to divert to ZZZ2. We notified dispatch, ATC, spoke to the Flight Attendant's and passengers of the situation and game plan. ATC asked us if we wanted to request priority handling, but we told them to deploy Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) just as a precaution so they could check brake temps upon landing. ATC decided to give priority handling for us. Once set up for the approach (ILS XXC-VFR conditions at the airfield) and briefed, we set up for a long straight in final and configured early. We landed without incident and momentarily stopped the aircraft on the Runway. CFR requested we pull off the next Taxiway so we elected to do that. CFR checked all brake temperatures and gave us the ok. We proceeded to our new Gate XX67 and CFR met us at the Gate for one final brake check."
1891681,"I flew behind my house and above the woods with line of sight. Upon flight I was trying different settings on the new drone. I lost control and was disoriented with the direction of flight. I lost connection to the drone multiple times and the return to home function was not set properly and it tried to return to a location that was south of me. A helicopter was in the area. They indicated that I flew within 20 feet of their aircraft but I did not see them. I tried to navigate back to my location and after multiple attempts I was successful. The helicopter followed the drone back to my location and Public Officials confiscated the drone. I do not have access to the video, only the flight logs. The App shows when aircraft are present or close. This never occurred until returning home and the helicopter was circling the house. Not sure if the helicopter was broadcasting or any other traffic was present."
1885604,"We took off on Runway XXR on the ZZZZZ departure. Climbing through 29000 ft., we received AFT COMPT LOOP FAULT. I leveled off at 30000 ft. and we ran the QRH checklist. We then received the CARGO COMPT SMOKE ECAM message and a Master Caution. I took over ATC comm 1 radio and [advised ATC] and requested return to ZZZ. The FO (First Officer) continued the checklist, changed the destination and set us up for a return to Runway XYR at ZZZ. We had an uneventful landing and the fire department used thermal cameras to check for heat signature in the AFT compartment. No indications were seen and we taxied back to the ramp. This is an edited version of my first [report] from this event. I was PF (Pilot Flying). We took off on [Runway] XXR on the ZZZZZ departure. Climbing through 29000 ft.,we had a AFT COMPT LOOP FAULT ECAM message with a Cargo Loop Fault procedure. My FO (First Officer) opened the QRH to the Cargo Loop Fault checklist. After further reflection on our actions during the event and referencing the Systems manual and QRH again, I realized the Cargo Loop Fault checklist does not fully explain how to do a Loop Test. The checklist states, ""Loop Test - Perform"" but does not go into detail on HOW to perform a loop test. The systems manual does, and on step X. Loop Test Pushbutton it states - ""Pressed and held IN"". My FO did not press and hold in the Loop Test button, he only pressed and released it. The next sentence in the QRH Cargo Loop Fault checklist states, ""If SMOKE light does not illuminate for affected compartment (smoke condition exists):"" My FO and I looked at each other and said, ""We must have smoke."" We then continued the checklist by RE-SELECTING LOOP A (which had faulted) and turned OFF the OTHER LOOP. Almost immediately we received the CARGO COMPT SMOKE ECAM Master Warning and chime as the checklist states, Procedure: CARGO COMPT SMOKE. I took over ATC communications 1 radio and [requested priority handling], requested return to ZZZ as the FO continued the checklist, changed the destination and set us up for a return to XYR back at ZZZ. Uneventful landing and the fire department used thermal cameras to check for heat signature in the AFT compartment. No indications were seen and we taxied back to the ramp. If you look at the [Aircraft] System manual, you can see the photo of the Lower Cargo Smoke Detection system and see that by re-selecting a faulted LOOP A, and turning OFF the good LOOP B, you will receive a SMOKE detection, which is what we had. In addition, if you turn the page in the QRH you will see ""Additional Information"" which uses the example of an Illuminated LOOP A fault. This information is very important and a reference to it should be included on page XXX of the QRH. I would recommend a change to the QRH CARGO LOOP FAULT checklist to edit the ""LOOP TEST - PERFORM"" to closely match the Systems manual and should read, ""LOOP TEST - PRESS AND HOLD IN"". ALL lights on the Cargo Compartment Smoke Detection panel should illuminate which will confirm a faulty loop (see second boldfaced sentence). If the SMOKE light does NOT illuminate for affected compartment, smoke condition exists. If you flip the two boldface sentences, the checklist will make more sense after you ""perform a loop test"" by holding the button IN. Since our FO's do not perform a Main Deck or Cargo compartment LOOP test during their preflight, they may not understand you must hold the button in to do the loop test."
1870987,"During the initial climb of flight number service from ZZZ to ZZZ1, we got a BLEED 2 FAIL EICAS msg at FL320 and climbing to FL350, we immediately stopped the climb and I ran the QRH. The message did not go away, but we decided then to continue to ZZZ1 at FL310 in accordance with the QRH. BLEED 2 OVERPRESS appeared 42 min into the flight (maybe 10min after the first EICAS), also persistent, we followed the QRH as well, XBLEED was pushed out for the reminder of the flight and EICAS overpress was gone. The new QRH put a band aid on the plane that lasted about 5 to 10 min. The message came back after that, the QRH thus called to request priority handling and land in nearest suitable airport. The Captain, ATC and myself all agreed on ZZZ2. We executed a descent and ran the QRC for that and landed with no other issues afterwards. The Captain got himself numbers and worked the box, while I was briefing the approach, obtaining the ATIS and talking to ATC. He also took care of the PAs. We did not exceed any limitations, nor did we request priority into the alternate. The rest of the flight was uneventful."
1868552,"I was assigned to fly the freighter ZZZ-ZZZ1. Upon arrival in operations I was notified that the plane wouldn't likely be to the cargo parking area until around XA00, even though we had a XB55 departure time scheduled. When I met the Captain I relayed what I had heard about the arrival time and he offered the idea to taxi the plane from the maintenance hangar to cargo parking. When we arrived at the hanger we were notified it was there because it had previously been involved with a fire in the ground power receptacle area. Reviewing the logbook also indicated the aircraft had been involved with a fire and had multiple repairs done because of the fire, including damage to a pressure vessel seal. I performed a personal assessment of the threats for a roughly 3 hour 45 minute flight to ZZZ1 that we were facing. -Airplane just out of maintenance with no functional check flight. -night flight. -poor weather currently and in the forecast for ZZZ. -poor weather along the route to ZZZ1. -unknown runway conditions along route. -possibly no ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) along the route. -still need reposition from hangar to cargo. -still needed to be loaded with cargo. -needed lots of de-ice. -both pilots only getting more fatigued. -best case scenario, we would depart around XA30 after showing at XC55. I expressed my concerns to the Captain and said I'm of the opinion that the airplane should have a functional check flight prior to it operating again. Also, the fear of if we have a problem, we have almost zero divert options. Captain then called flight operations to consult the concerns and they indicated that the fire was suspected to be caused from the ground power cart cable and indicated that after consulting with Maintenance, it seems safe to proceed with the flight. Reviewing the verbiage of the FOM, it states that a functional check flight is required after major work is performed and Flight Operations or Maintenance can request the flight. We jointly decided that the repairs done should warrant a functional check flight. It was then that the Captain communicated flight operations that we are opting to decline the airplane."
1864976,This report is filed to report a maintenance omission. Aircraft X arrived with an APU keel duct pressure seal missing. The aircraft was taken out of service because of the lengthy time required to correct this issue. This can lead to pressurization leaks/issues. There have been several other aircraft with the same issue.
1864918,"We were on approach to RWY 30 into BZN on the RNAV RNP 30 from Livingston transition. We were getting moderate turbulence with the wind around 600-70 kts below 10,000 [feet]. We had thoroughly briefed the approach prior to the descent. While on the approach around 5,000ft Tower advised us the an aircraft had circled to 30 from ILS 12 and during the approach experienced a 2,000 fpm updraft and moderate turbulence on approach but braking action was good upon landing. Around LAVPE, the Captain called for below the line landing checklist while we were descending on the VPATH. I ran the checklist and then looked at my Jepp Approach Chart to confirm what the missed approach altitude was, it was right after that we got a ""Caution Terrain"" aural warning followed by Tower telling us we had a low altitude warning. We then got another caution terrain warning and the Captain disconnected the AP and started to climb, I saw at that point we were below the VPATH somehow. We started to climb back towards the path and then got the RWY in sight and descended for a normal landing. Some time between me going heads down to run the below the line landing checklist and MOSNE intersection we got low and I still do not know how. We were on AP and VPATH just a few seconds prior, I don't know if we got a downdraft or what but I'm still confused as to how the aircraft got low. We decided to continue to the approach instead of going around and I believe that was the safer of the two options giving the wind gusts and moderate turbulence in mountainous and unfamiliar (for me first time to BZN) terrain. We both had a long day (I commuted in that morning because I missed my last commute the night prior due to operational delays) and had been fighting turbulence all day long on ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ-BZN routes which probably made us more tired than normal. This was my first time into BZN and the low visibility, moderate icing from the snow storm, and moderate (or greater) turbulence on approach made it tougher to concentrate and multi task. I'm not sure how we got below the path on approach as I was Pilot Monitoring and heads down running the checklist so I have no suggestions as of now. I should have done a better job monitoring our descent and VPATH even while conducting the Landing Checklist."
1864751,Me and my student were doing ground reference maneuvers near the town of Name and a rotorcraft was inbound for ZZZ. We made several calls about where we were in relation to the airport and even other aircraft could here us making the calls. The helicopter cut through our approach path and I took the controls from my student and made an abrupt decision to introduce power and climb away from the maneuver because he was descending into us. The rotorcraft then went and cut someone off on final for Runway X at ZZZ. What I feel can be done about this is the pilot needs to be talked too about visual scanning if he would've been scanning for traffic while flying and listening to radio calls this report wouldn't be typed to begin with.
1859056,"While operating Aircraft X we received a ""Cell call"" message on ACARS from our Dispatcher. The message informed us that we were NORDO and that we needed to contact center on Frequency X. In the 5 mins prior the radios were quiet. For the night in particular, we didn't find this to be that unusual because radio chatter had already been sporadic. Guard was tuned on VHF 2, however we turned it down due to unnecessary chatter earlier in the flight. As a procedure, guard should be tuned, and selected in VHF 2 with the volume turned up loud enough to be heard. If radio chatter becomes unnecessary and distracting then guard should be turned down for no longer than 5 minutes. This could alleviate any potential NORDO incidents in the future."
1858937,"Around the last week of Month during our move from the west hangar to our new facility in the east side of the airport many pallets with un-serviceable back hold parts were loaded on trailer trucks without the proper dangerous goods documentation or undeclared, with the final destination of ZZZ1. They were loaded following instructions to do so by our leadership team. We were unaware of the present of Dangerous Goods in many or several of these pallets and were not instructed of the need to provide any Dangerous Goods documentation only to load the pallets onto the trailer trucks. We neither had the system to retrieve any information that would have alert us about the presence of these dangerous goods parts."
1857915,Solo flight in PA18 with wheel skis configured in a wheels down position. Locked brake during landing resulting in propeller contacting the ground. Landing surface snow covered gravel with areas of exposed gravel. Push rod connecting front seat brake pedal to master cylinder was discovered pinned under wheel/ski pump after stopping on the runway. Aircraft was stopped on the runway following the propeller contacting the ground. Front brake pedals were not used during the landing. No additional damage to the aircraft or property. Tower was notified of the aircraft being shutdown on the landing surface and a tow was requested. Aircraft was towed from the landing surface. Locked brake perception was insidious due to slippery surface initially and the drag increased rapidly just prior to prop contact. Mid roll out there were sounds similar to the back of the skis dragging if the pressure drops a little in the wheel ski pump or the skis are not installed properly but I did not process as possible brake lock during the landing. Sound was most likely gravel kicking up and hitting the ski from the locked brake. There was also a light quartering headwind with an approximate 5kt crosswind on the same side as the locked brake to add to the poor perception. The mechanical situation is preventable with adjustment of the ski pump installation to avoid interference with the brake push rod. I also intend to add a visual check of brake rods/cables to my before landing checklist and be more vigilant for unusual sensory perceptions that do not match my expected environment.
1849581,"In short, the Tower Controller created a situation in which I felt I was out of options, and ultimately led to a wake turbulence / jet blast encounter for my student and me. I was providing flight instruction in a Cessna 172 while my student was flying the RNAV 36 at MYR (the student was wearing a view limiting device and I was responsible for looking outside, see & avoid, etc). As we were approximately 3-4 nautical miles out from Runway 36, a Navy Aircraft Y was in the tower pattern for touch-and-goes, and the Tower Controller cleared the Aircraft Y for a short approach in front of us. This was a day with winds aloft from approximately 270, so the Aircraft Y had a tail wind on the base leg. The Aircraft Y's short approach was still a rather wide base, and it appeared to be in a steady descending turn straight toward us at approximately the same altitude as us. I asked Tower if the Aircraft Y was turning towards us; Tower acknowledged they were making a short approach ahead of us; I responded that the angle looked a little close; Tower issued the Aircraft Y a traffic advisory to look for us on a 3-mile final, to which the Aircraft Y responded they had us in sight. My student continued his approach under the hood. Once the Aircraft Y turned final (I would estimate approximately 1.5 miles ahead of us, at approximately 300 ft AGL), Tower instructed the Aircraft Y to go around. I am unsure of why the go-around was given to the Aircraft Y. I was worried about wake turbulence and began to cycle through options in my head: -I determined I couldn't go around upwind, because I would have to outclimb the short approach of an Aircraft Y to avoid wake turbulence -I determined I couldn't go around straight ahead, because the Aircraft Y had applied takeoff thrust and I cannot out-climb a Aircraft Y in a C172 -I determined I couldn't go around downwind, because the wake turbulence would be blown downwind; additionally, there's a busy tour helicopter helipad just east of the runway 36 threshold so I didn't want to conflict with any helicopter traffic. In the short amount of time this took to unfold, I determined none of the above alternatives were acceptable, which left me having my student continue the approach and just hoping the wake turbulence and jet blast had blown downwind. It is the first time I've ever felt helpless in an airplane, and it really rattled me when I got on the ground and reflected on it. We continued the approach and at approximately 300ft AGL we experienced sharp, jolting turbulence for approximately one second. I believe we were lucky and did not hit the epicenter of the wake turbulence / jet blast, as I know it can flip a light GA aircraft or cause catastrophic damage. After the encounter, my student continued the approach and made a normal landing. In my state of disbelief, I failed to inform Tower of the wake turbulence encounter. After reflecting on the incident, I think both Tower and I could have made better decisions to avoid the encounter, and maybe even the Aircraft Y as well: -I may have had a case of ""get-there-itis,"" as the only scenarios that ran through my head involved continuing forward in some capacity. I believe my best course of action would have been to take controls from my student and execute a go around with a 90-degree left turn, or a left 180 degree turn. It never crossed my mind to turn around, and I will always consider that as an option going forward. -If Tower had been more cognizant of wake turbulence, they likely would not have given a Aircraft Y a short approach in front of a Cessna on final approach -Additionally, if Tower had instructed us to go around, rather than the Aircraft Y, I believe this would have been a non-event. -It is hard for me to tell, but the Aircraft Y performed a pretty wide short approach so maybe they should have kept it a little tighter or declined the short approach. -I don't believe Tower ever gave us a wake turbulence warning after giving the Aircraft Y a short approach. I have been instructing out of MYR in Cessnas for XX years so I am very cognizant of wake turbulence even without ""Caution Wake Turbulence"" warnings from controllers, but I would be worried if a student pilot solo was in that same situation got overwhelmed or couldn't properly visualize the wake turbulence."
1849672,"After deplaning all customers, our flight attendants stated that they smelled musty fumes from the mid to aft cabin area (rows 14-21) during low altitude descent during approach and that the fumes remained until the engines were shut down at the gate. I did not smell any fumes. After obtaining pertinent information from the flight attendants, ZZZ maintenance was notified, and a discrepancy was entered into the aircraft logbook. As was previously stated, the fumes event was brought to our attention only after deplaning was completed and we did not smell fumes in the flight deck."
1848362,"We operated under Medevac, but left the kidney in ZZZ. It all started with a call to Maintenance. While powering on the aircraft, the message ""EICAS OVHT"" flashed a couple times followed by ""EICAS FAULT."" At this point, I noticed a little bit of moisture surrounding the Display Unit. I called Maintenance who suggested that I run the EICAS FAULT check. It worked, the fault cleared, and by the end of my call with Maintenance, the moisture around the Display Unit's dissipated. (I only added that because the moisture was in the back of my mind the entire flight and may have contributed to me forgetting the kidney.) Right after I ended the call, my First Officer got back from his walk around and told me that the nose wheel was missing a bonding strap. I believe it was at this point I'd take a look at the release and was aware of our Medevac status. I called Maintenance back and they told me they'd be sending Maintenance out. While waiting, we set up and briefed for the flight like normal. While briefing the departure, the mechanic arrived and took the logbook with less than 10 minutes to departure time. [Mechanic] handed it back with one minute to go. I took a quick look at it, said it was good and we closed [aircraft door]. After the before start check list, I decided to recheck the corrective action and saw that the mechanic had written main landing gear instead of nose landing gear. I called Maintenance and asked him to express urgency because we were a Medevac flight. While waiting the second time and waiting for the takeoff numbers because the plane was still showing out of service, I asked the rampers if they were sure they had loaded the kidney. He told me he'd double check and came back a moment later saying it was. At XA:55, ten minutes after departure time, the mechanic gave us the logbook back with the edit. We quickly got our takeoff numbers, pushed back and taxied out. While taxiing out, Ground asked us to confirm we were a Medevac flight. At this point, I thought we were, so for the entire flight, we kept the status of Medevac. Just before we started our descent into ZZZ1, it dawned on me that we never received a notification about Dry Ice, thinking that a human organ would need to be kept cool. I checked the takeoff remarks and didn't see anything. I messaged Dispatch who said he'd check with Ops. After we landed, I saw the message that we might not have received the kidney. After parking, I went outside to watch the ground crew unload the bags until they gave me confirmation the kidney was not on board. I did however notice a box wrapped in a red plastic bag. I believe the ZZZ rampers mistook that for the kidney we were supposed to have on board. Even though it would have all but guaranteed a delay, had I gone and looked that the kidney was onboard with my own eyes, all of this would have been avoided. The fact that I was trying to avoid any delays so I could do my part in saving a life ended up causing the biggest delay of all."
1838807,"I was made aware by the A [Flight Attendant] that we only had three of our four required emergency checklists for both ditching and land emergency evacuations. As a crew we determined this to be a ""no-go"" issue, so the A requested one each of the checklists that were missing. We were initially informed that the station didn't have any. Immediately upon being informed of the situation, the Captain became very agitated and began questioning the A as to why we needed the checklists. After an explanation was attempted, the Captain, again in a very agitated manner, proceeded to get on his cell and call the Chief Pilot. As a crew, we checked the manual to confirm that we were correct in our understanding that we had to have four on board and confirmed this to be accurate, to the best of our interpretation. Someone also called for an Inflight Supervisor to come to the gate, but I am not exactly certain which of the crew made that call. A Supervisor did arrive and informed us that they were looking for one, but she had been informed that we were ok using our [tablets] in the event they couldn't find one. At no point up to this time did I feel like anyone considered this more than an annoyance and an unnecessary interruption to their abilities to board the plane for an on time departure. I was even threatened with termination of my job after I said I would not fly if we didn't have the proper equipment. We as Flight Crew are already on high alert where safety and security was concerned, we all felt like no one else cared about anything else but the flight being delayed. I have never felt less supported or more pressured by a Captain in my time of flying. When all was said and done, they found additional copies in the training room, which was what we had recommended about 20 minutes prior."
1838688,"While [enroute] to MMMM (Morelia, Mexico), we briefed and prepared for the VOR DME 2 approach to Runway 5. We were advised by Mexico Center to contact Morelia Approach and to descend and maintain 11,000 feet. Morelia Approach asked us to report 25 nm DME from the airport. At 10 nm DME, Morelia Approach cleared us for the VOR DME 1 to Runway 5. Because of high terrain on all quadrants, night time, unfamiliarity with the terrain/environment, low to the ground condition, we decided to ask the Controller to keep us on the VOR DME 2 instead. The Controller claimed to not have such an approach available for that airport. We told him we had all the information we needed to safely execute the approach in our FMS database. We sighted the runway and asked for a visual approach. We were granted clearance for the visual approach and flew the profile corresponding to the VOR DME 2 approach which we were all set up for. The landing went on uneventfully. In the future, I'll make sure to ask the Controller as soon as able for the approach in use (there was no ATIS at this airport) so that we can set up for the right approach and thus avoid last minute changes which could be fatal specially at unfamiliar/high terrain airports."
1837663,"At (XA05 L) we were cleared for takeoff from runway XX. It was a rainy night after a typhoon had passed through, and although the wind was calm, we needed our wipers on for the rain. We were accelerating normally, I called 80 knots and the captain acknowledged. A few seconds later when my eyes were scanning the engine instruments I heard several thumps against the fuselage and heard the captain say ""Birds."" He later told me he said this when he saw many medium-sized white streaks pass through our lights. I saw the captain pull the thrust levers to idle and say ""Reject."" I believe we were about 110 knots (V1 of 143 knots was well above our speed on the speed scale) but I did not notice the exact speed. After a normal RTO procedure, the captain called and I completed the QRH procedure for Rejected Takeoff. Tower instructed us to make a 180 degree turn on the runway, and after the turn we noticed that the BTMS was climbing more than expected. I calculated for a 120 knots reject at our takeoff weight (345,000 lbs) we should see a BTMS Indication of 5. When the BTMS indication on several brakes increased above 5, I called Tower and requested the fire services to come check for fire and smoke from the brakes. After the fire services arrived and told us (via Tower because fire services did not have an aviation frequencies radio) there was no smoke or fire, we saw one wheel (#2) indicate BTMS 9, and two wheels (#3 and #4) indicate BTMS 8, so asked fire services if any tires were flat. They told us that one wheel on the left side was flat, and at that point the captain decided to start the APU and shut off the engines as it was clear that we would not be taxiing back. I tried calling Company ramp/maintenance on the frequency on the chart but we got no answer, so we asked Tower to relay information to our maintenance and request assistance. Fire services then relayed to us that a tire on the right side was also flat. Maintenance arrived around time XA50 and plugged in to the intercom to let us know they would inspect and decide on a course of action. At XB25 with BTMS in the range of 1-2, they started slowly towing us back to the ramp. We exited the runway at around XC05 and set the parking brake on the ramp at 1825 Z. Multiple Bird strikes on takeoff roll causing a rejected takeoff Airport authority should be better at controlling the birds at ZZZ airport"
1837462,"During boarding First Officer and I smelled an acrid odor. It started to get stronger and the flight attendants called and let us know they smelled it as well. Since the odor was getting stronger and we didn't have any immediate indication as to what was causing it, I chose to expeditiously deplane the aircraft through the main cabin door. While exiting the aircraft, one of the customers remarked that he thought the smell ""was electrical in nature."" After deplaning we called Maintenance out to look at the jet. After some back and forth about possible causes, Maintenance decided to take the jet out of service to do a deeper dive. We swapped aircraft and completed the flight with a different tail number."
1922435,Aircraft X was conducting a training flight in the south central working area. Student was performing a simulated engine failure scenario. Student had selected a field and was approximately abeam the field descending in a power idle glide at 68 knots. Aircraft X was beginning a left hand descending turn to intercept final for the simulated emergency field at approximately 700 feet AGL when an aircraft (Aircraft Y) flew under ours. Instructor immediately took the control and executed a climbing turn away from other aircraft. Instructor was using an iPad with ForeFlight; aircraft was equipped with a stratus. Instructor did not see the other aircraft before beginning the descending left hand turn.
1883723,I was the pilot flying. Low visibility takeoff from [Runway] XXR in ZZZ. After a 30 second engine run up engines were normal. After v1 at rotation speed we experienced a violent bang followed by a right engine failure with associated yaw and severe vibration. I thought we had hit something during takeoff it was so violent. The FO (First Officer) commented 'what was that followed by engine failure? Flames were reported coming out the tailpipe by Tower. The problem was difficult to identify because the only initial indication was low fuel flow on the right engine; other engine parameters indicated normal. We flew the special engine out procedure. Cleaned up the plane and did the engine fire severe damage checklist. We had an amended release for a takeoff alternate ZZZ1. We requested priority handling and diverted to ZZZ1 climbing to 15;000 ft. The weather at ZZZ1 was VMC and the runways were long cleared. We elected to dump the center tank fuel to lighten the plane for landing. At ZZZ1 we were still overweight for landing so we entered holding and contacted flight control about an overweight landing. We then decided to land on [Runway] XXL AT 335;000 lbs. We landed uneventfully and rolled to the end of the runway where we had fire and rescue inspect the plane and were cleared to parking. This was an extremely challenging worst case scenario with poor weather in mountainous weather and an engine failure right after v1 with a takeoff alternate. The [Relief Pilot] and FO did an outstanding job of helping to identify the failure; run checklists and coordinate with ATC and the company.
1892449,After arriving at the gate in ZZZZ; the inflight crew notified me that they smelled a strong dirty sock smell during deplaning. The APU was running; but they smelled the odor prior to the APU bleed being turned on. The odor persisted during the deboarding. I called [Maintenance Control] and local Maintenance came out. I agreed to help troubleshoot by completing 2 engine runs with guidance from the local technicians. Through isolation troubleshoot procedures we determined that the odor existed when either Eng 1 or APU bleed were supplying either or both packs. Maintenance Control and local Maintenance decided to defer both the Eng 1 and APU bleed. After landing in ZZZ on the return flight; the inflight crew notified me that they again experienced the odor during descent at approximately 18k ft.
1923706,Crash Report - Hull Loss - DJI Mini 2 - Impact with tree. No damage to property. Recreational flying - Licensed UAS Pilot - Class D Airspace 0 to 50 ft. with LAANC Authorization. Winds 10 knots with gusts to 20 knots. Mission- Acquire sunset pictures. Decision Error- Attempted to fly between two trees with 15-foot gap at a distance of 200 yards. (Adverse mental state - mission placed above safety; flying an unplanned maneuver.) Temporarily lost sight of drone and immediately went into hover. Operator attempted to reposition to regain sight of drone. Operator was unsuccessful. Operator decided to yaw UAS left 360 degrees to regain situational awareness. Approximately 90 degrees into pivot; discovered that drone was really close to a tree. (Adverse psychological state induced - surprise factor with adrenaline spike). Decision Error- Operator decided to back drone away from tree; prior to completing 360 degree situational awareness pivot. Skill based error (improper control input) Operator applies significant aft control input (still experiencing Adverse psychological state of adrenaline spike). Video image goes wacky followed by loss of signal from drone. Impact with other tree. Adverse physical state: blood drains from head; sick to stomach. Adverse psychological state- Operator remembers that he purchased DJI Care package with purchase of UAS. Operator chooses joy. Operator retrieves UAS and returns to Ready Room to tell other pilots not to do this. DON'T DO THIS!!
1894363,On our descent to Grand Junction we encountered severe turbulence while being vectored to CESBA the IAF on the RNAV 29. We were at the turbulence penetration speed when it occurred due to moderate turbulence most of the flight. It occurred at about 12;500 feet; the aircraft banked approximately 30 degrees; we lost plus or minus 300 feet of altitude and had a 20 kt loss in the sudden descent. We checked in on our FA (Flight Attendant) and passengers and no injuries were sustained. We were also given a 230 heading but during the intense workload but the PF accidentally turned to 320 but was corrected promptly without any issues with ATC. We had to switch to runway 11 after a major wind shift and landed safely to end the flight.
1894632,Cleared to Land on Runway XXL at ZZZ. At minimums call-out was stable and continued. As entered ground effect; the flare was slightly flat causing a bounce. As a result of this the aircraft was left of center line. Right rudder was applied however the aircraft veered to the left and directional control was lost. The aircraft came off the runway and crossed the taxiway coming to a complete stop on the parking area. The propeller had struck the ground at slow speed once entering the taxiway. What I have learnt from this is making sure landings are not flat and the flare is initiated at the appropriate time. Whilst doing so maintain directional control and make sure toes are off the brakes on landing. And to correct in the situation would have been to go around when a bounce occurs and to apply enough rudder to maintain directional control.
1921597,I completed a visual approach and landing on Runway 15 at SAF. After landing on 15 I rolled past Taxiway F and as I approached Runway 02/20 the Tower Controller issued taxi instructions to turn left on 20 and taxi to parking via Taxiways G and A. I did not hear the latter part of the transmission clearly and asked for a repeat. He repeated the instruction as I was turning left onto 02/20. During the turn I struck something; at this time I do not know what I hit but it was large enough to reach the prop and cause significant damage. I immediately informed the Tower Controller that I had hit an unknown object. He had not observed the event. During the approach to landing an airport maintenance truck requested permission to inspect the runway; he did not state why. I assume so but do not know if the sweep was completed or if the object I hit was found. My turn was across the transition paved surface between [Runway] 15 and 02/20. I do not recall any marking on this surface and I do not believe the edges of [Runway] 15 are marked.  When I got the instruction to turn I believe I was too close to the surface over which I taxied to physically be able to see what was on the ground immediately in front of the aircraft. If I hit something like a runway light the runway environment at this location is very poorly marked. If maintenance knew there was a foreign object in the area they should have so stated and cleared the area before any further operations took place.
1906763,Towards the end of boarding B FA (Flight Attendant) asked if I smelled anything unusual aft of the aircraft; I didn't; we waited some more. B FA had communication with flight deck and said that there was a smell aft of the aircraft. I then moved to the left aft of the aircraft to see if I could notice it and did; B FA and I thought it was coming from air vents on top ably everything jump seats. Then pilots made an announcement to let passengers know we might have to deplane; then when we did deplane; maintenance happened.
1897882,Just after acceleration height and after gear and flaps were up; somewhere around 200 kts. we got master caution pitch trim light. Ran the checklist during climb and came to the conclusion we lost pitch trim control meaning the trim was stuck in an aft pitch up condition. Once we leveled off at cruise alt we concluded that 200 kts. was the best airspeed since at that airspeed the aircraft was pretty much trimmed out with very little manual elevator control needed. Called Maintenance and Dispatch and made the decision to continue to ZZZ1. Our biggest concern was how much manual elevator control was going to be needed at landing configuration and which flap setting was going to require the least manual input. Ended up [requesting priority handling] because by asking for XXL it triggered ATC to declare it for us due to priority handling. Landed on XXL with flaps 15 which turned out to be the best configuration since the approach and landing turned out to be a none event. No FAR's or aircraft limitations were exceeded or broken during event.
1931515,Upon approach to ZZZ from the south; ATIS frequency was observed; but no information was broadcast. After contacting ZZZ Approach; was advised that wind was 120 at 10 knots and cleared to enter right downwind for runway XXL.  The aircraft touched down smoothly and inline with the runway centerline. When the nose wheel touched down; the aircraft suddenly veered to the right. Attempts to correct the direction resulted in tire skidding and the aircraft nearly tipped over onto a wing. I allowed the aircraft to continue on course to avoid damage.  The aircraft entered the runway edge grass and the propeller struck a runway light.  The aircraft came to rest with no damage to the airframe or landing gear.  Upon exiting the aircraft; it was observed that the wind had changed direction and the landing had been executed with a 10-15 knot tailwind. ATC immediately changed the traffic pattern to begin landing aircraft on runway YYR after my excursion.
1889438,Received information 10 minutes after push back that HAZMAT was not secured. HAZMAT not listed since it was less than 2.5lbs of dry ice.Flight came back to the gate.
1889455,737-700 pushed back from gate to spot Bravo. Employee followed procedures to remove bypass pin when brakes were set per policy and procedure. Employee put the pin in left gloved hand then proceeded to disconnect the wireless connector that allows communications to the cockpit and the push back driver. Employee put this device in left gloved hand as well. Employee then walked from right side of nose to left side of nose and headed back to gate.Once back at gate was putting equipment back into the lead box and realized that something was missing. Employee retraced steps and saw the bypass pin on the tarmac to just about 3 ft. from the left of the nose gear. The aircraft had already powered engines and was in the process of turning to the right because there was an Airbus directly in front of him.  Immediately notified the lead to get hold of supervisor or control center to have the aircraft stop or return to gate or something so that the bypass pin could be safely retrieved and removed from being a hazard on the tarmac/taxi area.The Captain/Crew did not get notified to stop and as the plane continued around the Airbus the bypass pin was ingested into the #1 engine. Employee and other members of the ground crew saw the bypass pin get lifted from the ground and into the engine and the noise that ensued. The flight had taxied away and when finally returned to gate; Maintenance met the aircraft.
1913818,Taxiing out of ZZZ1 we noticed that the 'LEFT COMM PANEL PTT' was inoperative since Tower was calling the airplane a couple of times to give us climb instructions. Eventually the Captain realized of the malfunction and used the PTT from the yoke. During climb and already past FL180 the Captain also noticed the standby attitude indicator showing 400 ft. above normal altitude and he was showing me where I can find the altimeter reading limitations on the Fault Reporting Code manual. During cruise he also noticed that the radar was showing a lot of 'noise' on the display and we tried to troubleshoot by resetting with no success. The Captain was filling out the [form] with the faults that we had encountered so far while I was still at the controls when he noticed that the 'return to seat' light in the galley came on. He expressed his concern out loud to which I responded that from training I remember that one of the reason the light comes on is because of a depressurization of the 'main cargo deck'. He then looked at the pressurization gauges and read out loud 'Cabin 10K ft.; differential 3.8'; a couple of seconds later it dawned on him what he had just said and immediately proceeds to pull the oxygen mask; don it and broadcast PAN PAN with ZZZ Center. It took me a couple of seconds later to do the same because I just couldn't believe what was happening but shortly after I don my mask and established comms the 'CABIN ALTITUDE' master warning and EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) came on. ZZZ instructed to descend to 16;000 ft. all while I pulled the thrust levers to idle; speed breaks extended; FLCH; and set manually the speed to MMO and the Captain was reading the checklist out loud. After we concluded the checklist and still in a descent we were doing about 5;000 ft./min the Captain noticed that the cabin was staying at 10;000 ft. but the differential was slowly coming down. When we level off at 16;000 ft. ZZZ asked if we wanted to descend to 10;000 ft. The Captain consulted with me and I agreed since we had no high terrain in the area based on the depiction of the terrain feature. We continued the [descent] to 10;000 ft.; removed our masks when we leveled off and the Captain transferred left comm to me so he could talk to [dispatch].ZZZ was asking information about our intentions to what I responded to give us a few minutes since the Captain was conferring with [dispatch] on the next best course of action. I also decided to pull the speed back to 250 KTS to help with the fuel consumption in case we decided to continue to ZZZ2. We had about 30k lbs. of fuel and were burning about 9;700 pounds per hour. Distance to ZZZ2 was showing about 315 nm. ZZZ handed me off to ZZZ3 Approach.The Captain finished his conference with [maintenance] and informed me that they have decided to divert to ZZZ3 since the software used to determine fuel burn numbers wouldn't give information below FL200. I mentioned that we had enough gas to go to ZZZ2 and since the weather was perfect I didn't have a problem continuing but he reaffirmed that without 'official numbers' the safest course of action was to divert. He contacted ZZZ3 Approach; informed our decision. While he was still with [dispatch] I had already pulled out info of frequencies; altitudes; got the ATIS for ZZZ3 and were pretty much ready to brief and run checklists. I did request the Captain to ask for delayed vectors because I didn't feel comfortable with the rush to get us down since we were not in an urgency anymore. When on final approach we noticed the LAND 2; NO LAND 3 on the auto land status. We made an uneventful landing in ZZZ3 and Tower gave us an apron on [Taxiway] 1 to wait for further instructions. During interaction with Airport Authorities I provided some input on informing them of the nature of our cargo (flammable) and seal the airplane since Captain was security coordinator in a situation like this.
1929353,While doing a touch and go at ZZZ airport; the student started to takeoff without getting the carb heat in and the flaps up. I reminded the student that we needed to get the flaps up first and told him to release the back pressure and pull out the power for an aborted takeoff/full stop taxi back. There was a miscommunication with the student and he did not pull the power out right away. We both got fixated on what he was doing with the controls and not where we were going and that there was left rudder being put in. We went off the left side of Runway XX into the grass. No damage to the aircraft or persons occurred. I needed to have made my instruction more clear to him and taken the controls away from him sooner. It was too early to be doing touch and goes and we should have practiced more with stabilized approaches; go-arounds; and full stop taxi backs first. We needed to brief more about aborted takeoffs and the terminology used for putting power in/out/and idle.
1927497,Upon departing the FBO I taxied into a cone. The prop hit the cone with no decrease in RPM. Upon inspection of the prop and finding no issues I departed. The cone did not cause damage to any other aircraft or equipment. I was at an unfamiliar airport and did not receive the customary support from the FBO for parking or departure. However; the mistake was all my own and I plan to be more careful going forward.
1876863,Flight was supposed to be approximately 2.5 hours from ZZZ-ZZZ1. Immediately after takeoff from ZZZ; I (Pilot Flying) realized the electronic trim for the horizontal stabilizer was not working. It was working prior to takeoff and was used to set the proper stab trim. The First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) tried his yoke trim switches; and they also did not work. We ran the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative checklist; which restored our ability to trim the stabilizer using manual trim. A secondary effect of losing electronic elevator trim is also losing the autopilot. We decided the best course of action was to return to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ for an uneventful landing. Airplane was then turned over to Maintenance for repair.No known causal factors. We had been de-iced prior to takeoff; but there is no reason to believe there was any ice buildup or contact with the deicing equipment since the manual trim worked fine.My opinion is this event was the result of a mechanical malfunction. Sometimes complex machines have malfunctions; so I have no suggestions to prevent a similar event in the future.
1919803,On short final for Runway 27 on the RNP-M in SAN. Shortly after my FO (First Officer) called 500 [ft.]; we heard ATC clear an aircraft for immediate takeoff off Runway 27. I instantly conferred whether there was an aircraft on the runway with my First Officer as I could not see anything. We had a very brief conversation about it; questioning if we had a wrong frequency in Comms 2; that had come in for a different airport as we could not see another aircraft on the runway; and it seemed unlikely that such clearance was being issued given how close to touchdown we were. I suddenly noticed the center lights of the runway disappearing and reappearing; subsequently realizing there was in fact an aircraft taking off. Within a second or two; ATC issued a go-around; which I was anticipating at that point and executed instantly. ATC told us to start a left turn almost immediately; which I did as I was concerned about climbing over the departing aircraft.There was a bit of confusion on the heading ATC wanted us to fly on our part; so I continued the turn over the bay where I knew I would have the best visibility due to the lack of city lights. The go-around was uneventful; and ATC gave us further climb and heading instructions putting [us] on the downwind for Runway 27. We ran through our procedures to get the aircraft set up for landing on Runway 27; and landed uneventfully.
1912738,I was working the ZZZ Sector with some afternoon arrival traffic. I received a handoff from ZZZ1 with Aircraft X. I told them to expect the RNAV Runway XXL and descended them to 050. I then went back and cleared Aircraft X to cross ZZZZZ at or above 047; cleared ZZZ2 approach. The pilot read it back correctly. I subsequently slowed the aircraft after the clearance and read back. During my scan; I saw Aircraft X at 042 outside of ZZZZZ in a 044 MVA. I issued a low altitude alert and asked if they had the field in sight. They did so I cleared them for a visual approach to eliminate the MVA requirements; Aircraft X proceeded on the visual; ended up calling traffic ahead in sight; and followed them in landing without incident. This is a tough event to prevent a reoccurrence of from the Controller side because I verified that the read back was in fact correct; even listening to the audio after the fact. Somehow in the cockpit the restriction got lost as far as I can tell. Luckily in this instance; I observed the aircraft descending below my issued restriction quickly and ensured that VMC allowed them to be on a visual approach. The low altitude alert was definitely necessary to prevent a further descent. I will continue to scan at all times to continue to try to catch these errors in the future; and issue alerts as necessary to correct instances like this.
1888970,On Date at approximately XA:00; while PIC on a solo flight in my Extra 300L; I had a rolling electrical failure (first on one device; then sequentially lost use of other devices) about a minute; or so after take-off from ZZZ Runway XX with a left crosswind turnout to the Southwest. Conditions were VMC; sky clear; 10+ miles of visibility. Here is what happened: Shortly after take-off; I noticed that I lost the ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) traffic feature on my G430; so I recycled it; but when the G430; including Com. 1; didn't come back on after 30-60 seconds; I knew something was amiss.  Initially; after the Com. 1 failure; my Com. 2 was lit up; but by the time I went to use it to call the Tower; Com. 2 did not work; I then noticed the Communications panel was dead and then the LED lights on my Com. 2 went out so; I knew it too was dead. It was at this point I realized I had lost my radios and all other electricals as my tachometer too was dead. I ran a quick check of all circuit breakers; all the while maintaining control of the plane and looking for other traffic. All breakers were in; so the only prudent choice for mine and others safety; was to head back to ZZZ (NORDO). Upon reaching midfield to the West of the Tower; at about 1000 ft. AGL; I then circled around in this area to the West of the Tower about 1000 ft. or so away from it and wagged my wings over and over for what seemed like 2-3 minutes or so. To be safe; I did not want to overfly the field because the area to the East of the field there is an aerobatic box that is quite often active and there are helicopters and military aircraft at the field as well as a Company facility. I figured the Tower would see and hear me where I was and could also see me on radar. After some time; I saw no light gun from the Tower at all; so I figured that maybe it was broken. I then went southbound in the downwind towards left pattern for Runway XX and before turning base; I saw that a Aircraft X or similar aircraft was on a take-off roll; so I went back to the area West of the Tower and did some more circling and wing wagging. I was concerned; but not panicked; that this could develop into an emergency; if this electrical failure was the beginning of more going wrong with my plane; (maybe an engine failure; fire; etc.) if there was a short of some kind that might also take the magnetos off-line. So; I wanted to stay close to the field/Runways. Then being in the area to the West of the Tower; after I saw the Aircraft X take-off and away from the area and saw no planes on base; or approach; I figured it was most prudent to bring my plane in for a landing (as the AIM says with a com. failure; 'land as soon as practicable'). As I was already in the downwind for a left base; I kept close to the runway/did a moderately short approach; in case I had an engine failure. This was all the while I was pretty sure that the Tower must have seen me with all my extensive circling and wing wagging. As I was NORDO; I got off on [taxiway] A3 and then taxied back to the ramp. As soon as I exited the plane; I called the Control Tower to let them know I had a total electrical failure and the person I spoke to said given the conditions I did a good job. I gave them my name; tail number and phone number to file in their report to the FAA. They said the total electrical failure would explain why they didn't see me on ADS-B. I was surprised to find out that they didn't have radar at all to see planes with INOP ADS-B. Since the event this is what has been done. The aircraft was grounded and sent to maintenance shop to replace the battery; starter motor; alternator and to check all electrical systems. Return to service logbook sticker will show replaced battery; alternator; starter; etc. What I will do in the future: Carry a handheld battery operated radio and the control tower frequencies in for departure and arrival airports in my phone.
1887607,On Date I was operating Aircraft X for jump operations at ZZZZ.Prior to the incident I (PIC (Pilot in Command)); was told that 13 Skydivers would be practicing for a big way formation jump. There was a minor brief with the Coordinator for the formation jump wherein he advised me that they were planning on having up to 10 Skydivers hanging off of the jump step and in the door situated aft and on the left side of the aircraft. I advised the Jump Coordinator of the following:'This won't work and it's not a good idea. Here's what I mean - If we use a weight estimate of 170 lbs. per skydiver; multiplied by 10 bodies; we get a conservative estimate of 1700 lbs. aft of the center of lift or balance point. This will put the aircraft well out of the CG limitations. If this happens I'll lose pitch control of the aircraft and there's a very good chance the aircraft will stall; and possibly go into a spin.' The Jump Coordinator responded: 'OK; we'll figure out a different configuration.'My response: 'Listen; if your guys don't get this right this bird's going to drop a wing; stall and there's a good chance the aircraft will enter a spin right on top of you guys.'The Jump Coordinator though that I was joking as he responded with a laugh. I replied with a reaffirmation of my previous statement: 'hey man; I'm dead serious! If this happens and that wing drops; you guys need to get the hell out of dodge quick because there's a good chance the plane's coming right on top of you!'Prior to the skydivers boarding I warned my Trainee (who was observing on this flight from the right seat):'If these guys screw this up we're going to get some spin recovery practice... I'm hoping this won't be the case but I'm going to plan for it and carry extra speed as well as trim the elevator forward on the jump run. This way; if we get out of CG and I start to lose pitch authority; it'll buy us a few extra seconds. Just be ready because these guys lose 98% of their brain cells once they get around airplanes... Point being - let's hope for the best but expect the worst.'Takeoff and climb out were normal with no anomalies. At 12;500 ft. I flashed the standby red-light in the back of the aircraft. Two miles prior to the exit point; I turned on the red standby light which gives the 'OK' to open the jump door. 1 mile prior to the exit point; I configured the airplane with 20 degrees of flaps; pulled the power back to 1000 lbs. of torque; pulled the propeller back to the 1st detente; trimmed the nose forward; and put the aircraft in slow flight pitching for an 80-85 kt. airspeed (roughly 10 kts. faster than usual) .From there I turned on the green light signifying to the jumpers that they were clear to exit the aircraft. Immediately; the skydivers began moving from the front of the aircraft and positioning themselves on the step outside of the airplane. A few seconds past when I told my Trainee: 'look; I'm full forward on the yoke; I have no more pitch authority and I'm out of of elevator trim. At that very moment two more skydivers rushed to join the group already at the rear of the airplane. The airplane began to pitch up and yaw to the left. I immediately came in with a slight amount of right/opposite rudder to bring that retreating wing forward; and back into the relative wind. About two seconds later the left wing stalled and the aircraft rolled aggressively into a roughly 80 degree bank to the left which threw the skydivers off of the outside step. Once the skydivers were off of the plane; control was restored back to the pilot (me); I rolled the wings level; took out the rudder input and recovered from the stall and leveled the aircraft off in order to stop it from accelerating past 130 kts.From there; I made my descent to land and all else was fine.
1918784,I was operating flight XXX; ZZZ [to] ZZZ1 on Date. The crew and I were waiting for the aircraft at the gate. Once the aircraft arrived and deplaned; a FA (Flight Attendant) came up and told us about how the APU was inoperative and effected their flight out of ZZZ2. She also stated how there was a smell in the aircraft; but didn't know if it was associated with a fume event or just a funky smell. The FO (First Officer) and I went down to the aircraft and put our luggage into place. Upon entering the cockpit; both the FO (First Officer) and I commented on the smell. The smell did not seem to at first be that of 'smelly socks' but more of what the FO and I described as a well used horse stall. Thinking it was just remnants of a previous crew; we went on with our checks. The FA's got on the aircraft and while preparing for the flight made a comment about the smell. Upon hearing this I walked the aircraft trying to smell for a different smell to see if it was a fume event or just a smell. After getting back up to the cockpit; I asked the FO if he felt any different. He said he felt a little off. At this time; I then told the entire crew to get off the airplane until we figured out the source. It wasn't until the crew was off of the airplane did I start to feel a little light headed. That was when I knew it was a fume event. I then got the logbook and the FO notified Operations that we had a fume event. We waited on MX (Maintenance) to show and I then was asking the crew if anyone felt sick. At first; the FA's didn't say anything about feeling sick. They decided to go back up to the gate and wait inside. I obtained the number for [contract medical service] and advised the lead FA that if anyone of them felt sick to call [the contract medical service] and to also advise their Supervisor. MX had shown up and was addressing the problem. During this; I called [the medical service] and after my phone call with them; they advise me to be checked out by medical professionals. Scheduling then called me because I had timed out and they released me from the flight. I left to seek medical care.
1915775,A few minutes after the plane landed the ramp closed. 10 or 15 minutes after the plane pulled up to the gate the remote van came and parked the plane. As soon as the plane parked customer service pulled the bridge up to the plane and begun to deplane. There was no tail stand and the truck did not put any chocks up to the airplane. A few moments after the bridge was pulled up the nose began to bounce up and down. I called the sup and let them know what was happening and the sup instructed them to stop deplaning.
1872577,Taxiing from gate; approaching A7; ATL Ground cleared us A7 A 26R; taxi speed 15 kts. Fire Truck approaching from the right; high rate of speed crossed in front of us on service road. If I had not stood on the brakes a collision would have occurred. Fire Truck never slowed. Explained the situation to Ground Controller and said that it happens a lot. Fire Truck was returning to station. Did NOT have emergency lights on. Fire Truck driver ignoring ground procedures. Have fire truck driver abide by ground vehicle rules.
1905731,The Captain was flying the leg; and on a vectored base leg to join the approach into ZZZ. ATC asked if we saw the airport and traffic at our 12 o'clock. We called the airport in sight; but not the traffic and we were cleared for the approach for XXR. We dialed in the lower altitude and started descending on the glide slope. At around 3300-3400 ft. we were asked if we had the traffic in sight; we said no and we were told to maintain 4000 ft. I asked if they wanted us to climb to 4000; and we got a vector of 300 away from the traffic and off the approach. Then ATC made the comment it looked like we were on the localizer; and we were told to continue the approach. We rejoined the localizer and continued descending; and it was when we were about 200- 300 ft. below the glide slope that the Captain said something wasn't working right; and added power to climb out. ATC called us with a terrain alert; and we climbed to correct and the Captain finished the approach hand flown. Unclear and misinterpreted instructions by ATC caused us to change automation modes very rapidly in the terminal environment. We think that this resulted in us being in an undesired automation state; and since we were very task saturated; we didn't notice that we were not in the correct mode when the incident occurred. When things get as hairy as they did there; then looking back at it the smartest thing would have been to go around as soon as we were confused about ATC instructions and intentions. It would have given us time and let up on the workload that we were experiencing. Verbalizing task saturation would be good to do as well; and to be more aware of the saturation levels that can happen in the terminal environment.
1877870,After taking off from ZZZ-ZZZ1; we were not able to retract the landing [gear]. At around 35 feet with positive rate after calling for gear up; I tried to put the landing gear lever in the up position and was unsuccessful. We notified ATC and told them what had happened and that we wanted to level off at 3;000 feet and get some vectors so we can complete our required checklist. We ran the QRH and decided to return to ZZZ because there was no (LG WOW SYS FAIL MESSAGE DISPLAYED) so the QRH directed us to land at the nearest suitable airport. We completed the QRH and notified Dispatch of our intentions. We also briefed the flight attendants and passengers about the current situation. We never [requested priority handling] or gave any brace commands because the QRH never called for it and furthermore everything was under control and completely safe. While returning back to ZZZ; I suggested that we held for a few minutes to burn off some fuel and avoid an overweight landing. Once we were below max landing weight; we decided to contact ATC for the ILS XX. We landed without any further incident. On the ground we informed Dispatch and Maintenance Control of what occurred and Maintenance responded that they already knew because their system indicated there was something wrong with the nose wheel sensor. We briefed the Gate Agent and passengers and told them that there will be a replacement aircraft landing soon. After we swapped aircraft we departed without any further incident.
1915614,Aircraft X check on frequency at FL390 requesting FL350. I told him I have his request. I called for control. I couldn't descend to FL350 yet because of traffic at FL370 within 3-4 miles. Aircraft X said he needs to descend now so I turn him; assign him FL380; and call the ZZZ1 traffic for him. He tells me he's looking for the traffic and reads back descending to FL380. I see his data block update to FL377 and ask him about his descent. He tells me he can't maintain the altitude and is going to FL350. I turn him again but lose separation with the other traffic. I had about 4.5 miles going through the altitude of FL370. I ask what the problem is; and he says he's having a pressurization issue but that FL350 should be fine for now. But soon after requests to go lower and eventually we [gave him priority handling]. Just better communication. He said he would like to descend now but did not tell me the reason. If I knew there was an issue I could have given more urgency to vector and descend. I understand it's a possible situation and a pilot is worried about flying his aircraft first. Maybe I could have prevented the separation loss.
1893927,Misread planned dangerous good (DG) summary for final planned dangerous good summary and push back without final. Discovery was made when final weight manifest was sent to printer that included timestamp of when final DG was sent. Contacted Operations and obtained an electronic copy of final DG summary. Flight operated on time.
1890341,On visual approach backed by the ILS into ZZZ XXR; very gusty crosswinds on final. Final configuration checked and checklist complete; at slightly under 100 knots on short final near the overrun; a GPWS warning announced. After assessing glide path was normal; descent rate was normal; no terrain conflict was in sight and airspeed was fluctuating due to gusty crosswind at that moment we felt the we were still in a safe position to land in the touchdown zone and the decision to land was safer than going around with a wide body aircraft turning right over the departure end of the runway. PF (pilot flying) landed in the touchdown zone and brought the aircraft to taxi speed and exited the runway. During the debrief we believe the GPWS warning to be either erroneous or related to the very gusty erratic crosswinds.
1916405,I was outside on [the gate] wing walking on the Captain side; and saw a black passenger bag laying inside the envelope. I tried to move it before the push back as far out as I could. I took a few steps forward to wing walk and turned around and realized that the wing goes out of the safety envelope. I threw up the X but the local didn't see it in time with the engine to my right and the catering truck to my left. The wingtip got stuck on the top to the catering truck. When I turned around to face the local and realized the wing tip was going over the side of the truck I threw up the X. I saw the plane wing grazed the top of the catering truck. I thought that the safety envelope line was correct and that the wings fell inside the envelope; until the push back. During the push back is when the event occurred and it showed that the plane wing fell outside of the line. Crew Chief notified management.
1907482,After takeoff the landing gear would not retract. A Gear Tilt message was displayed on the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System. Also gear door and gear lever disagree messages became displayed. We informed departure of the problem and were given vectors while we ran the appropriate checklists. The airplane never exceeded 265 knots during the flight. We consulted with dispatch; the Duty Pilot; Maintenance Control and the mechanic onboard the aircraft. We came to the conclusion that the best course of action was to divert to ZZZ.Fuel was dumped in the ZZZ area; while in coordination with air traffic control. We proceeded to land uneventfully in ZZZ. Upon arrival in ZZZ Maintenance informed us that a body gear door had separated from the aircraft. I believe it was on the same gear as the tilt message. We did experience some vibration in the airframe at all airspeeds after departure. The vibration remained constant at all airspeeds. The vibration did cease and it is my belief that that is when the door departed the airframe.Gear would not retract after normal takeoff. Gear tilt message. After debrief with other crew members we agreed that the event was handled fairly well. All of us had minor suggestions as to what we do differently if the same event were to occur again; but overall I/we feel the event was handled okay.
1916861,After parking on spot 1 and when we were in the midst of our shut down flows; the parking brake released. I had my feet on the brakes on the rudder pedals; but apparently not enough as the aircraft rolled a couple of inches. In fact; when it happened; I thought to myself; 'Good thing I have my feet on the brakes.'; and wasn't aware we had rolled at all until my First Officer asked; 'Are we rolling?' By the time she asked; the aircraft had stopped and she noticed her brakes were ineffective as my feet were still holding pressure on the brakes.
1909753,During climb out from ZZZZ-ZZZ; CAS (Crew Alert System) message ENG2: PARAM EXCEED annunciation came on; Immediately reduced power and accomplished abnormal checklist; continued to destination because checklist stated no further action required as all parameters were returned to normal. After arrival in ZZZ; contacted Company Maintenance and advised of occurrence. After discussion of issue with Maintenance on phone and other pilot it was decided that since there were no faults recorded in the CMC; no log book discrepancy write up or Maintenance would be required prior to next flight. While investigating a separate aircraft discrepancy that occurred on flight ZZZ-ZZZ1. Company Mechanic advised me that a write up is required for the ENG2: PARAM EXCEED. We then contacted NAME and NAME1 to discuss issue. Aircraft was taken out of service; discrepancies were written up and maintenance arrangements were made. Subsequent investigation revealed that the exceedance is within the transient limit and no maintenance action is required.There should be a CAS amber warning prior to reaching limits not after. A call out and response for power reduction after flaps clean up. If foreseen; pre takeoff brief to include possible distractions at low altitudes during climb out and actions to counter. Example; avoiding Towering Cumulus or VFR traffic.
1926988,On take off; near Vr the First Officer alerted me to the fact that the Right (#2) Engine EGT was starting into the red. We did not have any ECAMs or Alerts because I'm sure they were inhibited. We also did not notice any indications of compressor stall. While continuing a normal takeoff and climb out; I eased the Right (#2) power lever back just a little out of the FLEX position and the First Officer stated that the EGT returned to the green. The EGT was probably slightly in the red for approximately 5 seconds. I then eased the right (#2) power lever back into the FLEX position and the EGT remained in the green and we climbed out normally. The remainder of the flight the engine had all normal indications. After landing and parking at the Gate in ZZZ; I made a logbook write up and called maintenance. To be honest; I have no idea why the engine began to overheat. The temperature was warm outside for ZZZ1; but it wasn't extreme. And we were using FLEX thrust; not TOGA thrust! Maintenance needs to look at this engine to make sure it is preforming properly; so that it doesn't happen to another crew.
1889016,Departed ZZZ on direct flight to ZZZ1; VFR. After takeoff heard position report of local RV-7 on assumed VFR approach to ZZZ - position report indicated '10 miles South of ZZZ airport; inbound for Runway XX'. My position report indicated 'Departing ZZZ to the south-east'. Position reports indicate separation of several miles and that aircraft should not be a factor. Approximately 5-6 miles from ZZZ at 2000 ft. the inbound aircraft passed directly in front of us on descent into ZZZ. No evasive action was required. Neither I nor a passenger with me who also holds a PPL saw the aircraft until it was almost directly in front of us; passing left to right and descending. Discussion with the other pilot was had and we both agreed that the other plane was obscured by the ceiling and A-pillar of the aircraft windshield until it was almost in front of us. I leveled at 2500 ft. and continued on my flight. I called ATC about 2 minutes later to obtain clearance into the ZZZ1 Class C. Approach made no mention of the near-miss and I do not believe that they noticed it. I did not mention the near-miss to ATC but upon landing and researching NMAC regulations under section 3 determined that I likely should have asked to make an NMAC report. After discussion of the situation with my CFI it was decided to make this report and to also alert the FSDO when they open in the AM to file a proper NMAC report.
1905794,As we took off from ZZZ on our way to ZZZ1 climbing through 12;000 I noticed a strange smell. Shortly after; we both noticed smoke in the Flight Deck. While the Captain (CA) and I were processing what was going on and subsequently calling for the Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) SMOKE FIRE FUMES checklist and doing the memory items; the Flight Attendant (FA) called using the EMER call button. After putting our O2 masks on; we answered the call and she said they were also having smoke in the cabin. We said okay and that we were working on it and to keep us updated with any changes. At this point I was running the checklist while the CA was flying. We leveled off at 17;000. The checklist called to [request landing priority] and land. At this point we requested to go back to ZZZ1.After running through the first half of the smoke fire fumes checklist we got to the part where it said to deploy the rat and turn off integrated drive generators (IDGs). The CA and I discussed it and we did not see the need to do this as the smoke began to clear. Therefore; we reverted back to the smoke evacuation checklist. ZZZ Approach gave us vectors for the ILS XR approach. We coordinated with ATC to exit the runway and have crash fire and rescue inspect the aircraft from the outside. After they cleared us we continued to the gate safely. Provide more guidance as to which specific scenario it would be best to run the smoke fire fumes vs smoke evacuation.
1908651,After push back; the Ramp Crew advised me to set the brakes. I thought l had; however I noticed one of the ramp crew waving their wands. I then noticed that the airplane was slowly moving and immediately applied the brakes. No one was hurt and no equipment was damaged.This event has really shook me up. I was sure I had set the brakes; but the parking brake worked correctly for the rest of the flight; so obviously I did not. Contributing to this event was a dark ramp and that I had the dome light on in the cockpit.Obviously; attention to detail on my part. I will also have the dome light off during push back.
1896761,While established in the traffic pattern; we were following the aircraft ahead of us; another C172 at normal sequencing. Following our touch and go on Runway XXL; a Student Pilot in a C172 was cleared for takeoff behind us. The Student Pilot behind us lost situational awareness and turned crosswind early without first clearing the turn visually. This led to us (established in the downwind) getting overtaken by the Student Pilot in the downwind. After becoming visual with the aircraft overtaking us; I executed a right 360 degree turn in order to establish a safe distance between us and the other aircraft. Tower then provided the amended sequencing to the Runway; and the rest of the flight went normally.
1898391,Destination showed 0 SM in ATIS while enroute. Crew informed me that they were planning to set up for a CAT II approach. At this point I rechecked all NOTAMs and saw the 5G NOTAM. I looked at the release and saw that there was a remark that ZZZ AMOC (Alternative Method of Compliance) was approved for Runway XXL. I messaged the crew to tell them that I showed we could only do CAT II on XXL. They responded 'that's what we are seeing also'. A few minutes later I decided to check the AMOC just to be sure. The latest version I had was not searchable and was alphabetical by airport name; not identifier so when I didn't see ZZZ as I expected I would because of the release remarks; I immediately emailed the duty managers and asked for a searchable document in case the airport name was different or I was missing something. I was sent an Excel document and ZZZ was not in it so I immediately sent a message to the crew that the remarks on the release were incorrect and we could not do a CAT II approach to any runway in ZZZ. At this time they were on final approach. They were able to land and I became curious about what their 5G uplink from Company had told them about which runways were in the AMOC. I looked in the ACARs traffic log and saw it told them 'RWY XXL 5G NOTAM IN EFFECT. SOP 5G POLICIES APPLY. RWY XXR 5G NOTAM IN EFFECT. SOP 5G POLICIES APPLY.' I referenced memo number X which told me this message meant 'All runways requested are NOT on the AMOC and FOM/SOP 5G restrictions apply'. This told me that their 5G uplink from Company matched the AMOC but the remark on the release did not. I immediately emailed the duty managers and informed the other dispatchers of the discrepancy. The CA (Captain) called me after the flight and I apologized that the automated release remark was wrong but mentioned that I saw the 5G uplink message was correct. The CA said that he thought the 5G uplink was just telling him that there WAS a 5G NOTAM not that he couldn't do a CAT II to those runways. I agreed that I found the wording of the uplink confusing too but referred him to the memo that explained the meaning of the various messages. I asked him if he ended up shooting the CAT II approach and he said he did not. I decided to file a report because the automated remark on my release was incorrect and I told the CA we were AMOC approved for that runway based on it before I verified it in the AMOC. The incorrect remark combined with the Captain's confusion about the meaning of the 5G uplink message created a situation where we nearly shot a CAT II approach to a runway that could have had 5G interference.The process we use involving release remarks to identify AMOC runways continues to fail us. I have emails showing that every time we have gotten a new AMOC the release remarks have been found to be incorrect for one or more airports. Last month this was not discovered until 20 days into the revised AMOC. On many occasions the subsequent AMOCs are removing runways; giving us further limitations to operations so it's definitely a safety concern when they are not updated. I would personally rather not have a remark on there at all than have the information be incorrect so maybe we should remove the remarks completely since our administrators cannot manage to keep them up to date. The process to needs to be fully audited; changes made to ensure compliance; and continually spot-checked.
1876085,This was the first flight after significant maintenance work on the field at ZZZ; with my autopilot and my turn coordinator both acting up. The shop replaced an autopilot servo and the turn coordinator and returned the plane to service on Date.I did an especially thorough pre-flight and run up but everything checked out. I added a pint of engine oil supplement after a recent oil change during pre-flight. The new turn coordinator worked in taxi and the autopilot worked on the ground. I filed IFR to ZZZ1 and back for a shakeout cruise and proceeded as planned.Approach asked if I was planning approaches at ZZZ1 and I told them I was just doing the shakeout flight; so flying around would be fine. Approach gave me vectors west as I ran through flows; making sure things looked good in the autopilot.About 5 minutes into the flight as I leveled out at 4;000 ft; I heard an alarm or alert and the standby alternator light was activated. I smelled hot electrical smell or smoke and started troubleshooting the primary alternator. There wasn't that much load to shed; but I turned off running lights and strobes and I cycled the alternator on and off. When I turned it off; the alarm or feedback through my headset went away; it came back on when I flipped the primary back on. I cycled it a few times; and the sound eventually faded.I asked to return to ZZZ and soon after [requested priority handling] with Approach. The electrical smell was still there; but wasn't getting worse. Approach asked me about my gear and I was able to deploy it; but I should have waited until closer to the field. Still; once they were down and I had three green lights indicated; the gear was staying down.Approach passed me back to Tower; which cleared me for landing on [Runway] XX Right. I asked for and got [Runway] XX Left; because it was closer to parking but also the nearest runway to me. Tower confirmed gear down and I landed uneventfully. About 50 yards down from my tie-down; a pilot was watching me come in and said he smelled the plane but neither of us smelled smoke after I shut down; so probably something electrical.I'll put the plane back in for maintenance to look at next week; with particular focus on the voltage regulator; alternator and battery.Reviewing the flight and areas of improvement; I should have [requested priority handling] more forcefully. I made the right decision to return to ZZZ to land; it was as close as other options and has services on the field. I also dropped the gear too far out; worried that I wouldn't have power to get them down otherwise -- I should have maintained the slicker plane and dropped the gear closer to landing; as usual.
1892744,Aircraft X had a engine change on the right motor. On the aircraft first departure the flight crew experienced high vibration on the right motor. Was just notified by [Engineering] so awaiting for more information at this time; and will provide [information] in the [company reporting form] as we progress with the report.
1908811,I contacted the ZZZ ground controller and informed them of my intentions to depart to the North West on a flight to the X area and then continue north to ZZZ1 airport; and then gave the current ATIS info.  I was cleared to taxi to runway ZZ.  Upon contacting the tower for a takeoff clearance; I was cleared for takeoff and given instructions for a right turn to the North West. I cleared the runway and turned right to the North West per clearance instructions. After clearing the horizontal and vertical limits of the delta airspace I requested permission for a frequency change. The tower controller approved my request for frequency change. I then changed frequency to ZZZ approach to request flight following and permission to fly a sight seeing path over the X area. Upon switching channels; I attempted to contact the ZZZ approach controller three separate times; between other aircraft transmissions; with no response.  The approach controller responded on the fourth attempt. There was never any concern with my position. After I was given a squawk code; I instructed to remain outside of the Bravo airspace; but I was not given a clear clearance into the X [area] airspace ('not approved or denied.....') per the controller.At this point I had a large cloud to my left; Bravo above and to my right and a layer of clouds in front of me that I could not climb above without violating the Bravo airspace. I could not turn left without violating VFR cloud clearance spacing.  The only option left was to descend below the clouds in front of me before breaching cloud clearance. My descent apparently put me near the path of inbound traffic; that was on the other side of the clouds to my left which blocked my field of vision.  I never saw the traffic. Nor did I feel any wake/turbulence. I was never in the clouds. The air continued to be smooth.  Upon my return I was informed to contact the tower. I was then informed of a possible deviation.  I wasn't given a restriction to deviate from.For topics relevant - I was never given a heading; an altitude restriction; or informed of inbound traffic (at any point); by the ZZZ tower. I was on a climb and still below three thousand feet at the time of incident; therefore plus 500 did not apply.Prevention of recurrence - Aircraft departing airports that sit under a busy airspace should be given more attention; particularly when the departure direction keeps them engaged with multiple airspaces/special use areas; i.e. issue squawk code before clearance to takeoff.  Tower controllers should be informed of inbound / handoff traffic earlier.
1871669,The nose of the aircraft slide across the hold short line of [Runway] XXR. We advised Tower that the nose came across the hold short line. They issued an abort for a AC that was just issued a take off clearance on [Runway] XXR. The Tower thanked us for letting them know soon because the aircraft did not initiate the takeoff role. There was active snow and the hold short line and sine was covered in snow. As I preceded to stop the aircraft it was on ice so it slide to a stop just past the hold short line. The nose was between 5 feet to10 feet past the line The taxiing was difficult because of all the snow very slippery there were many times that the ac was slipping. It would have been nice if the taxi services were plowed and treated. The hold short sine was covered in snow and was difficult to see with the active snow.
1900799,ATC informed crew that [we would] have to remain at FL330 due to crossing traffic. After traffic passed overhead at approximately 2;000 feet above aircraft; ATC instructed [us] to climb and maintain FL370. At FL335 crew encountered the wake of the aircraft that had passed above. Aircraft snap rolled in a split second to an estimated 90 degrees to the right and pitched down 5 degrees. Crew recovered the aircraft extremely quickly and climbed to FL370. One passenger and aircraft technician were not buckled during the incident. No injuries or issues noted. Passengers were informed directly after encounter by the PIC as to what happened. Aircraft landed with further incidents. Maintenance team performed inspection for excessive G loading after landing as a precaution. Excessive G loading was not experienced during event. No damage was found.
1892245,On straight-out departure from CNO to ZZZ tonight just after sunset; I planned to climb to 2600 ft. MSL but misread the altimeter and leveled off at 1600 ft MSL. The dim lighting condition of the dusk and the shade on the altimeter due to the downward angle of my headlight were contributing factors. It was difficult to judge my altitude above ground when it is getting dark but not completely dark. As I approached Chino Hills; my GPS terrain warning system was activated which prompted me to re-check my altimeter reading and realized I was 1000 ft. below my planned altitude. I started climb out immediately and cleared the hills at 2500 ft. MSL. Although I may have stayed legal in this process by initiating the climb early enough before the rising terrain; the highest terrain in that area is ~1500 ft. MSL and I could have been involved in an accident if the error in my interpretation of the altimeter reading was not corrected promptly. In addition to cross checking instruments and pilot carefulness; an altitude check from the ATC (in this case the CNO Tower) acknowledging 'altitude 1600 ft.; frequency changed approved' if workload permits at dusk and night may be an additional preventative measure.
1884667,We had a smoke; odor & fumes event.This was not a A320 dirty socks event... on approach about 6;000 AGL I was notified of a faint electrical cord burning smell in aft cabin/galley area. I told the FA's (Flight Attendants) to keep me informed if it got worse and we would land in a few minutes.I was told upon arrival at the gate the FA's speculated it was probably smell from a passengers older laptop (FA's said faint electrical burn smell in back of aircraft that went away fairly fast). I speculated it was possibly pollution smell as we were on descent well below 10;000 ft.The FA's did report that they turned off the passenger charging ports when they detected the smell  I noted this in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry and report.No passengers or crew reported ill effects.Dispatch notified; Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry made; Smoke; Odor & Fumes form completed; and conference call with Maintenance Operations Center and [Checklist] completed upon arrival per Flight Operations Manual.
1918380,Drone lost link; no communication of this. Called ZZZ [TRACON] and they said it lost link. Recommendation- Communicate when a drone looses link.
1887319,We were flying a Visual Approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ. At about 1500 ft. MSL; Tower offered us Runway XXL; seemingly due to closeness of the aircraft in front of us. We were given 160 kts. until the marker; and had not configured to our final flaps (30). When we accepted Runway XXL; I 'went inside' and re-tuned to the Runway XXL Localizer. We made the 1000 ft. call; but had not fully configured. We got a 'Too Low; Flaps' alert and I selected flaps 30. I had 'tunnel vision'; focusing on the approach profile; which was normal; and didn't call for a go-around. We continued the approach and landing.Don't accept a runway change close in. We should have gone around when we got the alert. Aviate first; (complete configuring); then Navigate (I was distracted when I re-tuned and we really didn't need the new localizer to fly the visual); then Communicate (we both missed the Before Landing Checklist).
1930688,I arrived to work at XA00 for a midnight shift and assigned both North Control and CIC (Controller in Charge). Middletown Sector was staffed with a Controller only; not CIC capable in the Tracon. Prior to me signing on; Management was informed that one of the 4 midnight Controllers would not be in until XC00L. No Controllers or Supervisors were required to be held over to help out with the extraordinary departing traffic or TFR for the event. OSU; a Contract Federal Control Tower stayed open until XE00L; normally closes at XB00L; for the departing traffic. I also informed ZID Columbus sector that I had 35 departures proposed at XC00L and that it would be abnormal traffic for a typical [night]. They thanked me later that I informed them of the extra traffic as they help over extra Controllers to help them work the abnormal traffic. As a CIC; I had a report of a UAS in the TFR and was not able to relay the information to the DEN (Domestic Events Network) until 3 hours after the incident. Management should have been in the facility the entirety of the TFR to help with coordination. 3 Controllers for 3 positions as well as CIC is not a safe operation.
1923391,We were operating Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1; with a planned departure from Runway XX; due to the remaining runways being closed. Based on our performance calculations; we were legally and safely able to depart from that runway. We lined up on Runway XX and pushed up the thrust levers for takeoff. Just after commanding 'set thrust'; we received an aural alert stating 'CAUTION SHORT RUNWAY; SHORT RUNWAY'; as well as an EICAS message stating ' SHORT RUNWAY'. I immediately rejected the takeoff and retarded the thrust levers. We notified ATC; taxied clear of the runway; and found a spot to park the aircraft in coordination with ATC. After bringing the aircraft to a stop and completing the after landing checklist; I called the Duty Officer; who arranged a conference call with Captain. Based on their guidance; we temporarily selected the GND PROX RUNWAY OVRD switch to inhibit the RAAS (Runway Awareness and Advisory System) from giving us another alert on our subsequent takeoff. We completed the RTO checklist; as well as the after start and before takeoff checklist; verified our fuel was sufficient per the Flightplan/Release; and proceeded for another takeoff; which was uneventful. The RAAS on the B777 did what it was programmed to do; which is to alert the crew on a runway that has an available length of less than 7;500 ft. and the ground speed is greater than 40 kts. Runway XX at ZZZ has 7;278 ft. available. Not being familiar with this particular alert; I decided to reject the takeoff. I have never encountered this scenario in my six plus years of operating the B777; mainly because takeoffs on relatively short runways are rare; but I also do not recall seeing this scenario in any training environment. Maybe I missed it somewhere along the line; but it could be incorporated in a future syllabus.
1869925,On departure; [we] received [an] UNABLE RNP EICAS message. [We] believed [the message] to have been directly related to [a] local 5G NOTAM. Due to ATC informing us of [a] previous departure receiving effects of 5G-related malfunctions; [we] strongly believe this to be related to 5G near PDX. 5G near airports is a safety issue affecting automation and navigation.
1895081,After run-up and instrument check; departed ZZZ2; picked up IFR pop-up clearance to ZZZ3 with 3 souls on board and 4 hours fuel. Approximately halfway to our destination; we suffered complete electrical shut down. Momentarily losing control in a dark cockpit in IMC at night; we lost our checklist and flashlight to the floor. Making available the artificial horizon on Foreflight coupled with a stratus and opening Foreflight on iPhone with the use of an Approach plate into ZZZ1; the most direct route to final was made and so was a safe landing. Once on the ground; an immediate call to ATC was made with a report of the situation. In future; I will be wearing a head-light and my checklist secure within hands reach.
1891576,On take-off roll; the yaw damper engaged while in the off position and took control of rudder pedals. Take-off was aborted.
1891422,Just before departure; I received one of the newer NOTAC (Dangerous Goods Form) stating we were carrying two fire extinguishers. The airbill # was XXX-XXXXXXXX. I kept one copy and returned the other to the Ops Agent. Since I hadn't seen the new forms yet; I looked in my EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) for information and looked in the Manual. I found the relevant sections detailing the new form and when it was required. During cruise; I looked over the form again and saw a note in the corner saying that a note was required to be on the Release indicating Dispatch was aware of the HAZMAT and it was entered on the Dispatch Release for tracking purposes. Since this had not been done; when we landed I called Dispatch and we conferred. He said there was nothing to be done at that point and so I am filing a report as my action.
1932488,On an IFR flight plan into ZZZ with a student under the hood flying the LOC Y Runway XX low approach only. We were on approximately a 2 mile final and at this point a Citation which we had been tracking on our ADS-B was now same altitude off our right wing. They were previously issued an instruction to follow my aircraft and be number two for Runway XX into ZZZ. The Controller in the Tower was asking for multiple position reports from four aircraft inbound to the field. The Controller then issued the Citation a right 360 instruction and rejoin final for Runway XX. This instruction turned the Citation right over the top of my aircraft and the ADS-B in was alerting traffic was 400 ft. directly above us. Following that we were given the instruction to go missed at 800 ft. MSL and 1 mile for the runway. The student executed the missed as instructed by Tower and I informed the Tower of the near midair collision from my perspective and loss of separation. Though I believe the verbiage I used on the radio of the time was 'near miss.' I was then given a phone number to call once on the ground; which I did and spoke with the Controller on duty at the time of the near midair collision. When asked why he turned that aircraft into our flight path; his response was because he didn't want to turn them over the field and they were above us. This entire event could potentially been avoided if the Tower had radar; but they don't and rely on aircraft reporting their positions.
1907055,"At FL380 we received a CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING"". We immediately donned oxygen masks and established crew communications. The First Officer (FO) contacted ATC and I started an emergency descent. The FO ran the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist. As we were descending; the FO stated that the cabin altitude was 9000 ft. The CABIN ALTITUDE warning light remained on for about 8-10 minutes and then extinguished. I don't know exactly at what altitude this occurred; but I believe it was in the low teens. After the FO completed the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist; requested special handling and coordinated a divert into ZZZ. We accomplished all normal checklists and an uneventful ILS XXC approach and landing. We taxied into parking without incident. CABIN ALTITUDE 2 was enunciated on the status page. My ears popped as we received the warning and I felt slightly light headed as I was donning the oxygen mask. It went away shortly thereafter. Overall; I think we did a good job. I could have included the experienced jumpseater in the resolution of the event sooner. Once he was involved; some of the load was lifted from the FO and I. The other jumpseater was a new hire and this was his first flight on the 757."""
1893869,Departing [Runway] XXL ZZZ XA:35 on Date; a pair of military helicopters were passing left to right over Runway YY; below 100 ft.  We switched to tower frequency and received immediate takeoff clearance w/ traffic advisory on 6 mi final.  Not advised of military helicopters flying in formation over Runway and as we began takeoff roll we assumed they would hold short of XXL. As it became evident they would not; an abort was quickly considered; and I decided against it as we had entered the high speed regime.  We delayed rotation as we ran directly below the two military helicopters; had we rotated we would have collided.  Had the military helicopters had a midair; or descended we would have collided.  Contacted ZZZ Tower upon arrival in ZZZ1; Supervisor initiated an investigation. Received a call several hours later from supervisor requesting additional info.  Sup stated we should have been advised of military helicopters traffic; however a review of tapes indicated no advisory was made.  He further stated that evidence reviewed warranted further investigation; that he was writing a report and submitting it for review of procedures.If we were made aware of the traffic there is 0% chance we would have accepted the takeoff clearance. Suspect local controller was distracted by traffic on final.This was an unsafe operation; we should not have been given takeoff clearance; or advised of traffic so we could have not taken off.  In retrospect an immediate reject while still in low speed regime may have been the safest course of action; but we really expected them to hold short of our runway.
1876484,I was flying Aircraft X Cessna C-172N from ZZZ to ZZZ1. This was a personal flight to help maintain pilot proficiency. This is a rental aircraft from a flight school located at ZZZ. I did a full checklist-based pre-flight inspection; and normal takeoff from ZZZ. Flying my planned ZZZ1 RNAV XX approach; I proceeded to ZZZZZ; via ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ2 altitudes; and performed pre-landing checks. Had 4 white lights on the Runway XX PAPI; reduced power to lose altitude and speed. PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; I adjusted power and attitude to maintain glide slope. Checked airspeed was in the white; added first notch of flaps. Waited for aircraft to stabilize; verified PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; checked airspeed; adjusted power; added second notch of flaps. Almost immediately after second notch of flaps there was a loud bang; an immediate turn to the right; losing altitude very quickly. I corrected the uncommanded turn as much as possible; adjusted power to maintain altitude; looked for cause of problem. I noted one flap up; one down; and went around. Gained altitude; circled; and carefully explored controllability of the aircraft; 'no change' to the flaps was best for aircraft controllability. I landed without incident. In addition to the control system failure; the aircraft apparently suffered damage to the flaps. The flight school Mechanic; and the flight school; are not communicating with me; so I do not know the extent of the damage. A careful look at GPS data shows the aircraft was operated within limits; including Vfe; at all times prior to the incident. While this flight ended with a safe landing; for me this was a very close call; and caused me a few sleepless nights processing the event. I was mentally processing the event through the evening of Date1; and did not report the control system failure as quickly as I should have. It took me a while to overcome the seriousness of the event before I started my reporting responsibilities.Not having any communication or support from the flight school added additional delay. I was hoping for more information and cooperation from the school in the reporting process; as well as resolving what happened and how to avoid this situation in the future. I regret my delay and have reviewed my reporting duties and responsibilities as pilot in command to help ensure prompt reporting as required by regulations.
1913350,My student and I flew to ZZZ1 where we executed multiple successful touch and goes. We experienced very slight engine roughness during one of our takeoffs from ZZZ1 for a brief second due to my student advancing the throttle too quickly. Other than that; nothing was out of the ordinary. After a few landings we departed for one more touch and go at ZZZ.The approach into ZZZ was normal; and we had no indications of engine trouble. After touching down on Runway X; my student added full power to takeoff; forgetting to remove the flaps beforehand. Flaps were set 20 degrees; so our initial airspeed after lift off was very low (somewhere around 50 KIAS). This was the first moment I came on the controls; only to keep my student from pitching up anymore; and to keep him from removing the flaps before we were at a safe airspeed/altitude to do so. Still assisting my student with slight forward pressure on the yoke to allow airspeed to increase; I removed 10 degrees of flaps. As soon as I set the flaps from 20 to 10 degrees; the engine began running extremely rough and we experienced a partial loss of engine power. I cannot recall the exact altitude; but we were roughly 400-500 ft. AGL. So that leaves us at a very low altitude; with little to no runway left ahead of us; and a decrease in lift from reducing flaps just before the loss of power occurred.I immediately took over the flight controls. I noticed we went from a respectable climb rate to only maintaining level (at full power). I verified the fuel selector was on both; fuel mixture was full rich; and checked engine instruments. Oil pressure read slightly high; nothing catastrophic. However; the roughness sounded and felt to be getting worse; and I was not confident that we would be able to maintain altitude much longer. Due to our critically low altitude; and the uncertainty of whether or not the situation would deteriorate further in the next few moments; I made the decision to execute a precautionary landing; while the possibility of landing on a runway still existed. I informed ZZZ Tower that we were experiencing engine roughness and stated that I was turning around to land Runway XY. At the time I made that call; I did not declare an emergency because it was only engine roughness; and although it was the worst engine roughness I've ever heard; and I was fearful that the engine would give out - it hadn't yet and we were still making power. I was prepared to declare an emergency if the situation got any worse; but after the point when I began my turn there was no time to do anything except fly the airplane.I made a left turn into the wind to begin my descent for Runway XY. Losing altitude in the turn; and considering load factor/airspeed; I turned with the minimum radius possible while avoiding a stall/spin situation. The stall horn came on for a moment; and it became clear that we were not going to make the runway. I had a few moments left to consider the remaining options: land on Taxiway 1; or try to clear the GA ramp/Terminal to land in the grass beyond them. The Taxiway was the safest option; considering no other aircraft were occupying it at the time; and Runway XZ-XA is closed. I touched down on Taxiway 1; brought the airplane to a stop; and regathered my thoughts. Tower asked if our engine was still operational; to which I answered yes. I offered apologies to the ZZZ Tower for landing on Taxiway 1; because as mentioned above; I did not have enough time to declare an emergency/update them on my situation once I began the descent to land. I requested to taxi to the GA ramp and shutdown.Final words:If I could have a second chance on dealing with this scenario; I would have done everything exactly the same. As much as I wanted to fly a pattern for Runway X and do a precautionary landing with a headwind; that option did not seem to be on the table. My choices were:Enter a downwind for Runway X and hope we keep the limited performance we have to make it all the way around the pattern; orLand the plane as soon as possible before it turns into a complete power lossI chose the latter and would do it again.
1935714,During pre flight in cockpit the aircraft was felt to lurch and shake. Followed by constant vibrations and another lurch. I witnessed the bag loader from the jet bridge in contact with the plane. Ramp agent said she contacted the plane with the belt loader and then backed off.
1866852,Very short taxi to [Runway] 8L in Ontario so we had discussed and ran before takeoff checklist down to the line before leaving ramp. As we approached 8L I had called Tower and let them know we were ready for departure. If I remember they briefly told us to hold short awaiting IFR clearance and then it was just a couple seconds later she cleared us for takeoff on Runway 8L. The Captain was taxiing the aircraft into position as I was running the before takeoff checklist. As the airplane was just getting aligned with centerline the Captain mentioned he thought there was something on the runway. I was actually looking towards the far end of the runway to see if I could see any type of strobes or lighting as it was night time. It was once we had all the aircraft lights on that we could clearly see a van parked broadsided right on the middle of the runway about 1;000 feet in front of us or so. I had not yet called before takeoff checklist complete or verbally mentioned Runway 8L verified before the Captain had noticed something on the runway. No takeoff power was added or anything like that. I called the Tower to let them know there was a vehicle on the runway and the controller seemed very surprised. The controller cancelled our takeoff clearance and gave us a clearance to line up and wait. Controller then began communicating with FAA ground vehicles to try and get a hold of whomever was on the runway. Controller was unable to contact vehicle on the runway but was able to get a nearby airborne helicopter to hover over the vehicle and use a spotlight and or loud speaker to alert the personnel on the ground. We saw the ground personnel then run over to the vehicle; hop in; and drive off. The tower controller then had another FAA vehicle do a runway inspection the length of the runway and verify that everything was clear of the runway. Once the runway was verified to be clear we were once again cleared for takeoff. We ran the before takeoff checklist below the line again as it had been several minutes since our initial takeoff clearance. We departed ONT without further incident. The controller was very apologetic about the issue. Not sure exactly what happened or where the breakdown was that allowed the vehicle onto the runway without the controller's knowledge. It would have been very very difficult for controller to see the vehicle on the runway from the tower.Some type of breakdown in communication between FAA Ops vehicle/operator and Control Tower. The controller mentioned to us that the vehicle had not been authorized to be on the runway. I believe the operator had been out on the runway changing lights possibly? I do know the vehicle was running though and there was not anybody in the vehicle. Not exactly sure how/why vehicle had gotten out onto the active runway without authorization. Better communication/procedures between Ground Ops/Tower. I also think that if you're going to have vehicles like that on the runway; especially at night; they should be required to have some sort of strobe or beacon light. The vehicle was honestly very hard to see before all of our aircraft lights were on. If the vehicle had been further down the runway; I'm not sure we would have noticed it before we began the takeoff roll.
1933225,After takeoff from Runway XXR at ZZZ; First Officer was flying; he noticed his electric trim was not working. We continued to climb and retract the flaps; to get some altitude to troubleshoot while manually trimming the aircraft. My electric trim refused to work as well. I pulled the checklist for Stab Trim Fail to start working the problem while [the First Officer] controlled the aircraft; and we elected to stop climbing at FL 190. We elected to return to ZZZ; and ATC gave us vectors to return and descend. I alerted Dispatch that we were returning; told the Flight Attendants; and made an announcement over the PA to the Passengers. First Officer continued to fly the aircraft with me assisting with the manual trim; while I got the performance numbers loaded and worked the radios. I briefed the approach to Runway XXR; then took over flying for the final approach and landing. After landing we ran the brake cooling [checklist]; and it indicated that we were good to taxi to the gate.
1917899,Aircraft received landing gear airground fail message on short final. Performed go around; ran QRH; came back to ZZZMaintain vigilance for changing conditions.
1925122,On our go around from [Runway] 19R in Las Vegas we encountered a RA from a departing air carrier. My FO (First Officer) failed to respond in a correct and timely manner so I took control of the aircraft and complied with RA. When I looked outside the window and saw how close the other aircraft was I turned as well to the rear of the plane. I think that the FO did not comply with the RA. Also Tower couldn't give us instructions fast enough to avoid the conflict. Better training.
1891775,During cruise; about an hour after departure; both FMC computers stopped working for about 25 seconds (roughly). The FMC option disappeared from both CDU MENU screens. Both moving maps stopped; all performance data was removed and the autopilot defaulted to CWS roll (as anticipated) when the navigation data became unavailable. We began the process of verify raw data navigation when both FMC computers came back online and proceeded to operate normally. Operationally; we called Operations Control and Maintenance Control and concurred that we were safe to continue. Basic navigation was unaffected and so the safety of flight was not reduced in the event it happened again. However; it does seem to qualify as a serious impact on aircraft systems -- especially since the design redundancy did not work (both sides failed simultaneously). Because the system reset itself normally and did not repeat the fault; it qualified as an INFO-ITEM and the AML entry was made in ZZZ; but the event also appears to qualify as a mandatory report. The description is the same verbiage used in the report. There were no additional factors that indicated the reason that both FMC computers would simultaneous shutdown and then simultaneously restart. No turbulence; we were not interacting with either CDU at the time; nothing. The event is very strange since it caused a breakdown in the 'design through redundancy' principle.Simultaneous failure of redundant systems is a bigger problem than 'an anomaly'. We happened to be in cruise within VOR and VHF range. If this had happened at a more critical time of flight-- where time critical usage of the FMC is greater-- this would have been a larger problem. If this had happened when we were beyond VOR/VHF range; this would have also caused a more serious impact on flight safety. When the FMC computers went offline; we had no access to GPS or IRS navigation data. We also lost all access to FMC performance data. Finding the cause and correcting it appears to be a high priority.
1916103,Early in the boarding process; the B-Flight Attendant came forward a let me know there was a passenger who was cleaning a row of seats with an aerosol spray cleaner. In addition the passenger was verbally difficult when the matter was brought up with her. The Flight Attendant asked for a Customer Service Supervisor. I was able to locate one and requested that she speak with the B-Flight Attendant and the customer to ensure there was not going to be any issues airborne. I was not specific with her about the spray cleaner as I was more concerned that there would be a personality conflict. In addition; throughout this time I was managing two new MELs with Dispatch and Maintenance. Upon completion of that effort; I understood that the issues in back were resolved and we proceeded without incident. Later in the day I asked how the flight had gone with the passenger in question and while they handled the personality clash; no problem we reflected back upon the aerosol issue. It seemed the cleaner was still on the aircraft. I reviewed the FOM and the First Officer reviewed the Company manual. It appeared from that review that the item could have been considered a HAZMAT item that may have been required to be in the checked baggage; vice carry on. What was also noted was [that] there is the HAZMAT Hotline that would have been able to make the proper assessment of the item.
1909769,Air Turn Back. A/C X took off from ZZZ and got engine oil temp alert. Temp went into the red. The Captain followed Quick Reference Handbook and rolled engine back to idle. The temp dropped into Amber. Flight landed back in ZZZ. No request for priority made.
1929726,Practicing power off 180's with Instructor at ZZZ. I did a GUMPS shock midfield; but failed to extend the gear. Once power was set to idle the gear unsafe horn came on; after doing various other power off maneuvers at altitude; my brain ignored the warning horn and I became hyper focused on speed and my landing point. Flew the approach and upon entering into ground effect I noticed something was wrong as the wheels should be touching. I looked down and the horn came back into focus and I caught the error. Immediately added power to initiate a go-around and upon doing so the prop stuck the runway. I was midfield and committed to the go-around at that point and began the climb. I was shaken up so I handed the controls over to my Instructor. The airplane did not indicate any adverse effects; no vibrations and the climb was normal.I have a lot of time in the Arrow and always go a GUMPS check once on downwind and a secondary gear check on final; my failure to comply with my own personal procedure led to this happening. Also I noticed a better glide and that should have been another indication that something was wrong.For the future; I will be sure to continue utilizing a GUMPS check and secondary gear checks as well as adding a third while crossing the threshold and not tuning the gear unsafe horn out. Also I need to be more mindful of becoming hyper complacent in airplanes that I am comfortable with; as well as being impulsive during times of high workloads. For a future abnormal procedure where a landing is aborted in a high stress environment; I need to focus on flying the airplane. I was able to focus to initiate the go around and the climb; but I felt the need to transfer controls after I began to think about what just happened rather than flying the airplane. Lastly; and most importantly I need to be mindful of becoming hyper focused on a few items and be more Thorough with checklist items and keep a good scan going throughout every maneuver.Airplane is grounded and has been reported.
1882701,Aircraft had MEL 34-XX-X and MEL 34-XX-Y. ATL was conducting ILS Runway 26R. I was flying had nav1 signal for LOC 1 with IGXZ on PDF. The LOC became intermittent working and red flag in VMC conditions. Corrected each time but was vectored around for another approach. During this apprise the FO (First Officer) NAV 2 LOC was working. Briefed the changes due to FO will be flying now. When cleared for approach the Flight Director failed and came back. Still VMC and then the FO nav 2 loc 2 went red with red loc flag; which went back to green. Told ATC again there was a problem. Low on fuel we diverted to ZZZ. Discussed with Dispatch. Landed with 1;600 lbs. ATL Approach was very helpful and understanding. Loss of reliability with navigation NAV 1 and NAV 2.
1921391,I was on my break. The purser woke me up and told me that I was needed in the cockpit. I saw that we had offset 5 miles right of course and I was told of the problem. The L ENG OH checklist had been accomplished. When the left throttle was reduced to idle; the L ENG OH message went away. We were between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 on the D track to ZZZ Airport. We [requested priority handling] and received clearance to descend to FL310 and then turn left and proceed directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We made a radio call on XXX.XX stating our position and our planned descent. The L ENG OH checklist came on again on the EICAS. We did the checklist again and this time; when the throttle was reduced to idle; the message did not disappear. We continued the checklist and shut down the left engine. We got clearance to FL200 and we flew directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We communicated with Dispatch; ZZZ Radio; the Flight Attendant's (FA) and made a PA to the passengers. We were given priority vectors to Runway XXR and landed uneventfully.  We taxied clear of the runway and had the Fire Chief look over the plane concentrating on the left engine. We then taxied to Gate XX and shut down.Cause: The L ENG Fire Loop has apparently been replaced 3 sequences prior to our flight. My guess is that it was not completed properly.Suggestions: I don't know how it could have been prevented; but I will say that the training we receive at recurrent is excellent. We performed very well as a team. We discussed things together before executing anything.
1919103,During descent in VMC; the Captain PF (Pilot Flying) asked me; FO (First Officer) PM (Plot Monitoring); to request a VMC descent from Denver Center. Our clearance at the time was to cross the Dunoir DNW VOR at 14;000 ft. I requested the VMC descent from Center. Center asked if we were requesting a Visual Approach and I believe I said yes and they may have said to expect that. Our understanding was that we were cleared to descend VMC. The Captain then began a VMC descent prior to reaching DNW. At approximately 12;700 ft. ATC issued a low altitude alert and told us to climb to 14;000 ft. We told them we were descending VMC to the airport. They asked if we wanted to cancel IFR to which we replied yes. They then said 'IFR cancellation received; squawk VFR; frequency change approved'. We then contacted the JAC Tower; conducted a Visual Approach and landing to Runway 19 with no issues.
