I contacted the ZZZ ground controller and informed them of my intentions to depart to the North West on a flight to the X area and then continue north to ZZZ1 airport; and then gave the current ATIS info.  I was cleared to taxi to runway ZZ.  Upon contacting the tower for a takeoff clearance; I was cleared for takeoff and given instructions for a right turn to the North West. I cleared the runway and turned right to the North West per clearance instructions. After clearing the horizontal and vertical limits of the delta airspace I requested permission for a frequency change. The tower controller approved my request for frequency change. I then changed frequency to ZZZ approach to request flight following and permission to fly a sight seeing path over the X area. Upon switching channels; I attempted to contact the ZZZ approach controller three separate times; between other aircraft transmissions; with no response.  The approach controller responded on the fourth attempt. There was never any concern with my position. After I was given a squawk code; I instructed to remain outside of the Bravo airspace; but I was not given a clear clearance into the X [area] airspace ('not approved or denied.....') per the controller.At this point I had a large cloud to my left; Bravo above and to my right and a layer of clouds in front of me that I could not climb above without violating the Bravo airspace. I could not turn left without violating VFR cloud clearance spacing.  The only option left was to descend below the clouds in front of me before breaching cloud clearance. My descent apparently put me near the path of inbound traffic; that was on the other side of the clouds to my left which blocked my field of vision.  I never saw the traffic. Nor did I feel any wake/turbulence. I was never in the clouds. The air continued to be smooth.  Upon my return I was informed to contact the tower. I was then informed of a possible deviation.  I wasn't given a restriction to deviate from.For topics relevant - I was never given a heading; an altitude restriction; or informed of inbound traffic (at any point); by the ZZZ tower. I was on a climb and still below three thousand feet at the time of incident; therefore plus 500 did not apply.Prevention of recurrence - Aircraft departing airports that sit under a busy airspace should be given more attention; particularly when the departure direction keeps them engaged with multiple airspaces/special use areas; i.e. issue squawk code before clearance to takeoff.  Tower controllers should be informed of inbound / handoff traffic earlier.

The nose of the aircraft slide across the hold short line of [Runway] XXR. We advised Tower that the nose came across the hold short line. They issued an abort for a AC that was just issued a take off clearance on [Runway] XXR. The Tower thanked us for letting them know soon because the aircraft did not initiate the takeoff role. There was active snow and the hold short line and sine was covered in snow. As I preceded to stop the aircraft it was on ice so it slide to a stop just past the hold short line. The nose was between 5 feet to10 feet past the line The taxiing was difficult because of all the snow very slippery there were many times that the ac was slipping. It would have been nice if the taxi services were plowed and treated. The hold short sine was covered in snow and was difficult to see with the active snow.

ATC informed crew that [we would] have to remain at FL330 due to crossing traffic. After traffic passed overhead at approximately 2;000 feet above aircraft; ATC instructed [us] to climb and maintain FL370. At FL335 crew encountered the wake of the aircraft that had passed above. Aircraft snap rolled in a split second to an estimated 90 degrees to the right and pitched down 5 degrees. Crew recovered the aircraft extremely quickly and climbed to FL370. One passenger and aircraft technician were not buckled during the incident. No injuries or issues noted. Passengers were informed directly after encounter by the PIC as to what happened. Aircraft landed with further incidents. Maintenance team performed inspection for excessive G loading after landing as a precaution. Excessive G loading was not experienced during event. No damage was found.

On straight-out departure from CNO to ZZZ tonight just after sunset; I planned to climb to 2600 ft. MSL but misread the altimeter and leveled off at 1600 ft MSL. The dim lighting condition of the dusk and the shade on the altimeter due to the downward angle of my headlight were contributing factors. It was difficult to judge my altitude above ground when it is getting dark but not completely dark. As I approached Chino Hills; my GPS terrain warning system was activated which prompted me to re-check my altimeter reading and realized I was 1000 ft. below my planned altitude. I started climb out immediately and cleared the hills at 2500 ft. MSL. Although I may have stayed legal in this process by initiating the climb early enough before the rising terrain; the highest terrain in that area is ~1500 ft. MSL and I could have been involved in an accident if the error in my interpretation of the altimeter reading was not corrected promptly. In addition to cross checking instruments and pilot carefulness; an altitude check from the ATC (in this case the CNO Tower) acknowledging 'altitude 1600 ft.; frequency changed approved' if workload permits at dusk and night may be an additional preventative measure.

We had a smoke; odor & fumes event.This was not a A320 dirty socks event... on approach about 6;000 AGL I was notified of a faint electrical cord burning smell in aft cabin/galley area. I told the FA's (Flight Attendants) to keep me informed if it got worse and we would land in a few minutes.I was told upon arrival at the gate the FA's speculated it was probably smell from a passengers older laptop (FA's said faint electrical burn smell in back of aircraft that went away fairly fast). I speculated it was possibly pollution smell as we were on descent well below 10;000 ft.The FA's did report that they turned off the passenger charging ports when they detected the smell  I noted this in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry and report.No passengers or crew reported ill effects.Dispatch notified; Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry made; Smoke; Odor & Fumes form completed; and conference call with Maintenance Operations Center and [Checklist] completed upon arrival per Flight Operations Manual.

Drone lost link; no communication of this. Called ZZZ [TRACON] and they said it lost link. Recommendation- Communicate when a drone looses link.

We were flying a Visual Approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ. At about 1500 ft. MSL; Tower offered us Runway XXL; seemingly due to closeness of the aircraft in front of us. We were given 160 kts. until the marker; and had not configured to our final flaps (30). When we accepted Runway XXL; I 'went inside' and re-tuned to the Runway XXL Localizer. We made the 1000 ft. call; but had not fully configured. We got a 'Too Low; Flaps' alert and I selected flaps 30. I had 'tunnel vision'; focusing on the approach profile; which was normal; and didn't call for a go-around. We continued the approach and landing.Don't accept a runway change close in. We should have gone around when we got the alert. Aviate first; (complete configuring); then Navigate (I was distracted when I re-tuned and we really didn't need the new localizer to fly the visual); then Communicate (we both missed the Before Landing Checklist).

I arrived to work at XA00 for a midnight shift and assigned both North Control and CIC (Controller in Charge). Middletown Sector was staffed with a Controller only; not CIC capable in the Tracon. Prior to me signing on; Management was informed that one of the 4 midnight Controllers would not be in until XC00L. No Controllers or Supervisors were required to be held over to help out with the extraordinary departing traffic or TFR for the event. OSU; a Contract Federal Control Tower stayed open until XE00L; normally closes at XB00L; for the departing traffic. I also informed ZID Columbus sector that I had 35 departures proposed at XC00L and that it would be abnormal traffic for a typical [night]. They thanked me later that I informed them of the extra traffic as they help over extra Controllers to help them work the abnormal traffic. As a CIC; I had a report of a UAS in the TFR and was not able to relay the information to the DEN (Domestic Events Network) until 3 hours after the incident. Management should have been in the facility the entirety of the TFR to help with coordination. 3 Controllers for 3 positions as well as CIC is not a safe operation.

We were operating Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1; with a planned departure from Runway XX; due to the remaining runways being closed. Based on our performance calculations; we were legally and safely able to depart from that runway. We lined up on Runway XX and pushed up the thrust levers for takeoff. Just after commanding 'set thrust'; we received an aural alert stating 'CAUTION SHORT RUNWAY; SHORT RUNWAY'; as well as an EICAS message stating ' SHORT RUNWAY'. I immediately rejected the takeoff and retarded the thrust levers. We notified ATC; taxied clear of the runway; and found a spot to park the aircraft in coordination with ATC. After bringing the aircraft to a stop and completing the after landing checklist; I called the Duty Officer; who arranged a conference call with Captain. Based on their guidance; we temporarily selected the GND PROX RUNWAY OVRD switch to inhibit the RAAS (Runway Awareness and Advisory System) from giving us another alert on our subsequent takeoff. We completed the RTO checklist; as well as the after start and before takeoff checklist; verified our fuel was sufficient per the Flightplan/Release; and proceeded for another takeoff; which was uneventful. The RAAS on the B777 did what it was programmed to do; which is to alert the crew on a runway that has an available length of less than 7;500 ft. and the ground speed is greater than 40 kts. Runway XX at ZZZ has 7;278 ft. available. Not being familiar with this particular alert; I decided to reject the takeoff. I have never encountered this scenario in my six plus years of operating the B777; mainly because takeoffs on relatively short runways are rare; but I also do not recall seeing this scenario in any training environment. Maybe I missed it somewhere along the line; but it could be incorporated in a future syllabus.

On departure; [we] received [an] UNABLE RNP EICAS message. [We] believed [the message] to have been directly related to [a] local 5G NOTAM. Due to ATC informing us of [a] previous departure receiving effects of 5G-related malfunctions; [we] strongly believe this to be related to 5G near PDX. 5G near airports is a safety issue affecting automation and navigation.
