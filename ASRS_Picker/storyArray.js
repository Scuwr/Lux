After pushing back; start; and initial taxi on the ramp; we had not received final weights. Using radio 2; I called operations to get a status on the weights. I was also using radio 2 for CTAF advisories. After getting the final weights; we proceeded to taxi from the ramp onto Taxiway 1 for Runway XX (the runway of choice for inbound and departing transport and business aircraft). This route crosses active Runway YY/ZZ (the runway of choice for general aviation aircraft). Before crossing [Runway] YY/ZZ; we cleared both left and right; I made the call on the CTAF that we were crossing and crossed the runway. As we crossed; we saw a small aircraft already on the runway and possibly taking off. I didn't hear any calls on the radio and then realized I was still on the operations frequency. I made the advisory on the operations frequency and not CTAF. The small aircraft then taxied to the ramp from the approach end of [Runway] ZZ. I'm not sure if that aircraft aborted the takeoff or was simply taxiing to the hangar but it was an incursion nonetheless. The small aircraft was difficult to see and seemed to blend with the background buildings quite well. And coupled with my radio call error; we indeed had a runway incursion.

Aircraft X scheduled ZZZ to ZZZ1 departed [Runway] XXR and conducted a normal takeoff. Upon following the guidance of the MEL for single pack differed bleeds transfer; and after reducing N1 to 60% for the swap; a Left Pack HI Press Caution message on EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) and an associates Fault light on the Left Pack overhead panel appeared. The Captain (Pilot Monitoring) began the QRH for the associated message. The QRH procedure assumes the other Pack is operative; which for our plane was previously deferred; and as a result the aircraft was climbing out on the departure procedure in an unpressurized manner. The decision was to limit our final climb to 10;000 feet while working the problem. A Cabin Altitude Warning message appeared after the Left Pack HI Press QRH was completed. After completing all associated QRH and directed CFM procedures; it was determined that we would have to remain unpressurized and below an altitude that would allow for us to complete the flight segment to ZZZ1. Our fuel numbers suggested the best course of action was to return to ZZZ. After making the decision to return to ZZZ; we notified Dispatch and Maintenance Control via ACARS of the issue and plan to return to ZZZ. Our FA (Flight Attendant) was notified via his handset and briefed.The return flight required us to burn a little fuel to land under maximum landing weight; so we continued to maintain an altitude of 10;000 ft. to expedite the burn. The cabin temp reached as high as 35 Celsius during our flight. We landed back in ZZZ on Runway XXL and taxied to the gate without further incident.Deferred packs for ZZZ would be preferably fixed instead of deferred. Given the single pack taxi operations in summer weather; if a fix is not possible; maybe positioning the aircraft to fly northern rather than southern routes would be more comfortable for passengers.

On departure; [we] received [an] UNABLE RNP EICAS message. [We] believed [the message] to have been directly related to [a] local 5G NOTAM. Due to ATC informing us of [a] previous departure receiving effects of 5G-related malfunctions; [we] strongly believe this to be related to 5G near PDX. 5G near airports is a safety issue affecting automation and navigation.

Out of RNM; following RNM obstacle DEP PROC Runway 09. Tower requested switch to TRACON. Upon switching; sounded like female voice asked for ident. immediate ident broadcast; and no other transmission rec'd for Aircraft X. Reached 4k and started turn to hdg 330 when TRACON male voice indicated he rec'd a low altitude alert. Advised we were just beginning turn; and was given new hdg to 270. moments later; given new altitude of 5k; and ask to call TRACON as soon as practical. Remainder of flight unremarkable. Mild to moderate turbulence from takeoff to FAF at ZZZ.Phone call to TRACON; spoke to (male) Controller. Indicated the RNM obstacle DEP Runway 09 is 'watched' by TRACON very closely and it appeared we were not turning; requiring Controller to provide vectored deviations. Controller stated they have had many problems with this particular obstacle departure. Stated call was a learning tool for pilots; and he would file a report.Reviewed the obstacle departure procedure on the ground (again) and ADS-B data. We maintained a greater than 500 fpm climb; on the designated course (088) in medium turbulence; and began turn the moment we reached 4000 feet MSL. We believe the Controller may have changed positions and found us at that juncture; and was alerted and changed our course out of caution for our safety; based on previous issues (as the Controller had stated). We appreciate the concern and assurance of our safety by this Controller. We and the Controller agreed that this obstacle procedure requires updating to a safe and easy to understand format and route.This was both Pilots first experience using this RNM Runway 09 obstacle departure procedure and although felt we were inside the confines of the procedure; have now a heightened understanding of ATC focus regarding this departure; and most probably if flown again; request voca (over RNM); cross RNM at or above 5000 before proceeding on course; which would completely avoid the lower level terrain to the east.

We first noticed engine thrust surging during climb through 12;000 ft. The aircraft wasn't climbing at a normal rate. Then through 15;000 ft.; N1 on the number 1 engine was observed to be surging between approx 56% N1 and the climb target N1. We elected to level off at FL 190 to troubleshoot. This was difficult due to the absence of EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System) messages or abnormalities other than the N1 indications. The engine continued surging on and off for roughly 5 minutes between 56% N1 and the cruise target of about 79% before normalizing. A decision to request priority handling was made and along with our Dispatcher we elected to continue to ZZZ. The flight attendants were briefed on the situation. The rest of the flight was normal until initiating the descent at which time the number 1 engine surged again briefly and normalized again throughout the landing roll. Upon rollout ENG 1 NO DISPATCH EICAS message illuminated. The MX logbook entries were made and MX personnel met the aircraft at the Gate. I'll note that 2 MELs were present on the aircraft; ENG 1 short dispatch and engine 1 bleed system.

Noticed Captain's forward windscreen delaminating and arcing. A few seconds later; a loud pop; and the window shattered. It appears to be the outer panel. We begin the diversion to ZZZ and [requested priority handling]. There were no pressurization issues. We ran all QRH procedures and checklists and landed uneventfully in ZZZ.There wasn't anything we (the Crew) could've done to prevent this event. But; I was told numerous times yesterday that this event is happening 4-5 times a month.  Can you please tell me WHY this is happening?  This is potentially a very dangerous situation.  Why is it happening so frequently?

Window R1 (FO Windscreen) shattered. FL340 Mach .83 Captain (me) on break; FO and Relief Pilot flying. They ran the ECL checklists and at a natural break in the action called me to inform me of the event; according to our pre-break briefing. I came to cockpit and then they ran through the ECL/QRH again reviewing their action bringing me into the loop and up to speed. I then called Dispatcher via SAT phone requesting a conversation with him and Maintenance Controller. We observed only shattered outer glass pane; inner acrylic intact and stable. Maintenance reviewed our situation and then we formed our plan. We discussed (pilots; Dispatch and Maintenance) decided the situation was stable and proceeding to destination as flight planned was best option. We maintained FL340; informed ATC of situation with requested FL340 to destination. My FO and Relief Pilot followed the pre-break briefing by working the problem using the ECL and their experience to stabilize the situation. They efficiently and effectively followed established procedures. I reviewed their work and then we all discussed and reviewed the situation. I decided; considering their input along with Dispatcher and Maintenance that the best/safe course of action was to leave the airplane stable and continue to destination. Landed uneventfully.

Pulled up the front pit to raise the belt loader half way to jump in the pit to close the nets. After raising the belt loader half way; employee proceeded to engage the parking brake. However; belt loader malfunctioned and kept raising on its own. It ended up making contact with lower door lip. Employee lowered the belt loader to avoid further damage to the plane.  Employee informed his gate lead about the incident and asked him to put in the choke for the belt loader. Employee and the gate lead froze the scene and called in the incident.

I don't know exactly when this happened; but I believe it was sometime between XA:30 and XA:40 Eastern time. It may have been just a few minutes earlier.My student and I were coming back into ZZZ to land. We were told to expect XXR and were being brought to a left base for XXR (we were coming generally from the north). Runway XXL was also in use. We were being vectored by ATC and were maintaining 3;000 ft. MSL. The Approach Controller instructed us to 'fly heading 140; enter a left base for Runway XXR; descend and maintain 2;500 ft. for traffic'. I read this back while my student (the Pilot Flying (PF)) bugged the altitude and heading and initiated the descent. The controller then gave us the traffic advisory of a B737 at our 3 o'clock descending. I was looking for traffic but did not have visual on them. However; I did see them show up on our Multi-function Flight Display and this indicated they were below us. We were now level at 2;500 ft.. I finally got visual on the B737 off to our right as they were about to pass below us. They looked very close to us; but I never felt like we were in an unsafe position. I looked at the altimeter and it read 2;460 ft. or so. I took the controls to make sure we wouldn't descend any more and at that same time; we got a traffic advisory in our aircraft that indicated the traffic was 400 ft below us. We were on the assigned heading of 140. The rest of the flight continued as normal with no issues and we safely landed the aircraft.I really think the Approach Controller had us begin our descent just a little bit too early. Had we stayed at 3;000 ft.; we likely would not have gotten that TA. We probably would have needed to be vectored out a little bit further to ensure that we would have enough space to lose our altitude to land; but it could have prevented this situation. I think we should have had more of a buffer between the two aircraft. I also could have done a better job at making sure my student didn't drop that 40' down to 2460'; but I'm also not sure that that would have prevented us from getting the TA. If I had visual on the aircraft sooner; it's possible this would have been prevented but they were being covered by our wing so I couldn't quite see them until the last second.

Configured and flying jump run. The left wing appeared to have lost lift causing a spin. Aircraft control was recovered within 5;000 ft. While the event was happening; a couple of jumpers left the aircraft upon which some skin damage occurred. Was able to land the aircraft safely with the jumpers that remained on board. We had a loss of lift on the left wing; so it has stalled. After speaking with the Company; we are going to run the jump run at a higher speed.

Upon departing the FBO I taxied into a cone. The prop hit the cone with no decrease in RPM. Upon inspection of the prop and finding no issues I departed. The cone did not cause damage to any other aircraft or equipment. I was at an unfamiliar airport and did not receive the customary support from the FBO for parking or departure. However; the mistake was all my own and I plan to be more careful going forward.

We departed ZZZ and once at a positive rate; I called for gear up. Right as my First Officer raised the gear handle we encountered a bump of light to moderate turbulence. After the gear retracted we received a steering inop caution message. We climbed towards 10;000 feet and once we were on course; away from terrain and caught up with flying the airplane I transferred flight controls and radios over to my FO (First Officer). We checked the QRC then went onto the QRH and performed the checklist but were unsuccessful.We then discussed a plan and decided to continue to ZZZ1 and land on [Runway] XXC as it was the longest runway and the winds were favorable. At this point I returned to PF (Pilot Flying) duties. We asked ZZZ Center to forward our request to ZZZ1 for planning purposes and advised them we were not an emergency; then texted Dispatch and filled in the flight attendants.Once with ZZZ Approach they elected to provide priority handling for us and vectored us into [Runway] XXC. We came to a full stop on the runway; I set the parking brake and made a PA to advise the passengers that the ARFF vehicles were precautionary and we were working on a maintenance issue. The system reset procedure was successful so we cancelled our emergency and taxied clear of the runway.

About an hour out from ZZZZ we heard a muffled boom and air-frame vibration that lasted a couple of seconds. At which time we noticed a quick movement of the engine 1 gages. After that there was no vibration and the engine gages were all normal. Every thing was normal until the top of decent. On decent when the throttles went to idle the #1engine vib gage climbed to 3.7. When the power was brought back up the vib gage would drop down to .4 - .6. Ran the vibration check list which said if less then 4.0 continue as normal which we did. After landing we contacted [maintenance] at which time [maintenance] grounded the aircraft.

Had a flight today to ROA. As setting up to descend into ROA we got the weather and notams. Winds were favoring Runway 24 so we started to set up for the RNAV Y 24 approach. We briefed all the terrain; and reviewed the company pages again since this is an airport known for unstable approaches. Approach Control vectored us onto the final approach course and told us to maintain '4000' I believe until established on the approach course. The FAF altitude was 3700. The Captain was flying this leg; and disconnected the autopilot and was hand flying during the intercept. We maintained 4000 ft. until we were fully established and almost right on the snowflake. We started a gradual descent (roughly 500-800 fpm) to get to 3700. After the final approach fix we were doing a normal RNAV (CAMPA) approach. We were on the snowflake if not the slightest bit high; as we were visual and didn't want any aggressive descent rates due to the terrain. We were visual the entire approach. I can't remember exactly how far past the FAF we were but we got for a brief second the 'terrain' the light barely even flashed on the 'GPWS' button. When we looked down we weren't more than 1000 fpm if anything more of 600 slightly above the snowflake and we'll clear of all terrain. So we continued the approach as we were stabilized. After the brief aural 'terrain' and light flash we didn't get anything else; nor nothing from ATC. Don't know if it was a malfunction of the terrain detection system; but wanted to write this brief summary.

On an empty ferry flight DEN-ZZZ; we were climbing to 11;000 ft. as our final cruise altitude. With no passengers the aircraft was climbing about 2;500 FPM through 10;000 ft. Around that same time the ADSB Fail light illuminated; we were aware that there had been reported GPS failures in the area and we got distracted when the light illuminated. We made the 1;000 ft. to go call out but by the time we looked back at the flight instruments we were passing 11;000 ft. and I was hand flying. I immediately began to correct and level off; we reached 11;500 ft. before returning to our assigned altitude of 11;000 ft.The entire time the ADSB fail message was illuminated; we were in heading mode. The ADSB FAIL light was only illuminated for a few seconds.There were no GPS deviations only a brief altitude deviation. The flight continued successfully with no other deviations and the GPS was operational the rest of the flight.When DEN and ZZZ are departing and landing south this is a very short flight. We were busy with our normal flight duties and a bit rushed. When the ADSB FAIL light illuminated I got distracted. The empty airplane had a much higher climb [rate] than normal. Both these things combined caused a slight altitude deviation.[I should] prioritize the state of the aircraft over the brief GPS outage especially in a high AOV [Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service] area. As pilot flying I should have utilized automation rather than hand flying in times of high work load to prevent deviation and reduce workload.

We brought the aircraft into ZZZ that morning. After landing; we received a message saying 'LG NO DISPATCH'. (I noted the previous day there was a voided out write up of the same message.) Once we parked at the gate and shut down the engine and hydraulics; the message disappeared. However; the left main inboard brake was showing about 42 degrees while the outboard was showing 242 degrees. I decided to call it in and explain everything that happened. Maintenance Control said they will call contract maintenance because they think this is a break temperature sensor issue. I hold off on boarding until the issue is resolved in case it's something worse. Contract maintenance shows up; swaps out the sensor; which fixes the issue; grabs the maintenance logbook and goes to fill it out saying we are good to board. We board up; get the can back and it was showing what they did with it sign and dated. We close up; get permission to push back and we do. Halfway through pushing we pull up the take off data to load it into the MCDU; and it's showing 'aircraft out of service'. We set the brake and I call maintenance to ask what is going on. It is then they advice me there is an issue with the paperwork and we are not legal and to return to the gate until they get it corrected. We hang up; tell the FAs; passengers; ramp; Dispatch; and operations what is going on and we needing to return to gate. It takes about 15-20 minutes but we finally get parked back at our gate. I call maintenance again to get a better idea of the issue. They explain how contract Maintenance took the brake sensor off of another one of our aircraft; but messed up how they wrote it up in that aircraft's maintenance logbook; which is causing us to be illegal. We had no idea we were not legal until I called about the out of service message. Contract Maintenance came out; took our maintenance logbook. Once all the paperwork was in line; they brought back the logbook. There were no changes to our log book. We closed up and departed without further problems. When on a maintenance delay; we want to leave as soon as possible; but to prevent something like this happening again; we should check the takeoff data to verify no 'aircraft out of service' messages appear and that we receive numbers. Scenario like this; past departure time; we usually have the passenger count and the bag count before we are ready for it; (as long as it's auto close out) we can check to see if we are good or not.

VFR weather with winds 150 at 5 kts. while landing on 4R. An Airbus landed 3 miles ahead of us and another aircraft departed Runway 9. While on very short final; I was the Pilot Flying with the automation off and we hit some wake turbulence around 50 ft. AGL and experienced a rolling event. I added power and corrected the rolling event and then proceeded to land in the touchdown zone safely; but it was a longer landing than desired. After debriefing; my Captain and I both agreed it would have been better to go around and try the landing again.
