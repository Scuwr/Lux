FA's (Flight Attendants) needed to remove and check 7-8 bags from the aircraft; since we ran out of OHB space. FA's brought the bags to the boarding door. Unfortunately; the Agents did not ask any customer about spare lithium batteries being in their bags; as all the Customers were seated. There were no conversations with any of the passengers and their checked bags and the bags simply were tagged and sent to the ramp. This is not good as this created a safety hazard. Please ensure all Team Members follow procedure; most especially when it pertains to safety-related items and the integrity of the aircraft; as it did in this case. Friendly and continuous reminders are always helpful. In hindsight; I wish I would have informed the Captain about this at the time; but there was a lot going on: we had all these bags saturating the galley; it was near departure time; I had to go brief OWE's (Overwing Emergency Exit); etc. However; I'm not sure if that would have changed anything in the end anyway. I really truly wish we all were aware of procedures and followed procedures even when it might be inconvenient or we miss departure time. It is very difficult and challenging to confront Team Members asking them to follow procedure when we really shouldn't be having to ask them to; we should all know procedure and follow it without question instead of taking the easy way out. I share this with your Team in confidence: I did receive some pushback from a fellow FA when I mentioned asking those 7-8 passengers to go to the boarding door with their bags. I hope this remains confidential. Perhaps this is a good opportunity for us to remind each other of the need to always follow procedure regarding bags that need to be removed from the cabin due to lack of OHB space; most particularly on the A319/320 aircraft where space is always limited. I can't do everything myself :( Thank you for your continued help and support. Please let me know how I can help you as well.

We were to take Aircraft X to ZZZ from ZZZ1; the aircraft had a maintenance issue; the issue was said to be fixed in ZZZ1. In ZZZ1 when the engines were turned on my crew and I sensed and awful smell of vomit; we mentioned to the flight deck; the Captain said that was a normal smell since they were doing a fuel engine balance and oil check; so the smell was expected. During cruise to ZZZ the smell of vomit; mold and poop all combined persisted. We land in ZZZ; we tell the Captain about the smell and he said that was normal. Next day; we take the same aircraft; Aircraft X to ZZZ1 from ZZZ. When the engine started on the ground the smell in the cabin was just awful. The aircraft smelled dirty; like moldy; vomit; old cheese; poop what ever nasty smell you can think of; the aircraft smelled just like it. We again told the Captain and he said that was the smell that should be expected because the aircraft had the same problem. During cruising to ZZZ1; The smell became worse; it was so bad that my other crewmate FA4 (Flight Attendant) and I FA2 had to find a face mask to just bear the awful smell. I became nauseous; got a headache; and a burn and heavy sensation on my chest; all of the passengers that were sitting at the back of the airplane were complaining about the smell. Mind that myself being FA 2; I had to set up carts and prepare for a beverage service; consequently I was moving the most and since I was exercising; I believe that I was taking deeper breaths and the results was that I was mostly affected. However; since the Captain has been saying the whole time that the smell was expected; we seized to mentioned the problem. We landed at ZZZ1. The Captain doesn't say anything until I see two Mechanics onboard when we were deplaning. The Captain finally says that we had an oil leakage with a fume event during cruise and that he was having a hard time accessing his tablet to figure out the procedures. The First Officer complained the his throat was itchy; along with the other crew FA4. No one from the company showed up to ask if we were okay. I go directly to my manager to tell her what happens; she recommends that I go to the hospital. I get punished by the company with a sick call for going to the hospital because we still had two flights to work on. Three days later; I go to the hospital again with my joints hurting; headaches; and tiredness with inconclusive results with my white cells all out of whack; but not a sign of infection or virus. The flight deck along with the flight crew need extensive training about procedures and how to concretely recognize fume and odor event in the cabin. The flight deck also need extensive training and to listen to their cabin crew and to not put their personal needs before the cabin crew members and their passengers since the flight deck wear oxygen masks at all times. We; the cabin crew along with the paying passengers can occur health consequences with the dismissiveness; lack of procedural knowledge of the flight deck which in this case happened to us the cabin members and the passengers. I just hope that our passengers are okay and no adverse reaction occurred to their health since they have no knowledge of the event.

Aircraft X had a low speed rejected takeoff for takeoff configuration status message for rudder trim. I mistakenly did not realize that it was a Company event and they needed return to the gate for a rudder trim inspection; due to the rudder trim being at fault.Maintenance Operations Manager made we aware of the event and we tried to stop the aircraft from taking off; but we were unable to get them on ACARS in time.I was unaware that it was a Company event and I was reading the QRH CRJ-700 with the crew and the note said NOTE:After any RTO (Rejected Takeoff) greater than 80 knots; the crew must seek approval to continue from a Chief Pilot; Fleet Manager or Director of Operations.The best method to facilitate this communication is through Dispatch.All RTOs will be documented with a Safety Report. The speed that the crew said was only 50 knot when they performed the rejected takeoff.My mistake was just consulting the QRH and not the GMM (General Maintenance Manual) for the definition of a [event].

We were on a normal approach to Runway XXR in ZZZ. When we attempted to select flaps 25; the FLAPS TE DISAGREE EICAS illuminated and the flaps stayed at 20. We went around from approximately 1;000 ft. AGL and I ran the non-normal procedure while the FO (First Officer) flew the aircraft as were vectored back for a visual approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ. We completed the non-normal checklist; sent a quick ACARS message to Dispatch; talked briefly to the flight attendants to tell them we were landing very soon; and made a flaps 20 landing. Per ZZZ Maintenance; we left the flaps at 20 and wrote up the malfunction at the gate.

Climbing out of ZZZ on vectors between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 we got an EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) message FLT CNTRL/SPOILER ASYM. The F/O (First Officer) ran the NON-NORMAL CHECKLIST. Checklist said to land at nearest suitable airport. We considered dumping fuel; but we elected to land overweight considering the buffet in the controls and the fact dumping would take approximately 45 minutes. I was not comfortable taking more time considering the flight controls did not feel normal. On approach when the speed brake was armed we lost 5 knots on our VREF Speed. Aircraft had a shutter and rolled slightly to the left. I told the F/O to add power. He did and made a beautiful landing. The trucks were standing by. Dispatch and [maintenance] were consulted and notified.

Cabin pressure controller malfunction in-flight resulting in a cabin pressure reaching approx 8500 ft. We advised ATC and leveled off at FL230. We ran the QRH procedure which had us use normal mode. Normal mode was not effective and the cabin pressure continued to climb slowly. Upon reaching 9500 ft. of cabin altitude with approx 4 psi differential pressure; we initiated a descent and [advsied ATC]. Upon reaching 10;000; we coordinated with Dispatch and ATC then continued to ZZZZ. The cabin stabilized at approximately 2000 with the aircraft at 10;000 msl. We completed the QRH procedure and dumped the cabin pressure and continued the approach and landed without incident.

While doing the post flight walk around in ZZZ; the First Officer; Name; was notified by ramp personnel of a dent on the aircraft. He reported this to me and we both went out to inspect it. Although the dent was very small; it was there; and he must have missed it in his preflight. There were no markings anywhere around the dent that would be evidence of a previous write up and when comparing the DMIs (Deferred Maintenance Item) listed in the deferred log index; there were no write-ups that matched this dent either. So I made a logbook entry and called maintenance. This was the last flight of the day for the aircraft so I bypassed dispatch and called maintenance directly. I spoke with Name1 in maintenance and gave him the description of the dent. He informed me that they keep a longer list of previously reported and DMI dents that I don't have access to. Within a few seconds he found one the he thought matched it and he described the previously reported dent almost verbatim to how I had explained it to him. I thought it was strange that the dent was described almost identical to how I described it to him. I told him that I had already logged the entry in the AFML (Air Frame Maintenance Log) and he said that was fine; I could just void it. I told him I didn't feel comfortable voiding an entry that I had no way of seeing that it was previously written up for myself. While still on the phone; Name1 said to another technician in the background something along the lines of ' I have a pilot that doesn't want to do his job'. The other person told him to send me to the Duty Pilot. Before he even had a chance to say anything; I told him I would be more than happy to speak to the Duty Pilot. I felt like they were trying to intimidate me into clearing this entry. I was transferred to Name2; the Duty Pilot; and told him the situation. I told him I didn't feel comfortable clearing an entry just because Maintenance told me to without having access to this other book of previously reported DMIs. He told me that we do in fact keep another list of DMIs and that it's our policy to just clear the entry if we are told by maintenance that it's previously reported. He stated I need to have more trust with maintenance and that trust is in our guiding principles. I asked why they couldn't just have contract maintenance clear the entry as previously reported and he stated that contract maintenance was expensive. I reluctantly voided the entry. I had Maintenance and the Duty Pilot telling me to do so and I felt like the dent was insignificant and in my opinion; no safety threat. I immediately regretted doing this as I didn't believe that was the right way of handling the situation. If Maintenance is the one with access to this other book; I felt like they should be the ones to clear the entry. That way they are signing their name to the AFML; attesting that they confirmed it was previous damage and not new damage. I feel if their name was connected to that statement; they wouldn't be so nonchalant about it.While waiting for the van I ran this situation by one of our senior check airman that I greatly respect. He felt the same way I did and didn't think it was my responsibility to void the entry. I decided to call the Assistant Chief Pilot; Name3; to talk to him about it. Much to my surprise; Name3 immediately took the side of Maintenance and the Duty Pilot. He said much of the same things Name 2; the Duty Pilot; said but also said that as long as I follow the direction of Maintenance; on a recorded line; I remove responsibility from myself. I still didn't like it and continued to think about it. Although I hadn't mentioned this to anyone yet; I really didn't trust Name1; the original maintenance guy I spoke with. He came to the conclusion way to quickly that this was previous damage without asking very many questions at all and he described it to me almost verbatim as I had described it to him. He stated it was item #2 of what I believe he called'the dent an ding logbook'. At this point I had been at the hotel for about an hour and decided to call maintenance back. I spoke with Name4. I asked him if it was possible to get a copy of the dent and ding logbook page for item #2. This is what Name1 had said was the same dent that I had written up. I figured if I could see it for myself; I could rest easier. He agreed to this and emailed a copy of the page while I was still on the phone with him. Within seconds he realized that this was not the same dent that I had described based on the location. He looked for another possible entry and I sent him the pictures that I had taken. He sent me dent #8 in the logbook and it was quite obvious that this was also not the dent I had written up and then cleared. I realized this was a legitimate maintenance issue that I was talked into voiding it out by not only maintenance but the Duty Pilot and Assistant Chief Pilot. I informed Name4 that I was heading back to the airport to write it up again.There was a contract maintenance guy at the aircraft already mapping it out by the time I arrived. I added a second discrepancy worded the same as the voided entry and notified Operations. I believe the motivation to sweep this under the rug was financial and it's very concerning that the Duty Pilot and Assistant Chief Pilot were so quick to back up maintenance with little to no investigation on their end. I too am concerned with helping the company keep cost down but money should never overshadow safety. If Maintenance; the Duty Pilot and Assistant Chief Pilot are willing to pressure me; a Senior Captain and Instructor; they are definitely going to do this to junior captains. I feel this type of mindset is a safety problem and I wanted to make sure it is brought to light.

During cockpit flow; hydraulic systems pages appeared within normal quantity. Thirty minutes into the flight we received a HYD 2 LO QTY. The HYD 2 LO QRH was run. The quantity was at 16%; pressure 2;900 psi; and temperature around 28C. Upon contacting Dispatch and Maintenance via AIRINC; the decision was initially made to continue to ZZZ1 due to a suspected faulty sensor. During the discussion the HYD 2 quantity slowly fell to 0%. Roughly 5 minutes after the quantity was at 0% the HYD 2 pressure dropped from 2;900 psi slowly to 2;500 psi and then rapidly to 0 psi. At this point; Maintenance was in agreement that the HYD 2 SYS was lost. The decision was made to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ.Shortly after HYD 2 LOW PRESS EICAS appeared and corresponding QRH was completed. [Cabin Crew] was informed of the situation and code yellow. Customers were informed of the problem and of a return to ZZZ with roughly 20 minutes remaining in flight. During the descent with FO (First Officer) flying; the aircraft was configured at 300 kts.; autopilot on; descending through mid twenties at 2;000 FPM; on LNAV with a straight course. The aircraft was rolled sharply in an uncommanded right roll of 5-15 degrees. This occurred twice. AP TRIM MISMATCH was displayed and FO ran appropriate QRH. At this point the decision was made to hand fly the arrival and I took control to allow FO to review QRH and special considerations for landing. Aileron trim was used to compensate roll with maximum trim roughly 1.5 ticks to the right. Sudden unannounced rolls continued with the last being at around 200 ft. AGL. HYD SYS page was continuously monitored and it appeared rolls were linked to a surge in PSI which ranged from 0-1;000 psi. We had an uneventful flaps full landing on XXL. The left engine TR (Thrust Reverser) was deployed. Directional control was not a problem. Around 40 kts.; brake pressure increased unexpectedly and the aircraft jolted. Aircraft came to stop on XXL. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) inspected brake temperatures which were 260/30 30/460+. CFR cleared aircraft to be towed to Gate XX. Customers deplaned uneventful.

We landed on Runway 19 at MEI and during the left turn off the runway the Tower instructed us to exit at [Taxiway] Alpha 3 and left on [Taxiway] Bravo. We were abeam or past the taxiway sign for [Taxiway] Bravo so we continued straight ahead to the old now closed Taxiway Bravo. The Tower instructed us to stop and do a U-turn to the new [Taxiway] Bravo. We were not the first crew to have done this as I could see recent tire tracks and a broken taxi light on the old [Taxiway] Bravo. I have two suggestions. First; on the taxi chart we reviewed prior to landing the XXXX on the closed taxiway are faint. They do not stand out. They in fact are considerably less distinct than the oddly depicted airport perimeter fence or road. Why is the perimeter fence/ road on the chart? My second suggestion is wouldn't a sign or clear barricade prohibiting entry onto the old [Taxiway] Bravo be better. There is a yellow X on the ground but by the time you see it you are already on the taxiway with not much of a option to turn around. Lastly the entire issue could have been avoided if the Tower had said; exit at [Taxiway] Alpha 3 and make the 'FIRST' left onto [Taxiway] Bravo. That one additional word would have saved us all.

I am writing this report because I am deeply concerned about fatigue and the crisis that is upon us. I never thought this would be an issue at (Company); but here we are. Decades ago I flew for a Regional Airline that operated under the assumption that FAA limits were normal operating procedure. They didn't recognize that FAA limits should be viewed as the boundary; not the normal way of operating. Unfortunately; decades later (Company) is doing the same thing that lousy Regional Airlines did. Most Pilots at this Regional could not wait to get out of there for this reason. The best way to describe FAR 117 to anyone that isn't a Pilot is to associate it to food. FAR 117 is the same as really really bad food. It's the kind of food you eat out of desperation; because it's better than starving; however; it's awful. Once in a while; sure I get it; I need to eat it. However; we are at a point where Crew Scheduling is handing out bad food on a regular basis. There is only so much bad food we are willing to eat before we seek out a better alternative; and that is called fatigue. Example; just this weekend I was scheduled to fly a 12 hour 55 minute duty day after a 12 hour overnight. When the Scheduler gave me this whopper (normal these days); I told him that many things had to go right for this day to go as planned; considering I only had 35 minutes of leeway before I became illegal. His response? It's legal; we will deal with it if it doesn't work out. Well; it failed miserably. We landed in ZZZ1; just prior to a thunderstorm and of course I became illegal to fly my last leg. Their solution? Deadhead on that flight; which the aircraft had diverted; so there was no telling how long it would be before that flight pushed. About 4 hours later; while waiting for this flight; they called again and said I was illegal to deadhead. Now they wanted me to go to the hotel for another 11 hour overnight after being on duty for 13 plus hours. I asked for a later deadhead the next day so I could recover from this beast of a day; and the response again was its legal; we don't have to do that.  It took arguing with a Supervisor for them to understand why I wanted a longer overnight. I was fatigued and I knew that the next day I would probably be asked to fly instead of deadhead and 11 hours of rest wasn't going to cut it. They finally conceded and I got a longer overnight. This is the fourth time in the last two months where scheduling has tried to back me into a corner and I have called fatigue. There are Pilots out there who are just doing what Scheduling is asking them to do and there is no way it's a Safe operation. I hope whoever reads this; sounds the alarm over at Crew Scheduling. The Company claims we are calling fatigue and sick too much; yet if the Company doesn't change its Crew Scheduling process; the problem will only get worse. Summer is coming.

After taking off from ZZZ-ZZZ1; we were not able to retract the landing [gear]. At around 35 feet with positive rate after calling for gear up; I tried to put the landing gear lever in the up position and was unsuccessful. We notified ATC and told them what had happened and that we wanted to level off at 3;000 feet and get some vectors so we can complete our required checklist. We ran the QRH and decided to return to ZZZ because there was no (LG WOW SYS FAIL MESSAGE DISPLAYED) so the QRH directed us to land at the nearest suitable airport. We completed the QRH and notified Dispatch of our intentions. We also briefed the flight attendants and passengers about the current situation. We never [requested priority handling] or gave any brace commands because the QRH never called for it and furthermore everything was under control and completely safe. While returning back to ZZZ; I suggested that we held for a few minutes to burn off some fuel and avoid an overweight landing. Once we were below max landing weight; we decided to contact ATC for the ILS XX. We landed without any further incident. On the ground we informed Dispatch and Maintenance Control of what occurred and Maintenance responded that they already knew because their system indicated there was something wrong with the nose wheel sensor. We briefed the Gate Agent and passengers and told them that there will be a replacement aircraft landing soon. After we swapped aircraft we departed without any further incident.

After departure we saw that the rpm was less than 2200 RPM and the climb rate was less than 200 FPM. Due to that situation; we decided to turn back to join the traffic pattern and land back at the airport. After we landed; the engine was almost about to quit on the landing ground roll. We taxied back to the company ramp and squawked the airplane for maintenance inspection.

After block in at ZZZ the Lead Flight Attendant came up to the Flight Deck and said we had a pretty strong Odor coming from the Forward Gallery area that smelled like jet fuel. She said the Odor began just before we lowered the landing gear on approach into ZZZ and dissipated as we were taxiing to the gate. Both Flight Attendants described the order as being 'Strong and a bit irritating'. Maintenance Control was then notified; and logbook entry was made as well as a Fume/Odor report. A mechanic was quick to meet us at the gate and was briefed.

I was the Pilot in Command. I was going to conduct a solo cross country from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 to ZZZ3 and return to ZZZ1. I conducted my pre-flight check in accordance with the Pilot's Operating Handbook. I did not discover any issues. I then contacted ZZZ1 Ground Control and requested and was approved for my run-up. I proceeded to the north end of Alpha 1 to conduct my run-up. I conducted my run-up in accordance with the POH and again did not discover any issues. I had no difficulty in taxing from the FBO to the run-up area. I obtained clearance from ZZZ1 Ground Control to proceed to Runway XX and hold short. I again did not experience any difficulty in taxing from the run-up area to the holding area of Runway XX. I contacted the ZZZ1 Tower and advised them I was holding short of Runway XX. The Tower cleared me to proceed to Runway XX and take off to right traffic.I taxied onto Runway XX and proceed to take off and climb. The airplane immediately began to yaw to the left despite my using the right rudder pedal to compensate for the left turning tendency caused by the P-factor; but the airplane continued to yaw to the left. I reached an altitude of approximately 1;400 ft. and began a 30-degree right turn. The airplane continued to become unstable. I noticed the ball in the turn coordinator was all the way to the right. I applied more right rudder to correct but the airplane but it to the left and then right. The rudder pedals weren't responsive to my input to control the yawing. I was experiencing difficulty in maneuvering the airplane and staying in a straight and level flight at which time I felt it was in my best interest to return to ZZZ1. I contacted the Tower and advised them that I was experiencing rudder control and needed to immediately return. Tower asked if I could do return and land on Runway XY. I advised Tower that I didn't believe I could affect a turn and land on Runway XY and would attempt to land on Runway XX. I entered the right pattern for a landing on Runway XX and continued to have difficulty maintaining a straight and level flight. I paralleled Runway XX (Downwind). I decreased the RPM from 2350 to 1700 when I was aligned with the north end of Runway XY. I then attempted a 30 degree right turn onto base when I was 45 degrees with the numbers for Runway XX and began my decent. I was having difficulty effecting the turn and turn for the final for Runway XX.I overshot and approached Runway XX at 45-degrees. My airspeed was 85 KTS. I was aware this to 10 KTS over the approach and recommending landing speed. I considered a go-around but didn't believe I would be able to safely do so. I reduced the power to idle as I entered the runway; brought the nose up to reduce airspeed; landed hard on the rear wheels; bounced up and came down on the front wheel and began to porpoise. I again; did not believe I could effectively increase power and safely do a go-around once I began to porpoise. I taxied back to the FBO and reported the incident to the office personal and the mechanics. I was unaware until informed by the owner and operator of the FBO that I had a propeller strike.I have approximately 85 hours of dual instruction flight time and 4 hours solo and never experienced this type of airplane instability with my instructors or since I began soloing. This was my second time flying this aircraft. I familiarized myself with this aircraft previously and on this date prior to departing the FBO. This was flight was to be my second cross-country flight. My prior flights with my instructors and since soloing have been without incident.

While on the ILS Runway XX at ZZZ1 I selected flaps 30 but the flaps did not extend past 25 degrees. We executed a missed approach and due to the wet runway and wind shear conditions we diverted to ZZZ2. We ran the FM procedures; notified Dispatch and briefed the flight attendants on the plan. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ2 Approach. We executed the ILS Runway XXR to ZZZ2 to an uneventful full stop. During the ILS Runway XXR the flaps operated and indicated normally and we landed with flaps 30. Maintenance inspected the aircraft and returned it to service. We continued to ZZZ1 within our duty day to a normal landing at ZZZ1.
