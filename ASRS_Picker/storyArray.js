While in flight at level cruise at FL320; I was in the bunk in the rear of the aircraft when I noticed a power reduction. Immediately afterwards; the seat belt sign illuminated and I made my way to the flight deck. There was a FLAPS DRIVE EICAS with an expanded flap display indicating that the right mid-span leading edge flap deployed. As a result the airspeed band became very tight between Mmo and the yellow band as the FMC wanted to honor the maximum flap extension speed. This was in close proximity to our stall speed. The auto throttle was disconnected and the Pilot Flying manually maintained Mach. 75. We consulted with the company via sat-phone and were advised to return to ZZZ. We coordinated with ATC for the return and fuel dump. An uneventful landing was made below MLW.

During cruise flight; a small fuel leak was observed over the top of the wing. It didn't appear to be substantial; but was still a cause for concern. A direct routing to the airport was established. No diversion was performed because the descent for the destination airport had already started and the engine monitors indicated normal operations. After a few minutes; the fuel leak no longer was showing signs over the top of the wing. The engine; as a result; was not shut down. A landing was made and engines were quickly shut down after clearing the runway. Upon exit of the aircraft; the leak underneath the wing which was not visible in flight was substantial. Inspection determined that a fuel bladder had ruptured.

Aircraft XI received a turnover from 1st shift on Aircraft X. The left inboard fuel tank plate was leaking. Access door XXXXX opening. When I removed the interior plate the rubber gasket was stuck to the inside of the wing structure and had a 5 inch strip of cracked and dry sealant that to me was the cause of the leak. I installed a new gasket IAW with the AMM and installed the plate. Leak check was good when fuel was transferred into the center tank. I signed off the job on log page X.I have not replaced many fuel panels. I had confirmed the tank hole for the write up but was unaware that the plate number for the opening should be confirmed to match.(The AMM does not suggest this.) I realized this after the aircraft came back with the same issue. I had indexed the plate on removing it so it would not be reinstalled incorrectly. Unfortunately the wrong plate was installed previously and I did not catch it on the reinstallation. The index point (door key) was deformed previously so the tank seemed to fit with no hesitation. In my limited experience if a plate is installed incorrectly the then the door key will not let you place the plate in the cavity.  It appears  the plates for XXXXX and XXXXY were switched at a previous installation. (It was found that the other wing had the same for the two innermost tank plates - XXXXZ and XXXXA) I also found that the plates with fuel sticks have a decal in front of the plate as well. Again not referenced to check this in the AMM. I will be suggesting a tech ops training video on fuel tank removal and reinstallation techniques for our various fleet types at The Company. I had looked while performing the job and there is not one referencing this. I will also be following the fuel pressurization procedures to the letter- as opposed to the 'Norm' of simply filling the tank and checking for leaks. I would say the dirty dozen aviation maintenance gotchas on this would be lack of knowledge; lack of resources; pressure and norms. I've learned not to assume any part was put into an aircraft correctly by a previous Technician.

After departing ZZZ1; at XA05 and landing at ZZZ; at XB18 my First Officer; and I listened to the ASOS at ZZZ 3 times before landing and it was reporting the wind at 260 degrees at 15 kts. gusting to 27 kts. The maximum crosswind for a Citation Ultra is 20 kts. Runway heading at ZZZ is 295 degrees; 35 degrees off the nose of a 27 kt. wind equals a 15 kt. crosswind component; well within the maximum of the 20 kt. crosswind for a Cessna 560. After completing the before landing check list we listened to the ASOS one more time and there was no significant change. Upon touching down on the runway the airplane weather vaned to the left from wind striking the vertical stabilizer and there was not enough right rudder to keep the airplane on the runway. After rolling through the grass for about 500 ft. I was able to taxi back onto the runway and taxi the airplane back to our hangar. No runway lights were damaged by our airplane.

Nose gear failed to retract on departure. Flew out to south of ZZZZ and held and ran checklist for Gear Disagree. Burned fuel down to Maximum Landing weight. Extended gear as we departed the hold. All indications normal. Landed normally about 2000 lbs. Below maximum landing weight. No mayday was declared. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was in place on landing. Flight cancelled. First Officers did an exceptional job.

Rolled onto runway for take-off once given our clearance from tower for take-off. Both my student and I heard the audible CAS (Crew Alert System) message warning and noticed the red temperature warning on cylinder number three. We then rejected our take-off and announced with Tower that we would be taxiing off the runway. Once off the runway we contact Ground and alerted Ground that we would be shutting our engine down to avoid damaging our engine. We requested assistance from the ground crew; I called our Maintenance Manager who was on duty and request that they bring the cart to tow the airplane back to our hanger.

We were scheduled to take passengers out of EGE. The initial clearance we received on the ground was to depart Runway 25 and climb via the BEVVR 1 departure RUBAY transition; the top altitude of which is 15;000 ft. We briefed our plan A and B; and the Captain made special emphasis on cleaning up the aircraft at 7;000 ft. (slightly above our normal level off altitude of 400 feet). We took off Runway 25 and made the turn to COPER. During the climb I was slightly late (about 50 feet) on making the 7;000 foot call out; so the Captain called it out and we cleaned up the aircraft. Around 8;300 feet; Tower called and advised us to maintain 10;000 feet; contact Center. I don't remember if it was Tower or Center; after checking in with them that told us to expect higher shortly. I set the altitude selector to 10;000 ft.; called out '10;000 set and 9;000 climbing 10;000.' Looking back I don't remember if the Captain acknowledged my call outs as required by our SOPs. This should have been an indication to me to verify the altitude with him again and to check with Tower to confirm the instructions. I called Center and advised that we were '9;000 climbing 10;000.' We had the TAWS page up prior to take off and we could see the terrain visually. We were in the black the whole time and didn't received any sort of TAWS alert. We leveled off at 10;000 and maintained the speeds required by the departure while we waited for a higher altitude as we had been previously advised. Between BEVVR and APRES we received a low altitude alert from Center and were cleared to FL260. Center advised us that the MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude) in that area was 13;100 ft. and told us that there was a required climb gradient on the SID for a reason. We of course began our climb to FL260; advised Center that we had been assigned 10;000 ft. and asked them to mark the tapes and provide us with a phone number so we could call once we reached our destination. I still don't know if the Tower Controller had misspoke or if I had misheard the altitude instruction; but a lapse of communication took place somewhere. I should have questioned the unusual altitude assignment with the controller and verified that the Captain heard the same instructions as I had.

We landed on Runway XX ZZZZ. As soon as we started to turn around for the back taxi; we heard tower communicate to the first of two Caravans on short final to prepare for a go-around. The response from the Caravan was 'Plenty of time'. Both my First Officer and I were unsettled to say the least as we turned the aircraft around and went head to head with the landing aircraft. I expedited towards Taxiway 1 but ATC correctly decided this was getting too close and told the Caravan to 'go-around.' The Caravan responded 'Still plenty of time.' and continued his approach. ATC instructed him a second time to 'go-around' and after a long silence the Caravan responded 'we still have time'. It was at this moment that I became concerned for our safety. The Caravan was on about 1/2 mile final 300 feet above the Runway as I stated to turn onto taxiway 1. I quickly exited the runway as ATC strongly commanded the Caravan to 'go-around' for the third time and the Caravan complied.

Shortly after takeoff; the CA (Captain) and I heard an unusual sound coming from the lower forward fuselage. While conducting After Takeoff cleanup items; we noticed the EQUIP annunciation light was illuminated. We ran the QRH checklist and determined the aircraft wasn't pressurizing. We called Departure; advised them of our situation; and requested to return to ZZZ RNAV XX. Approximate weight was 142;000 lbs.; so we were below maximum landing weight. Everything was uneventful; we landed and went to Gate XX shortly after landing.Upon arrival at the aircraft we noticed the #1 IDG was disconnected; MEL was properly annotated in the logbook; switches were placard. The APU would have to be online for the entire flight. Thus; we would have the DRIVE annunciation light illuminated during the flight. It's possible we missed the EQUIP light on the overhead panel thinking it's was the DRIVE light due to its close proximity. Thoroughly scan the overhead panel during the system annunciation recall.

Aircraft X on arrival from ZZZ-DEN flying the ZZZZZ RNAV Arrival on XXR transition but then updated to a visual approach for Runway XXL.  ATIS information warned of ADS-B and GPS issues around DEN airport.  Approximately 10nm North of ZZZZZ1 at approx 15;000 feet got 'GPS Primary Lost' FMGC indications for both Captain and First Officer as well as loss of EFB location information.  Shortly thereafter got NAV ADS-B FAULT Channel 1 and Channel 2 and NAV TCAS FAULT alert message.  After about 30-45 seconds GPS PRIMARY was restored and alert messages cleared on their own.  30-45 seconds later the pattern repeated.  Visual with the airfield I elected to disengage autoflight and auto thrust to fly manually.  The alert message pattern continued for 3-4 cycles until Captain opted to select 'EMER CANCEL' on the alert message system to stop the distraction of multiple repeating alert messages.  Multiple aircraft on DEN Approach radio frequencies reported similar issues in the general area.  It was enough that DEN Approach Controller began broadcasting a warning to all aircraft on his frequency to expect ADS-B and GPS interference problems.After landing the Capt and I informed maintenance at the gate but did not submit a write-up.  We agreed that with so many other aircraft in the area reporting the same issues on approach frequencies and the ATIS warning this was almost certainly an airspace/airport problem and not an aircraft system problem. As of this morning DEN ATIS reports 'GPS; TRANSPONDER; ADS-B ANOMALIES REPORTED IN THE DENVER AREA.' [Our location was] 10nm North of ZZZZZ1 on ZZZZZ RNAV Arrival.

On the night of DATE; I was responding to a gate call for A/C X parked at gate; ZZZ to ZZZ1; for the following write up created by the pilot; log X at XA:47 'NUMBER 1 ENG FIRE HANDLE DOES NOT ILLUMINATE DURING FIRE TEST'. After initial T/S (Trouble Shooting); I confirmed the fault; and after talking to the lead of [the zone] over the phone; he told me to request an MEL; because the fault was intermittent and could not be cleared. I initiated the request for MEL. While I was in the process of doing so; I accidentally cleared the log page X @ XB:30; instead of deferring it; which was just discovered when I was speaking with M/C (Maintenance Control); over the phone. M/C then told me to open another log and resubmit it. I open the log page Y @ XC:36 'NO 1 ENGINE FIRE HANDLE DOES NOT ILLUMINATE'; but I was not able to submit the MEL; still talking with M/C over the phone asking for help in resubmitting the MEL; M/C said that the aircraft was maintenance released and he could not help any longer. Immediately I called the lead back and asked him if he was the person whom released the aircraft. He replied that the aircraft was released by the Zone Supervisor; maintenance release X @ XD:33. At this point; the crew probably saw the maintenance release been printed and advised the ramp to start pushing the aircraft and they left the gate. I went after the lead to let him know that the aircraft was leaving and I did not have a chance to apply the MEL; because the maintenance release was issued and the aircraft brakes had been released. When I walked into the Supervisor's office the lead was talking to the supervisor for a swap for [the aircraft]; because the deferral for the MEL would take too long; the Supervisor was on the phone; asking for a swap when [they were told] that the aircraft had departure. Supervisor told me to contact M/C and ask for help. I contacted M/C but nothing could be done while aircraft was in the air. Aircraft X landed safely at ZZZ1 and log Y was cleared @ XE:50. This is how I remember this incident to the best of my knowledge.

After block in at ZZZ the Lead Flight Attendant came up to the Flight Deck and said we had a pretty strong Odor coming from the Forward Gallery area that smelled like jet fuel. She said the Odor began just before we lowered the landing gear on approach into ZZZ and dissipated as we were taxiing to the gate. Both Flight Attendants described the order as being 'Strong and a bit irritating'. Maintenance Control was then notified; and logbook entry was made as well as a Fume/Odor report. A mechanic was quick to meet us at the gate and was briefed.

On Day I was hired to take photos of a residential home in Location. The location of the home was about XXX miles away from my home. On my way to the location; the realtor sent me the location of the home. Once I located the house I realized that it was near the airport. Having been so far from home; I made a choice to fly the drone to take photos of the property to have to avoid a return XXX mile trip. I was aware of the location so I stayed at a low altitude and made sure to complete the operation with a few minutes. Due to previous issues in the past requesting permission to fly near that airport; I had trouble requesting access to fly; to which I assumed it would be difficult again. I flew right above the tree line and was finished in about 5 minutes to avoid any possible safety issue with manned aircraft.

I was doing pattern practice on 25R at ZZZ having completed six circuits.  On my 7th approach and landing holding the center line required full left rudder.  On touchdown I didn't release enough rudder causing the nose wheel to alternatively skip and grab making directional control difficult.  We ran out of rudder authority and departed the runway to the left (slightly) at intersection Charlie and clipped a sign inflicting damage to the sign and left wing.The left wing leading edge suffered a dent with a small hole in the center.  Damage was limiting to the sheet metal surface (leading edge) in line with the left main wheel. Close inspection shows no internal damage; superficial sheet metal damage only.

It was a normal flight up to the point that the Cabin Altitude Warning Light and Horn went off. It was less than five seconds before we had O2 masks on. We established comms and then Captain began coordinating for lower altitude while I started a controlled descent based on the fact that the cabin altitude and cabin rate weren't pegged. While working through the QRC/QRH the pressurization stabilized while descending and we elected to level off at 26;000 feet instead of 19;000 feet; which was our clearance.With the cabin pressure returning to around 6;000 feet; we elected to stay on O2 for a little while longer to allow for faster recovery from hypoxia symptoms. Checked the weather in ZZZ (VMC) and confirmed fuel requirements and elected to continue to ZZZ basted on the time en route; fuel requirements and weather at the field. I had symptoms of hypoxia almost immediately; which included tingly skin; chest tightness; heavy arms; light headedness; and a sinus headache. Most symptoms subsided within 20-30 minutes; but the headache lasted for several hours. We landed without further incident at ZZZ.

Cancun possible taxiway incursion and FA injuryAfter pushback from gate; we were issued taxi instructions to taxi to 12L via B-C follow Aircraft X. First Officer (FO)  acknowledged the instructions and I read them back to him. We began a slow taxi as we elected to single engine taxi to the runway. Aircraft X we were told to follow was already well ahead of us. As we passed C7 the FO started the number one engine. FO stated the delayed engine start was complete. I turned right on E3 and continued to follow Aircraft X. As I made the turn I noticed an Aircraft Y pushing between us and Aircraft X we were following (maybe gate 54). Aircraft Y appeared to be stopping as we approached but then appeared to continue to push. It looked like there could have been a possibility of us being in their way and wasn't sure if the push crew could see us. None of Aircraft Y pushcrew seemed to be looking at us. At the same time ground called us and told us we were supposed to stop at E1 and call the other west ground to continue. I can assure you that I never heard this clearance given and neither did FO. This happened at the same time as I became very uncomfortable with the proximity of Aircraft Y. I applied firm brakes and stopped the airplane suddenly. I am not sure how fast I was going but believe I was going less than 10 kts.  The East Ground Controller told us to contact the West Ground. We did so.  The new Ground Controller issued us instructions to continue if we could maintain clearance. The wing walker from Aircraft Y assisted us by giving a thumbs up as we proceeded past Aircraft Y. The FO also mentioned that our wingtips were well clear of conflict.  I called the flight attendants and asked if everybody was ok. The Flight Attendant [FA] who answered said they were seated already for takeoff and ok. We took off shortly after that. About 15 minutes into the flight; I called the flight attendants and mentioned that it was all clear to get up as I briefed them to stay seated until I called due to the weather in the area. The lead [FA] called right back and said that when I abruptly stopped the airplane; FA was still up and securing the galley during the taxi and bumped her head and back.  The lead FA said FA was just going to stay seated for a while as she was not feeling well. The lead FA also mentioned that FA took some [medication].  I queried the lead FA if she or FA felt a need for MedLink. She assured me that was not necessary.  After a few minutes the lead FA called again and told me that FA got up and continued her duties. I spoke with FA later in the flight and she tried to assure me that she was ok but needless to say I feel completely responsible and terrible about the situation. I did not intend to stop the aircraft so quickly but did feel compelled to cause our aircraft to hit each other.  FA [and] the lead FA continued to assure me that she was fine and had no intention of reporting the issue.
