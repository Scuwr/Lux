Aircraft was operating on an IFR flight plan in visual meteorological conditions to conduct a series of practice instrument approaches. The aircraft was supplied by the pilot flying who was the PIC and sole manipulator of the controls during the flight; and the sole operator of the radio communications with ATC. My role was to provide evaluation and instruction as necessary for the purpose of the flying pilot to obtain the certification of Instructor Pilot.  The flight was planned as a round robin flight originating at ZZZ and ending at ZZZ.  Intermediate approaches were planned at GCY; TRI and MOR. After completing a practice approach at GCY (a non towered airport) the flying pilot had reestablished radio contact with TRI Cities approach as instructed during the execution of the missed approach procedure. The pilot flying requested a practice ILS approach for Runway 23 at TRI.  TRI Cities advised the flying pilot to expect that approach issued vector instructions for ILS 23 at TRI. Radio traffic was extremely light and several minutes passed between communications between the controller and any other aircraft on frequency. While following a vector on the right downwind the pilot flying was instructed to contact approach on a different frequency. The pilot flying changed the radio frequency in use and reported on the new frequency.  The flying pilot was busy checking the ATIS as well as setting the TRI Tower frequency into standby on Com 1. Additionally the flying pilot was executing a partial panel approach with a simulated PFD (primary flight display) failure. As the aircraft reached a point a few miles from the anticipated right base vector I became concerned we hadn't heard a subsequent radio call and queried the flying pilot to verify he hadn't switched us off the correct frequency. After reviewing the approach chart he discovered he had made an entry error in the avionics. The pilot flying switched to the correct frequency and immediately advised ATC he had inadvertently been on the wrong frequency. ATC advised him he was below the MVA and instructed him to climb 600' and turn left to avoid terrain.  The pilot flying immediately acknowledged and complied with ATC's instructions. We were operating in VMC and had more than 1000' of clearance to any terrain or obstacle within several miles of the aircraft. At no time was the aircraft in danger of imminent collision with any terrain or obstacles.  ATC advised the pilot flying of possible pilot deviation due to operation of the aircraft below MVA while on an IFR fight plan. Post flight debrief discussion and review revealed the pilot read back the correct frequency; but incorrectly entered the frequency in the avionics. Neither the pilot flying or myself realized ATC did not acknowledge the pilot's frequency change. Intercom communication as well as the pilots approach and landing workload interfered with early identification of the data error.  A contributing factor was the unusually quiet radio communications with any other aircraft during the early vectors. This resulted in the pilots not immediately noticing a state of change with the current communications with ATC. In the future no frequency change will be assumed to have been correctly made unless positive acknowledgment by ATC has been received. I was not making the radio calls; and my expectation bias led me to believe the pilot flying would have made a subsequent verification call if he had not received acknowledgment of a correct frequency switch.

Was flying VFR on a sightseeing trip around Michigan and had a near miss with a small hobby drone that was far higher than allowed. I (the PIC) did not spot the drone but it was spotted by the passenger sitting in the right seat. The passenger described the drone as being close enough to see the individual rotors clearly (it seems to have been the common four rotor type of drone similar to the ones sold by DJI) and could make out the individual lights on the drone clearly). The aircraft I was flying was at 2;500 ft MSL at the time (roughly 1;800 ft AGL). The passenger's guess was that the drone was within 100 feet vertically (below) and 200 feet horizontally (to the right). Note that the passenger is not a pilot but that the passenger being close enough to make out the individual components of the drone would indicate that it was very close. Despite my scan for traffic; I was not able to spot the drone before or after the encounter. The passenger said he only saw it because he happened to be looking in the right direction at the right time. From my understanding drones are limited to 400 feet AGL; this drone was far higher than that and in violation of the regulations. Many drones now feature a software limit to prevent them from flying higher than that which would suggest that the drone was purposefully flashed with software intended to break the height regulations.

Ferry flight; ZZZ2-ZZZ3. Aircraft X. Roughly 8 minutes after takeoff; BLEED TRIP OFF light illuminated. Run the QRH and finally directed us to turn off the affected side PACK; which was the left pack. Few seconds after turning off the left PACK; the right PACK light comes on. We were cleared by ATC for FL280; at that moment stopped at FL200 and Request descend and back to ZZZ1.We were cleared direct to ZZZ1 and decent to 10;000 ft. by ATC. We read the check list for right PACK light ;while we were on the check list; Cabin Altitude warning horn activated during descend; CABIN ALT exceeded above 15;000 ft. and passenger oxygen masks deployed. We read the check list for (Cabin altitude or rapid decompression) we use oxygen mask until 10;000 feet. Didn't [request priority handling] because situation was on the control.We didn't see any PACK overheat indication on the ground and before takeoff. Approximately 8 minutes after takeoff we noticed with the first indication which was left BLEED TRIP light followed by right PACK light. Had 45 minutes ground stop in ZZZ2. PACK was running for cooling purposes and cause PACK overheat in flight.We decided to stop climbing at FL200; and run the check list for left BLEED TRIP light. Eventually QRH directed us to shut down the left PACK; immediately after that the right PACK light comes on; at that point we decided to request descend to lower altitude and back to ZZZ1. We definitely need some equipment on the ground to keep the airplane cool during summer especially in hot airports.

After takeoff from ZZZ while climbing through 11;000 ft MSL; the First Officer and I smelled smoke and noticed a smoky haze in the cockpit. We then received a call from the A-Flight Attendant who said there was smoke in the cabin. We leveled off at 14;000 ft and [requested priority handling] with Center and received vectors back to ZZZ. I asked the First Officer to run the Smoke; Fire or Fumes Non-normal checklist while I flew the aircraft; talked to ATC and text messaged Dispatch through ACARS. After we turned off the galley power switches; the smoke seemed to dissipate. I asked ATC to have the Fire Department standing by upon arrival. While being vectored for the ILS to Runway XXR I checked in with the Flight Attendants to verify that the smoke was dissipating in the cabin and they assured me it was. We landed uneventfully. After landing I checked with the Flight Attendants again and asked if they saw any reason to evacuate; they said no; the smoke was almost gone. We decided to taxi to the gate where we deplaned and called Dispatch and Maintenance. We were unable to determine the source of the smoke.

During the descent on the arrival into ZZZ we got an AIR BLEED 2 abnormal ECAM. I flew the plane and the captain followed the procedure. About 5 minutes later around 9000-10000 ft. the engine page appeared on the ECAM and the IDG Temp was flashing green. We noticed it get to 146 degrees. This was also on the number 2 engine. Due to these problems happening so close together we [advised ATC] and got the plane on the ground with no incident. The ground equipment followed us to the gate and there were no other issues.Air Bleed issue and then an IDG problem. We did not want more issues to occur with that engine. We were close to ZZZ and already on the radio with approach; so we continued to ZZZ. I do not know what can stop an air bleed or IDG problem.

Flight diversion occurred to ZZZ due to an enroute failure of the APU Generator. The #1 engine generator was initially on placard bringing the flight down to one single AC power source. No non-normal situation exists in the Flight Manual; but is trained that a single AC sources requires diversion to the nearest suitable airport. The Dispatcher contacted the Operations Manager immediately after the flight crew reported the event. I was notified of the event by calling the Dispatch to inquire about the flight status when [Software Program] alerted that the flight destined to ZZZ1 was diverting to ZZZ1; which was incorrect; but usually indicates something abnormal may be happening.Per 737 Flight Manual 'Landing at Nearest Suitable Airport' section; there are specific situations where pilot should plan to land at the nearest suitable airport to include 'Electrical - Only one AC power source remains.' No calls were made to the Maintenance Director or Chief Dispatcher until the diversion was in progress. Per the Dispatcher's Manual under the Dispatch Emergency/Irregular Checklist the Dispatcher should notify the Maintenance Director if the diversion to the nearest suitable airport is required. This also is in direct contravention to the Dispatcher's Manual for notification of any inflight notification of mechanical issues as well as the Dispatchers Manual Notification during irregular operations.The Flight Crew did [request priority handling] on arrival which was only discovered after I requested the Dispatcher get briefed by the flight. Failure to notify the Maintenance Director could have resulted in the [Company process] not being issued or company indication via Company process that [priority was requested] for a Operator flight.I have spoken with the Dispatcher for the flight to discuss the events in a post-review. After arrival in ZZZ the Director asked if I would issue the [Company Process]. I replied in the affirmative and requested the Director to have the Operations Managers advise the Maintenance Director when a similar significant event occurs. I was answered with silence.

Electrical system failure in flight: I positioned a Aircraft X from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 for a Part 91 skydiving operation at the edge of the ZZZ2 Class D and under a ZZZ3 Class B shelf. Prior to the operations NOTAMs had been filed and I spoke with ZZZ TRACON about the plan; as well as advised ZZZ2 Tower of the operations that would be happening at the edge of their airspace. I departed with the jumpers; climbed to 2000 ft. MSL for a low pass to assess winds; and then climbed to 3500 ft. MSL. Shortly after departure I contacted ZZZ Approach on the radio; received a squawk; and had been identified on radar. During the climb to 3500 ft. MSL I lost my GPS/Comm 1 radio; then quickly lost my Comm 2 radio before I could switch over frequencies to that. The transponder also died before I could squawk XXXX. Each piece of equipment died quickly; one after the other. I continued to assess the situation while I circled overhead the drop zone as the jumpers prepared to jump. I called our company on the phone to help find a number for ZZZ2 Tower to let them know I was inbound NORDO. We were unable to find a Tower phone number so I called clearance delivery; the only ATC phone number for ZZZ2 in the iPad; to explain that I had a complete electrical failure and I asked for a relay to let ZZZ2 Tower know I was currently in a high right downwind for Runway XX. I had a moving map on my tablet using the iPad and was able to see other traffic on there; as well as visually acquire that traffic. I saw the traffic make a turn away from the area; which led me to assume that Tower had directed them out of the area to prioritize me. I did not look to see a light gun from the Tower at the time but did identify a fire truck near the runway intersection; which was another confirmation of my priority. The landing was uneventful and I taxied clear toward a FBO hangar and talked with the fire department personnel. Upon further inspection; I identified a broken belt on the alternator. The weather that day was going to be challenging with convective weather all around. The destination (ZZZ2) was experiencing strong thunderstorms about the time of my planned departure time; with only about an hour long flight. I decided to delay the departure about 30-45 minutes; but then I experience a thunderstorm at ZZZ1 when I wanted to depart. Ultimately; I was able to safely depart after the storm had passed and dissipated; and the positioning leg was uneventful; however; we were behind schedule. It was my first flight through the ZZZ3 Class Bravo so I flight planned quite extensively. This mitigation also helped with understanding the airspace in which we were operating and facilitated a safe landing at ZZZ2 after the electrical failure. There was a small amount of '-itis' to get the job done; especially with the weather delays; but I felt that weather hazards and external pressures were ultimately mitigated. In the event of another NORDO scenario; ensure that the Tower is providing the proper light gun signals before assuming it is safe to land.

Approaching cruise after initial climb out at FL200 we received a L HYD QTY Message. We referenced the QRH which did not have any corrective steps. The L Hydraulic Quantity was seen decreasing; with the magenta 'RF' visible. Shortly thereafter we got the L HYD SYS PRESS Message; the aircraft began a slow roll to the right. Pilot Flying turned off the left autopilot to stabilize the aircraft and then engaged the center autopilot; which operated as expected. We [requested priority handling]; got cleared direct ZZZZZ to hold as published for ZZZ ILS XX approach and began a descent to 5;000 feet. We completed QRH and began configuring to land and saw that the flaps/slats were not moving according to the indicator; though it felt like flaps were extending. We also had to perform the alternate gear extension; and decided to land at ZZZ1 since it had a 11;000 foot runway and we wanted to ensure a safe landing. With checklists complete we received vectors and landed uneventfully on Runway XY. We taxied onto Taxiway B to clear the runway and shutdown there. Loss of all left hydraulic fluid and pressure due to unknown issue.

During climbout at approximately FL240; the First Officer's windshield R1 suddenly cracked. It was determined to be the outer layer of the window. We immediately leveled off; and asked ATC for a return. We ran the appropriate Quick Reference Handbook Checklist and Diversion Checklist. Dispatch seemed to immediately know that something wasn't right and we responded to their message confirming an air return. We notified the Flight Attendants first; then the passengers telling them exactly what had happened and why we were returning to Denver.We did not request priority handling but ATC began to refer to us as a critical aircraft so we went with that assuming that they had declared priority handling for us. We made an uneventful smooth overweight landing. There were multiple emergency vehicles lined along the runway as we landed. Logbook entries were made for both the cracked windshield; and the overweight landing specifying the smooth landing and a brakes-on speed of 65 kts. Dispatch and Maintenance Control were called at the gate. Another aircraft had been designated for the continuation of the flight. The First Officer and I determined that we were okay to continue to operate the [next] flight.

Prior to takeoff from Runway 28R/N5; ORD Tower gave a clearance to turn RIGHT heading 040. Takeoff clearance was acknowledged and takeoff roll was initiated.  The aircraft departing ahead of us was a Boeing 757; which departed on the same exact path as we did. Our takeoff clearance was received as the 757 was ROTATING. Both pilots immediately recognized the wake turbulence hazard associated with a 757; especially when following so close. Right after takeoff at about 200 ft.; we encountered pretty strong wake which caused a rolling moment to the right. The PF (Pilot Flying) properly initiated a left turn to try to avoid the dangerous path. Upon stabilizing the airplane and returning to normal flight; we received a radio call from ATC stating that we were supposed to turn right; to which I replied: do you want us to go left or right? ATC responded with the word: ACTUALLY. Not being sure of what that meant; I asked them again; which way did they want us to turn. ATC then said 'turn right all the way 040 heading'. We then continued as planned and no further incident occurred.Two parts on this. Both pilots lost situational awareness as to what the initial clearance to turn was; due to being caught up in trying to avoid the wake turbulence. Also; the crew could have asked for a short delay on the runway; as soon as the threat was detected prior to takeoff. On the other hand; I'm not exactly sure what the minimum separation is when taking off behind a 757; but I feel like this take off clearance was rushed. Fatigue could also have (unknowingly) played a factor in this.

Climbing thru 13;000 [ft.] I noticed that the cabin was not pressurizing correctly it was over pressurized for our altitude. So I halted the climb; asked to remain at 13;000. Center said descent to 10;000 I did so; and did some trouble shooting; asked my FO (First Officer) to call for return to ZZZ1. We returned contacted Maintenance. Did not exit the aircraft. Went thru checklist and it turned out to be a sticky bleed valve switch and by cycling them it fixed our issue. I did NOT [request priority]. Tower said because I returned it warranted one. We took back off on a new FP (Flight Plan) then around 14;000 checked to make sure everything was normal and it was so we continued with our day.

Aircraft X checked in with me; working the final sector; direct a fix on the RNAV XXR approach that we do not normally send aircraft to. They were direct that fix to go behind an unidentified VFR target. Because of this I pulled up the approach plate on the ACE-IDS above me to make sure I was giving a correct clearance and could ensure the aircraft was flying the approach correctly. I cleared Aircraft X to cross ZZZZZ at 5000 ft. and cleared for the RNAV XXR approach. The Pilot read back correctly except he read back Runway XYR. I reissued the approach clearance to clarify the assigned runway; since there is no XY at ZZZ1. The pilot again read back Runway XYR and I verified that he was landing XXR at ZZZ1 and he corrected to the correct approach and runway. Aircraft Y checked in on the downwind and I gave a vector for Runway 30 and altitude of 5000 ft. expecting to turn base over top of Aircraft X when he reached ZZZZZ1 at 3400 ft. I descended Aircraft Y to 3400 ft. when I meant 4400 ft. and didn't catch the readback because it was what I had said and I was starting to notice Aircraft X doing something out of the normal. I noticed that Aircraft X was not tracking at ZZZZZ2; and looked up to confirm with the plate; then asked the Pilot to verify he was still on the approach. As he was responding to this query I saw he was continuing his descent below the MVA and next fix on the approach. I immediately issued a low altitude alert; canceled the approach clearance and climbed the aircraft to a safe altitude. I noticed that Aircraft Y was descending past 4400 ft. and so I turned south to go behind the climbing Aircraft X. I asked the Aircraft X if he had the field in sight for a visual approach to which he said no and then responded in the affirmative so I cleared him for the visual approach. I also cleared the Aircraft Y for the visual approach also.After speaking with the Pilot; the Supervisor reported the aircraft had been looking at his iPad and when I asked if he was tracking the approach; looked up and dropped the iPad; in retrieving it the airplane dived and the low altitude alert gave him the alert needed to climb the aircraft to a safe altitude. [Recommendation:] there were multiple contributing factors but none that could be changed due to the split second decisions that happen every day.

During descent on the ZZZZZ1 arrival into ZZZ; and just after passing 17000 ft. the aircraft began an uncommanded roll to the right. The autopilot was on and the warning system said 'roll authority ' and displayed the red warning 'roll authority ' on the Primary Flight Display. I announced 'upset' and clicked off the Auto Pilot and applied left aileron to counter the bank. I stabilized the aircraft and shortly thereafter got into more wake that required right bank to keep the aircraft steady.The Captain notified ATC about the wake turbulence; and we were given a heading of 210 to get us away from the direct path of what we learned was a heavy 777. ATC turned us right to 280 and before completing the turn cleared us direct ZZZZZ2. We did not encounter any additional wake turbulence and landed uneventfully on Runway XYR.

Flying back from ZZZ; usual route is tank farm to ZZZ1 per school policy. Light rain began and crackling on the headsets near tank farm. We descended circling over the tank farm from 3;500 MSL to 2;000 MSL and reduced our speed to see if it improved. No change. We attempted to contact ZZZ1 with our position and got only crackling. Weather info was recorded via foreflight. We squawked 7600 and ident; then proceeded inbound for a left base Runway XX the usual instruction in this weather condition. Watched ADS-B and saw no traffic; proceeded with caution. Requested light signals and rocked our wings. Ident again. First pass was a go-around because no light signals were received. Radioed Tower on climb requesting light signals; mentioning we had no radio reception. Made left traffic. No traffic in sight or on ADS-B. Light signals received on second attempt at final Runway XX. Solid green. Landed; turn off Taxiway 1. Flashing green. After-landing configuration; then proceeded the usual taxi route Taxiway 2; 3; 4 to FBO Ramp.

We were inflight and out of sterile when the Captain called me while I was about half way through the beverage service. He said that there was an issue with the nose gear door opened and we had to return to ZZZ asap. He did not declare an emergency and told me that we would be doing normal landing procedures. We both made an announcement and I discontinued service and prepared the cabin for landing. Once at the Gate we deplaned the passengers and the plane went to the hangar for maintenance.

IFR departure from ZZZ; Mooney M20C; weather: wind 190@8 knots; VIS 10; skies clear; Pilot Flying in left front seat and passenger in front right seat. Provided a passenger safety briefing using the SAFETY acronym. Run up checks completed; no issues noted. Pre-takeoff safety briefing completed including runway to be used; type of takeoff; V speeds; actions and runways to be used in case of engine failure or mechanical concerns. Takeoff safety briefing and surface winds both indicated a favorable emergency return to Runway XX; as this would require less than 180 degrees of turn to line up. ATC cleared for takeoff Runway XYR; verified correct runway; applied takeoff power; verified engine RPM and manifold pressure correct; verified all engine gauges in the green; verified airspeed alive. Rotate at Vr 70 mph; then pitch for Vy 100 MPH; approximately 50 feet AGL detected uncommanded engine RPM increase exceeding 2;700 RPM. Pulled the propeller control to reduce RPM; detected this had no effect. Reduced manifold pressure in order to reduce engine RPM below red line. Informed ATC of a mechanical issue and need to return to the airport; now passing through approximately 300 feet AGL. Instructed by ZZZ Tower to make right traffic Runway XYR and read back the instructions. Moments later noticed engine oil pressure reduction to near zero pressure. Combination of low oil pressure and lack of propeller control suggests an engine oil leak in the governor system. Decided it was prudent for safety of flight not to fly standard traffic pattern as instructed by ATC out of concern of low oil pressure possibly resulting in engine failure during the several minutes required to fly the pattern. Passing approximately over the departure end of Runway XYR at approximately 400 ft. AGL [received priority] in order to deviate from ATC instructions and minimize the time in flight due to concerns of engine failure; informed ATC of intentions to land on Runway XX. ATC promptly provided landing clearance for any runway. Maneuvered to line up with Runway XX while maintaining appropriate safe airspeed using partial engine power. Quick check for landing gear down and added landing flaps. Landed normally approximately midfield Runway XX; comfortably taxied off on [Taxiway] 1. Informed ATC of intentions to taxi back to parking; but observed zero oil pressure during after-landing checklist and detected odor of burning oil. Stopped the aircraft in the non-movement area directly ahead of [Taxiway] 1 shut down the aircraft and evacuated. After evacuation observed the engine cowling; bottom of fuselage and some of the wing surfaces coated in engine oil. No fire occurred; no injury to persons on board or on the ground; no damage to airport structures. Successful outcome can be partially attributed to detailed pre-takeoff safety briefing including actions in case of engine failure and intended emergency runway to be used. Additionally; continuous and careful monitoring of instruments and engine gauges during critical phase of flight allowed for rapid detection of engine irregularities.
