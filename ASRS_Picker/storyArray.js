I was performing a flight instruction with my student; it was his second flight as a student pilot. After performing brake test I gave my student the flight controls so he could proceed and taxi as required per lesson 2. We got cleared to taxi to the runway by Ground. As we were approaching the run up area my student applied excessive left rudder. [I called] 'I've got the flight controls' to correct and align the aircraft back to runway center  line. I applied right rudder and brakes but the brakes from the right seat of the aircraft didn't respond. We stopped at the edge of the taxiway and run up area for the runway with no damage to the aircraft or airport environment.

While in flight at level cruise at FL320; I was in the bunk in the rear of the aircraft when I noticed a power reduction. Immediately afterwards; the seat belt sign illuminated and I made my way to the flight deck. There was a FLAPS DRIVE EICAS with an expanded flap display indicating that the right mid-span leading edge flap deployed. As a result the airspeed band became very tight between Mmo and the yellow band as the FMC wanted to honor the maximum flap extension speed. This was in close proximity to our stall speed. The auto throttle was disconnected and the Pilot Flying manually maintained Mach. 75. We consulted with the company via sat-phone and were advised to return to ZZZ. We coordinated with ATC for the return and fuel dump. An uneventful landing was made below MLW.

DATE Flight from ZZZ1-ZZZZ. After departing ZZZ1 during our climb to altitude we received numerous A/I WING HOT R Crew Alert System messages. We ran the check list for above Crew Alert System message performing action described. After Crew Alert System message reoccurred with all anti ice off and reducing power on the right engine the crew decided to [request priority handling.] After discussing the situation with operations the decision was made to change our destination to ZZZ2 because that was the closest suitable airport with VFR conditions not requiring a descent through icing condition. Eventually the Crew Alert System message went out and stayed out. The flight proceed without further incident.

I was working the ZZZ Sector with some afternoon arrival traffic. I received a handoff from ZZZ1 with Aircraft X. I told them to expect the RNAV Runway XXL and descended them to 050. I then went back and cleared Aircraft X to cross ZZZZZ at or above 047; cleared ZZZ2 approach. The pilot read it back correctly. I subsequently slowed the aircraft after the clearance and read back. During my scan; I saw Aircraft X at 042 outside of ZZZZZ in a 044 MVA. I issued a low altitude alert and asked if they had the field in sight. They did so I cleared them for a visual approach to eliminate the MVA requirements; Aircraft X proceeded on the visual; ended up calling traffic ahead in sight; and followed them in landing without incident. This is a tough event to prevent a reoccurrence of from the Controller side because I verified that the read back was in fact correct; even listening to the audio after the fact. Somehow in the cockpit the restriction got lost as far as I can tell. Luckily in this instance; I observed the aircraft descending below my issued restriction quickly and ensured that VMC allowed them to be on a visual approach. The low altitude alert was definitely necessary to prevent a further descent. I will continue to scan at all times to continue to try to catch these errors in the future; and issue alerts as necessary to correct instances like this.

I was working lunch relief shift. At XA:19 I was covering H alley ramp control for 15min break from XA:20 till XA:37. Relieved ramp controller advised inbound aircraft holding on the pad for X5. No movement in the alley. Gate X8 schedule departure XA:25 request push at XA:21. HX push was approved at XA:21 aircraft pushed at XA:21:18. X8 push to east taxi line complete XA:23:18. X14 schedule departure XA:30 request push XA:25 and approved for push. X14 pushed XA:25:33 to the east taxi line. X14 push complete at XA:27:00. X14 request taxi XA:28 approved out East taxi line aircraft taxied at XA:28:29. X8 request taxi XA:29 approved taxi out east line at XA:29 aircraft moved XA:29:15 number two in sequence on the east taxi line of the H alley. X4 schedule departure XA:30 request push XA:29 and approved. X4 pushed XA:29:38 on to the east taxi line; tail south. X10 schedule departure XA:35 request push XA:29 held for taxi traffic off X8. X8 cleared east taxi line behind X10 at XA:30:25. Y5 request push and approved XA:30.Y5 pushed at XA:31:01 to the west taxi line complete at XA:31:53. X10 push approved XA:31:07. I stopped X10 push at XA:31:45 when I realized lack of clearance for the push with aircraft off X4 in push back. X10 stopped on the push line just at the start of the turn off X10. X4 push was not stopped and was complete on the white box a beam gate X6 at XA:32:07. Y11 request push XA:33 and approved. Y11 push to west line complete XA:33:40. Y11 taxied at XA:36:35 number one on the west line. Y5 taxi at XA:36:09 number two in sequence on the west line. Aircraft X4 taxi approved XA:36:39 in sequence number three on the west line. [Relieved ramp controller] returned from break at XA:37 I advised X10 push was held and to resume push once aircraft off X4 taxi to west line. X10 resumed push at XA:37:02.As I monitored the push off X4 to the east line tail south and saw pushing past red box; I immediately stopped the push on X10. Aircraft was still on the X10 taxi line and had just started the turn. I apologized for the stop and advised will resume shortly; explaining I had observed there will not be enough room with the push off X4. I turned to my co-worker; the turn coordinator for zone 3 (gates X18; X16; X14; X12; X10; X8; X6; X5; X4); I advised I stopped the X10 push in case ramp control called asking questions. I advised of the alley traffic and plan to continue the push after aircraft X4 taxi to the west line.X bottom of the east line of the alley has two push boxes one red between X4 & X5 gates; one white box for main line between X5 & X6. My shift assigned lunch relief to cover all breaks for ramp control and turn coordinators on shift. I work from my position relieving each employee for their assigned breaks. I had just relieved H ramp control for [their] 15 minute break at XA:19.  Relieved ramp controller advised inbound aircraft holding on the pad for Y5. No movement in the alley. I was on leave of absence for X days for covid-19 illness. No idea why I mixed up the red box for the push point for main line from X4 & X5 pushes; but I did. When I approved the push for X10; my vision was X4 was pushing with nose on red box lower in the alley than the white box on the east line.I managed the X alley ramp traffic and took safe actions to correct my error. No aircraft made contact; no ramp fleet service employees were outside the X10 taxi area. As the events unfolded my manager asked why I thought there was clearance to push X4 & X10 mainline aircraft. I advised I confused the white and red push boxes on the east line. Apologized for my confusion and advised I stopped the X10 aircraft from completing the push to the east line; and will continue the push after I clear the alley traffic. Not to confuse the push boxes on the east line of the X alley. Working as lunch relief there is no time to pre-plan departure pushes. I have to react; pick up where my college was working to relieve them on breaks.

Cleared RNAV M into Runway 29. Received low altitude report from ATC for below 5K over ANN based on 2000 ft. at or above at CEPKU. Missed programming 5K at or above ANN. Loading the arrival with the ANN transition does not provide an altitude at ANN. VMC at the time Center provided low altitude alert. Did not cancel IFR until landing; but remained VMC for remainder of approach. Captain (CA) was Pilot Flying (PF). First Officer (FO) was Pilot Monitoring (PM). No operational impact. Remember to program 5K at or above at ANN; when not given an altitude restriction by ATC on the arrival for RNAV M to 29. Loading the arrival with the ANN transition does not provide an altitude at ANN. Recommend 10-7 addition to crews.

During the descent into DEN on the NIIXX 3 RNAV arrival we received ECAM messages for the loss of ADSB-1 and 2 RPTNG passing through approximately 13;500 feet in the vicinity of BSTON waypoint.  While continuing our descent we lost GPS-1 signal at about 11;500 feet and then GPS-2 signal at about 7;500 feet.  We assume that this was due to 5G interference.  We reported these items to DEN Approach and submitted the appropriate error maintenance codes.

Planned departure of XB:40 from ZZZZ. We arrived at the aircraft at XA:40 to a dark flight deck with only the ground service bus powered. This was the fourth flight of a three-day trip for the Captain-in-training during his first OE sequence. This was also the Captain-in-training qualification flight to/from ZZZZ. The Captain-in-training was the Pilot Flying (PF). ZZZZ had a 1000 ft. ceiling that was clear above 2000 ft. AGL. After a normal takeoff; the right seat Pilot Monitoring (PM) instructor noticed the gear was not retracting and informed the PF the gear were not coming up. Since we were climbing at the 0/Ret Minimum Maneuver speed until we were clear of terrain; we were climbing at 215 kts. We asked to level at 9;000 ft. and hold over the airfield at the ZZZZ1 VOR. It was suspected the nose gear pin had been left in and was possibly missed during the salute. I had considered running the 'Landing Gear Lever Will Not Move Up After Takeoff' QRH. However; the conditions were not met because the gear handle did move up. An attempt was unsuccessfully made to retract the gear by recycling the gear handle. The aircraft was below maximum landing weight and we had a safe landing configuration; so the decision was made to return to ZZZZ to have the suspected bypass pin removed if that was the problem. Upon returning to the gate; it was discovered the pin was not left in the nose gear and Maintenance found no faults in the gear operating system. Upon returning to the flight deck; the Instructor Pilot discovered the manual gear extension access door was ajar. The light on the aft pedestal was not illuminated during preflight and we were not aware of when that door was breached. Upon resetting the access door on the flight deck floor; the light on the aft pedestal extinguished and it was clear we had resolved the problem. An INFO-ITEM was entered into the Approved Model List and the aircraft departed and flew to ZZZ uneventfully with a 60 minute delay.OE training; hit city special qualification airfield training; terrain; weather; ATC foreign communication.Ensure the manual extension access door is firmly closed during every preflight and before takeoff.

Near departure time; The flight crew called in that the Fwd E&E Door indicated open. I found the Fwd E&E Door upon my inspection. I cycled the forward plunger switch several times and then closed the door. The flight deck indication remained on. I placard the door warning light indication per MEL XX-XXA. After takeoff the aircraft would not pressurize and air interrupted back to ZZZ. The event occurred because both E&E Doors were left open for unknown reasons. The crew complaint was about the Fwd E&E Door. This became my main focus. To avoid this situation in the future i would do further troubleshooting and inspection and ignore the pressure of an on-time departure. For whatever reason the doors were open they should be closed.

While on initial approach into ZZZ; I was cleared for the RNAV-XX via the ZZZZZ IAF. I was given the restriction to cross ZZZZZ at 4000 ft. I compiled with this restriction; then began my descent after crossing ZZZZZ for the next altitude. I selected 3;300 ft. on my altitude pre-select for the leg from ZZZZZ to ZZZZZ1. However; I didn't realize until crossing ZZZZZ1 that I selected the wrong altitude. On the Jeppesen charts; the altitude for the leg from ZZZZZ to ZZZZZ1 is in an inset; and the altitude for the leg is not prominent. While writing this report; I compared the NACO chart for the approach; and noticed that the altitude for this leg is presented in the same way as other legs. Just after noticing this error; Approach issued a 'check altitude' alert; but at that point; I had already crossed the ZZZZZ1 fix; and was at the appropriate altitude. Due to the fact that I was already at the appropriate altitude for this leg; there was no required corrective action. My initial training and check-ride was done using NACO charts; and I've only switched to Jepp charts in the last 2 years. In the future; I'll have to brief charts more carefully; and perhaps cross-reference against the NACO chart before beginning the approach; when workload is high.Contributing factors are high workload phase of flight; IMC conditions with continuous moderate turbulence; recent change in instrument charting provider and fatigue after 3 hour flight out of complex airspace

Departed ZZZ; Aircraft X; to ZZZ1 on Date. Approximately 100 E/NE ZZZ2 while at FL340 at XA50Z; while deviating north for weather; the flight crew received a Master Caution and ECAM for HYD SYS LO PRSR for the Yellow Hydraulic System. Subsequently; a FLT CNTRL ECAM was received due a partial spoiler deployment (#4) on the right wing. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying and the Captain was the Pilot Monitoring. All QRC; ECAM; QRH and follow-up procedures were completed by the Pilot Monitoring. While the Pilot Flying continued the weather deviation; the Pilot Monitoring conferred with dispatch on flight options and diversion details; to include the NOTAMs for ZZZ2. A request for priority handling was made and a diversion to ZZZ2 with ATC priority radar vectors for descent. Coordination via a precautionary landing brief to the flight attendants and passenger PA were also completed. Additional information regarding the partial spoiler deployment was obtained via communication between the Pilot Monitoring and the number one Flight Attendant via a visual inspection of the right wing. There was a noticeable right wing dip at altitude and increased buffet and droop during the descent and approach phase of flight. The Pilot Flying executed a visual approach; with the electronic means of backup using the ILS XXR to an underweight landing (132;000 pounds). After clearing the Runway; an Airport Rescue and Firefighting vision inspection was executed; with the crew confirming flight crew suspicions of hydraulic fluid loss along the belly of the aircraft. With the Green; Blue hydraulic systems intact; the aircraft was taxied to Gate XX. Cause was determined to be the mechanical failure of Yellow System Reservoir. ECAM status page mentions approach phase procedures which result in return of HYD SYS LO PRSR ECAM warning (engine pump on) which can confuse with electric pump on since both work with Yellow System.

Westbound on NAT C at FL350 in Shanwick Oceanic our offset was zero. When we encountered minor wake from the preceding aircraft 1000 ft above. The Captain who was pilot flying announced to me that he was going to offset L1 to get out of the turbulence. We applied L1; verified and executed in the route page. At the time of execution I was thinking that something is not quite correct but didn't think too much of it after. Eventually we changed crew for break; the Captain was going for his break and the Relief Pilot was coming back; and a changeover briefing was accomplished including we were offset L1. A [few minutes later] Gander queried us via voice saying that they show us offset L1. We responded affirmative and there was no further communication. It was at this time that the Relief Pilot (who was now the PF) realized and pointed out that he didn't think we were allowed to offset Left. They confirmed by looking in the QRG/ FOM that Left offsets were not authorized and switched immediately to R1.

On the short final of Runway XX at ZZZ; I got very close to an aircraft that is conducting a missed approach to Runway XX because I misjudged their speed. There was also a confirmation bias on my side that created the situation. Below is the detailed explanation of the situation and corrective actions I should have taken. On downwind; I noticed the aircraft performing a RNAVXX approach into ZZZ by looking at the Foreflight traffic information. Then; right before I was abeam of the departure end of Runway XX; I heard the aircraft making a position call over the CTAF saying 'Aircraft Y; 5 miles final RNAVXX; low approach only.' With this information; I assumed that the aircraft is a single-engine aircraft and I presumed that they are shooting the LNAV approach; which was totally wrong. Then I checked their groundspeed via Foreflight and saw them flying around 105 kts.After getting the information; I was wondering whether I should extend downwind or start the base turn; then with my wrong assumption of his approach minimum; I decided to turn to the left base of Runway XX in front of the traffic because I thought there will be enough space between us. About 1.5 NM/1 minute horizontal separation when they execute missed approach. On the base leg; I had the aircraft in-sight; and the separation between us looked acceptable at the moment; so I decided to continue my landing. I could have gone around on the base leg and departed to the east at this point that would have eliminated the near-miss situation. During my final turn; the traffic also made a position call saying 'Aircraft Y; on 2 miles final Runway XX.' Therefore; I made a position call stating 'I am on short final Runway XX' in order to let them know I turned in front of them. I should have included the specific concern and said 'I am on short final Runway XX in front of Aircraft Y' so that the Pilot in the other aircraft is also alerted.On the short final; I was flying around 60 kts. ground speed; and I was expecting them to decelerate to 85 kts. ground speed and level off at LNAV minimum because I was presumed that they are doing LNAV approach. Then I saw the aircraft continuing to descend to the runway at a relatively faster speed. At this point; I finally recognized that my assumption was wrong and they are doing LPV approach to missed approach. I decided to continue my landing because I didn't want to penetrate their missed approach course and get closer while climbing each other. The aircraft executed a go-around right before the threshold; I am guessing at the LPV minimum; and departed to the north after that. There were many chances to confirm that the aircraft is performing missed approach at a higher minimum by asking on CTAF; executing go around earlier and depart the pattern; or changing my course of action to follow the traffic; however; I chose the worst option available for each decision making process and got close to the aircraft by misjudging their ground speed and presume their intention.

Received 'L ENG BLEED' amber caution message on climb out; followed by 'L COWL A/I' amber caution message. I was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for the and directed the First Officer (FO) to continue the climb and maintain aircraft control; while I ran the Quick Reference Card (QRC) and Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and covered the radio. I ran the L ENG BLEED QRH procedure. The procedure directed us to; 'Leave icing conditions to prevent ice accumulation on inoperative cowl'. As we were then operating in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC); I directed the FO to continue the climb visual meteorological conditions (VMC) which were forecasted at our planned final cruising altitude. We reached VMC conditions and I communicated our situation to ATC and Company Dispatch (including company maintenance through ACARS). I conveyed to each that we would need to descend in VMC conditions to our destination if able. ATC advised us to inform the next Controller and handed us off to the next sector. There was confusion apparent with both ATC and the Company regarding our situation. I attempted to state as clearly as possible that we would require VMC descent from our cruise altitude. We were then given a descent clearance through IMC ahead. I declined the clearance and again made our situation known - that we were unable to enter icing conditions. ATC queried several aircraft on the arrival ahead of us. All reported IMC but negative icing. ATC relayed this to us and; I believe; again issued a descent clearance. When I declined again; ATC informed us that no aircraft had reported icing in the descent. I stated that we would be unable to accept a clearance into any IMC conditions as that would put us into conditions conducive to ice formation as defined by our Pilot Operating Handbook; and that the negative reports of the aircraft ahead were inconsequential to our current condition. I asked for a hold at altitude so that we could consult with the Company and asked that ATC offer assistance by checking other potential ZZZ2 arrivals or a radar vectored descent to ZZZ2 or any nearby airport with VMC conditions from our altitude to the surface. ATC said that they; '...cannot see clouds;' but that they would check. We were assigned; and entered; a hold at ZZZZZ1; where I conferred with our Company Dispatcher who checked weather at ZZZ3 and ZZZ as requested; however apparently also misunderstood the situation and suggested that we were okay to descend through IMC; after having consulted with a Supervisor. The FO and I separately calculated bingo fuel and were within 100 pounds of each other. I informed the dispatcher of remaining fuel on board (FOB) and our time remaining until bingo holding fuel. As we neared our bingo fuel the FO and I made the decision to divert to ZZZ as weather conditions were most clear there and our descent would put us through the least amount of IMC within our range. We requested vectors to ZZZ and [requested priority handling] due to the required entry and descent through IMC/icing conditions. I also informed ATC of minimum fuel status at this time. We were vectored and subsequently assigned the ZZZZZ 3 arrival into ZZZ. I informed Company Dispatch that we were diverting to ZZZ; had [requested priority handling]; and stated our FOB. We descended through IMC into VMC conditions as I finalized programming the FMS and approach. ATC requested a statement of flight conditions. I relayed that we were now VMC. ATC asked if I was cancelling the [priority handling]. During these transmissions I showed the FO our updated fuel numbers with the arrival and long-side approach to ZZZ now built into the FMS. Our new fuel-over-destination (FOD) calculation was 1830lbs; which was below our required planned reserve of 2224lbs. I elected to maintain [priority] aircraft status and relayed this to ATC with an explanation of the new [situation] being [priority] fuel.' We continued the arrival. On arrival; it seemed that several aircraft were being vectored to land ahead of us; and we were tracking away from the airport; albeit on the ZZZZZ 3 arrival. I asked ATC for a turn direct to the airport; was questioned; and I again stated that we were [priority] fuel and do not want to be flying away from the airport. We were then given a vector towards the field and assigned landing Runway XXR. Once I cleaned up the approach in the FMS our fuel numbers were again above required reserve amount. FO landed the aircraft at 2130 FOB."

At approximately 1000 ft. just outside 3 miles in VMC to Runway 8 at JAX; the First Officer's radio altimeter intermittently would go out (was replaced by an amber RA) and then come back. The Captain's radio altimeter worked the entire time. We also had our Autoland Status indicator go blank. It had previously shown a green Land 3 indication. JAX does have a 5G NOTAM for Runway 08; but we also have a Alternate Means of Compliance approved for all runways at JAX. 5G?

After getting a canceled approach clearance due to birds on the runway we executed a non-standard go around procedure and entered the traffic pattern as directed by ATC. Once re-cleared for the approach we turned base and started a descent. During this time a momentary 'OBSTACLE' aural was heard and corrected immediately by overriding automation. The rest of the approach and landing continued normally and we debriefed the event. Non standard go around and approach procedure on unfamiliar area. High workload environment. Stay higher on visual approaches to unfamiliar airports.

Taxiing out of ZZZ we got a number 2 HP Bleed Fault and after ECAM and QRH procedures contacted Dispatch and Company and returned to the blocks. Number 2 HP bleed valve was deferred and we departed again. Flight was uneventful. Landing was normal and Captain used idle thrust with normal indications. After clearing Runway and communicating with Ground and Ramp the auto throttle paddle clicked off; ECAM alerted and ATS would not reset. I also noticed number 2 TR showed unlocked and pointed this out to The Captain; who verified TR lever was fully down. Taxied into parking and shut down; and viewed damage on cowling.

While on the decent into ZZZ; approximately 13;000 feet; the right engine failed. It was a standard arrival with the FO (first officer) as PF (pilot flying). I was jump seat observer during the flight. As we were already in an idle decent there was no major power loss feel; just a slight bump noise. This was followed by the A/T Disconnect warning sound which brought our attention to the EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System). We began noticing all the messages associated with a generator loss and the oil pressure red boxed. We all collectively confirmed a right engine failure. The CA directed the FO to continue as PF; started the APU; notified ATC and requested a heading and level off altitude of 10;000 feet. As observer I also pulled up the Engine Failure/Engine Shutdown checklist and assisted in the confirmation and analysis. We confirmed that we still had N1 and N3 rotation; oil quantity; no high vibrations; and nothing that would indicate severe damage. Per the checklist; the right engine was shut down and then driven to a restart. With the windmilling rotation; we had the option for a X-Bleed start which was performed and was successful. As we performed the checklist; ATC gave us a turn to the left which we accepted. They asked if assistance was needed or if we would be [requesting priority handling]. With the successful restart of the right engine and the checklist complete; there was no obvious need for either. The CA (Captain) then fully briefed in the event of another failure on landing; what the expectation would be and the thresholds for going around or continuing to land. MX (Maintenance) was notified via ACARS message. We then continued and landed uneventfully. Highest threat level was the fact that both me and the FO (PF) were new to the fleet. The startle factor and the lack of an obvious power loss being at idle decent also played a part in the processing and time to begin the checklist. Overall; it is a well-trained procedure. The Captain's leadership in division of duties; excellent communication; situational awareness; workload management and methodical pacing; was instrumental in properly following all procedures. Being new to the fleet; it challenged me to remain current and proficient on all emergency procedures; stay vigilant in my studies and knowledge of the fleet; as well as strive for the excellent leadership the CA displayed.

I was working R24 for about an hour and a half today. All sectors around my sector were busy dealing with weather deviations and traffic routed from East coast to West coast. I did not have a D-side. During the session I had an aircraft respond to an RA descending above another aircraft. I think I violated W174. I estimate I probably had 3-4 airspace violations with Approach and surrounding sectors. This is/these are the incidents I noticed and/or remember. I did not have time to note aircraft call signs. A D-side would have helped with much of the coordination/airspace violations; but there simply was not sufficient staffing for a D-side. [I suggest] better staffing [and] better flow control.

Cleared to line up and wait after two minutes cleared for take-off. On beginning of take-off roll; aircraft veered far left on power up while advancing thrust levers; aircraft had no directional control even with large rudder input. Both engines spooled up normally but center line could not be maintained so take-off was discontinued at a very slow speed roughly taxi speeds. Nose wheel steering tiller still worked and we vacated the runway normally per ATC instructions.

While operating under IFR flight rules and mixed VMC/IMC conditions during an instrument training flight and receiving radar vectors for the ILS the electrical system failed completely. The flight was continued in VMC conditions and landed without further incident at the airport of origin. On the downwind of the ILS the aircraft and crew encountered an area of moderate turbulence in IMC conditions while the student (PF) was flying the aircraft and the instructor (PM) was monitoring. The student was struggling to maintain altitude and heading (+/- 20 degrees; 150 feet) so the instructor (PM) told the student (PF) to fly the attitude indicator and keep the wings level. Once clear of the turbulence the student returned to the assigned heading and altitude. The controller then stated that the aircraft had been flying off course by approximately 20 degrees to the right and the instructor advised the controller of the encountered turbulence as the reason for the deviation. The controller issued a turn inbound to intercept the ILS However; because the student (PF) was not yet prepared for the approach; delay vectors were requested and a turn to 360 was issued. The controls were transferred to allow the student to focus on preparing for the approach without the added workload of flying once the aircraft was on the assigned delay vector heading.While receiving delay vectors for the ILS the student (PM) was preparing for the instrument approach. ATC asked that we once again check our heading as they were showing the aircraft flying approximately 15-20 degrees right of the assigned heading. It was verified that we were on the appropriate heading on the HSI of 360 and checked the magnetic compass which indicated 020. The instructor (PF) noticed a message had come up on the Garmin G5 that we were using as the primary instrument source which read 'Not receiving ARINC data'. The instructor (PF) grabbed the STC for the G5 and handed it to the student (PM) asking that they find information on this message and to run the appropriate checklist.The instructor (PF) attempted to report the equipment issue to ATC on the communication 1 radio and the Garmin 430 GPS/COMM1/NAV1 subsequently failed. Realizing this may be an electrical system failure and in present VMC conditions the instructor decided to stay in those conditions and vacate the assigned heading and altitude while the failures were being addressed. The instructor (PF) began a descending turn to return to the airport and to stay below the layer of clouds. The instructor (PF) attempted to contact ATC on the communication 2 radio and was not able to contact them however was still able to hear the instructions and altitude alerts for deviating altitude and heading assignments. The instructor (PF) squawked 7600 and continued to contact ATC once more to no avail. The communication 2 radio and the transponder failed soon after. This occurred within a time frame of approximately 2 minutes.To begin troubleshooting the instructor (PF) looked at the ammeter and it was showing an indication of 0; the high voltage light was not illuminated; and there were no circuit breaker faults. Because this was an un-annunciated electrical failure the student (PM) was instructed to turn off the master switches; as all of the electrical components had failed; in accordance with the checklist.The flight was continued under VFR in VMC conditions. The student (PM) was able to use their handheld radio to make contact with the ATC tower and advised of what had happened. The tower issued a landing clearance and the aircraft landed safely without further incident by the instructor (PF).Maintenance personnel were able to determine that the battery had suffered a catastrophic failure.

My student and I were going for a dual training flight at XA:30 local time at ZZZ. We did the run up on the [FBO] ramp and the ground check was within the manufacturer's limit. When taking off; we had a small drop of RPM and power went back to normal; we aborted the takeoff and did another ground check. Everything was within the manufacturer's limit. Then; we departed and on the climb; we noticed a weak climb performance. Therefore we decided to make a precautionary landing back at ZZZ. After landing; we did another ground check on the [FBO] ramp and everything was within limits. We parked the plane and squawked the plane for maintenance inspection. Waiting for maintenance action.

Aircraft X flew into ZZZ with a COMM 1 and 2 issue. During much troubleshooting; the crew and mechanics reported seeing an 'ADC' (Air Data Computer) Amber msg on both PFDs. The COMM issue was resolved; then we began troubleshooting the ADC msg. During troubleshooting; I had the Mechanics power off the aircraft for around 30 minutes. When the Mechanics returned to the aircraft; I then had them disconnect both ADC Cannon Plugs and wait another 5 mins before powering on. I did not consider this to be an 'Installation' of the ADCs as is marked in the Required Inspection Item (RII) List. The Mechanics reconnected the Cannon Plugs and continued troubleshooting; as the Aircraft Power Down was not a fix. Later still during troubleshooting; the ADC Ops check was performed by a non-RII Mechanic; which at the time i did not realize was an RII Task.I will familiarize myself more with the RII List and be sure to always check and double check the List when sending roadtrips or asking Mechanics to perform tasks. I missed the 'System Check' Field of the ADC RII Listing before asking mechanics to perform the ADC Ops Check.

For me this event occurred one my 3rd leg of the day on day 5 of 6.  For this flight; we were originally supposed to have Aircraft Y.  When we got to the aircraft Maintenance was onboard investigating an open write up that previous crews had reported; fumes of unknown origin.  Maintenance couldn't find the issue and we were assigned a new plane. We arrived to Aircraft X and soon departed.  On climb out just after rotation; the captain and I noticed a smell but we both thought it was from the [prior aircraft] that took off prior to us. The smell went away quickly.Just before beginning the descent I had started to develop a slight headache. Upon starting descent a few moments later; we both started to smell the smell again.   At this time the Captain said he had a headache and I responded that I had one as well.  He then said he wanted to try something and gave me the radios (I was Pilot Flying and he was Pilot Monitoring) and donned the O2 mask for a couple of breaths. Then put his headset on and asked me to do the same.  I took a couple of breaths from the mask and instantly felt better. I realized at that time we were definitely experiencing fumes of some unknown origin in the flight deck and that it wasn't us just being paranoid because of the fact that our original plane we were supposed to fly had this exact issue written up.  I took my mask off and could really smell the fumes.  I told the Captain I instantly felt better on the O2 and I can really smell the fumes now.The Captain immediately called for Smoke/Fire/Fumes QRC.  At this time we were already descending on the STAR into our destination (maybe 15 min out).  Captain took over the aircraft and radios while I ran the QRC then QRH.  We started the QRH and requested special handling with ATC.  The Captain called the FAs (Flight Attendants) and informed them of the situation and they could not smell any fumes in the cabin.  We asked ATC to notify our Dispatch for us.  We continued on with the QRH and stopped the QRH when we got to 'RAT Manual Deploy Lever ........ PULL'.  We agreed to stop the QRH as we were less then 10min out from landing and did not want to put ourselves in an electrical emergency situation. Shortly after; we entered icing conditions and 'ICE CONDITION' along with 'STALL PROT ICE SPEEDS' appeared on EICAS. After loading ice speeds in we got a master caution for 'A-I WING FAIL'. After identify/cancel; Captain called for A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We then realized the bleeds were out from the SMOKE/FIRE/FUMES QRH and stopped the A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We broke out of the clouds about 5 seconds later and landed safely within a couple of minutes.  We were met on the ground by Crash Fire Rescue and notified them that we did not need any assistance and were good to continue to the gate.

We completed the NIXX3 arrival with no issue and ended up on a left downwind for Runway 17R. I was planning the ILS 17R for backup guidance for a visual approach. ATC had us assigned at 210 knots; vectored us heading 330 for a short base; left us at a high altitude; and cleared us for the visual into 17R effectively 'slam dunking' us to the runway. We began self factoring ourselves to intercept final at the FAF. We were left at 210 knots and high so we lowered the gear and began using spoilers to slow down in order to configure flaps. I switched to green needles to intercept the localizer and armed approach mode. Because we were so close there was a delay for the course to come alive which in turn caused a delay in our intercept and for us to begin overshooting final. The Captain took controls and the autopilot was disengaged to correct for this and we received a bank warning during the correction as we touched 45 degrees. There was no traffic interference and the slight overshoot was promptly corrected back to centerline on final. Immediately after once back on centerline during the configuration process ATC issued a low altitude warning at a radar altimeter of 960 feet. We verified we were slightly low; the captain added power and we climbed to 1;300 feet. The Captain verified the transfer of controls back to me; and I leveled out to re-intercept a proper glide path while continuing to configure. All proper call outs were made; no aircraft limitations were exceeded; and by 1;000 ft we were stabilized and cleared to land. The remainder of the approach; landing; and taxi was uneventful.The three main causes were ATC could have set us up for a better approach; task saturation; and autopilot reliance/I should have just hand flown the approach from the beginning instead of trying to have the autopilot intercept final.The main thing that can be done to avoid this is when using autopilot use white needles to intercept final when we're so close to the runway; or just hand fly the approach and use outside visual ques.

While on a 1-mile final to Runway 8 at BIV a drone was noticed hovering 50 feet from the aircraft right side (south of our course) between 400-500 feet AGL. The drone appeared to veer briefly after we passed. The drone was quad bladed 1-2ft in diameter; Black with Gold accents. Reported to the ATC facility once on the ground. Airport staff was unable to locate anyone on the ground in the immediate area and other aircraft did not see the drone as they approached the runway two minutes after our arrival. No action was needed for collision avoidance due to the lack of motion.

On approach to BUR; we were cleared for the ILS to Runway 8. We were in the middle of configuring for landing when about the time we were passing VNY airport; ATC (Approach) gave us a traffic advisory for an aircraft on our right that would be passing below and behind us. I looked down to see a converging symbol about 500 feet below us and instinctively turned off the autopilot anticipating a TCAS. Immediately following we received a 'monitor vertical speed' then a 'Climb' call and symbology. I hand flew the maneuver as required and noticed that the plane symbol appeared right below us at 400 feet. I want to say we were at flaps 15 and decelerating below 170 kts at the time though it all happened very quickly. We notified Approach we were responding to a TCAS RA. Soon after we received a 'clear of conflict' message. Approach asked if we wanted to continue; and we said Yes". I finished configuring and we were able to get back on the glideslope and hit the 1;000 foot mark fully stabilized. The landing was uneventful.Personally; this was too close for me. I understand this is a busy place but we had a Controller; another Pilot who should have seen us; and clearance for an ILS approach. The only thing that saved us from hitting that aircraft was the TCAS. We were down to one slice of swiss cheese preventing us from what could have been a major accident. Please talk to ATC and see if there's a learning point for them in this.  We did everything by the book and we almost got killed. Thank the Lord for TCAS and for our airline that has worked so hard on this training for so long. It paid off in spades today and I am thankful for all of you in Safety."

On takeoff from LAX on the ORCA5 departure; we were cleared for takeoff behind an Aircraft Y on the same SID. When we were cleared for takeoff I thought; 'Wow; that guy has just gotten airborne. I haven't been cleared for departure this close behind an aircraft in as long as I can remember!' I then thought; 'Well; the Aircraft Y is smaller than we are; so we should probably be OK.'Shortly after liftoff in IMC; we encountered the Aircraft Y wake turbulence. I had to correct to overcome the rolling tendency; quite a bit actually. A few seconds later; we encountered it again; this time as we were climbing through the tops of the marine layer. We could see the swirling vortex of the wake turbulence in the tops of the clouds and once again; I had to work to overcome the rolling tendency. I thought 'Wow; that would not have been a good thing if we were dealing with an engine failure at the same time; especially during the IMC encounter at the lower altitude!'As we were switched over to Departure frequency; I told Tower about the wake encounter and I think I mentioned how it was a very close proximity between our aircraft departures.

I departed ZZZ in an SF50 aircraft with X souls on board. Shortly after departure; at approximately 3;000 ft. and not long after we had been handed off to the departure frequency listed on the DP; I received a warning CAS message that read; 'FUEL VALVES BOTH FAIL.' No other abnormal indications were observed. Immediately; I pulled up the appropriate checklist and completed it. The checklist advised me to check the fuel quantity; maintain airspeed for adequate roll control; and land as soon as possible. I called the Departure Controller we had been speaking to and advised him that; per the checklist; we needed to land back at ZZZ. He asked what the nature of the concern was; and I let him know that we had received a warning message regarding our fuel valves; and that the checklist advised us to land as soon as possible. He also asked if we would be needing any emergency services; to which I said no.At this time; I did not intend to [request priority handling] myself; as we still had fuel flow (the valves fail to the open position); and I knew that a possible eventual fuel imbalance was the pressing concern; but that due to our proximity to the airport; we should be on the ground before that would become an issue. However; out of precaution; the Departure Controller advised me that they would be [giving us priority handling]. Following this; the Controller asked us how we would like to be vectored back; and I requested vectors to final for a visual approach to Runway XXL. We joined the approach and landed with no issues. On the ground; we were met by the ARFF team; who inspected the aircraft from their trucks; and let us taxi back to the ramp once they had visually assessed the exterior of the aircraft. The occurrence turned out to be somewhat of a non-event due to quick use of checklists; utilization of resources including assistance from ATC; as well as help from my safety pilot (who was able to alert our company of the occurrence; and assist me in other tasks; such as calculating lbs of fuel on board).

While flying about 7 NM west southwest of SHD airport under VFR; I had a near-miss with a drone. The drone passed above my plane by about 35 ft. I was maintaining a visual scan for traffic in accordance with recommended FAA procedures. However; because the drone was so small; I didn't see it until it was just passing above me; leaving no time to react. The drone appeared to be black and blue in color. To prevent this from happening again; I feel the FAA should place stricter regulations on drone operators as well as teach other pilots how to scan the sky for smaller flying objects such as drones. Additionally; I hope the FAA will investigate this incident as it could have resulted in serious injury to me or my passengers.

So I assumed the dry ice marking was incorrect; scanned the Important package & entered the listed weight & loaded the package into the A1 compartment. I found out today that the package was an actual Dangerous Goods (DG) when I was told I would have to answer some questions by management. I was loading the plane & thought this was just another important medical shipment and made sure it was on the flight.

Weather exploded east of ELP; traffic quickly began to overwhelm the controller on Sector X who was working Aircraft X. Frequency congestion was a nightmare; the gigantic sector; the multiple transmitter sites; the planes all calling to deviate; and the bottleneck around ELP; Mexico; White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The Controller was extremely busy; I was listening to him go down the tubes. I started out on the D-side on Sector Y and we were quickly in the same boat as the Controller on Sector X. Sector X Controller realized too late that Aircraft X was deviating north towards [Restricted Area] R-XXXX which was active FL300 and below. After taking the hand off; I realized the same thing; the Sector X Controller gave a hard vector south to a 190 heading and used the term immediately. I saw conflict alert go off with the Aircraft operating in R-XXXX; which we think was a military drone. The TCAS didn't go off on Aircraft X. The Pilot of Aircraft X checked on stating he turned south to miss a drone; not sure if that was an evasive maneuver or from the heading given from the Sector X Controller. We had to go into no notice holding as we got so busy; we couldn't insure separation of aircraft from each other or the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The weather quickly built and traffic quickly overwhelmed the SE specialty. Command Center / Traffic Management Unit (TMU) constantly neglect the complexity of us working traffic through this area. There is a lot of pressure for us to not hold; not lower the map numbers; not route planes north. I would recommend that we have a specific Pro-day for the SE and SW specialties to practice different routes and holding scenarios; and also have upper management encourage us to take this action sooner rather than waiting and trying just 'make it work' or 'just get through this shift'. There is a pernicious attitude that pervades both the SE; management; Traffic Management Unit and ZAB as a whole to never do this; that we change this culture.

At approximately XA30 local at ZZZ; as Pilot Monitoring; upon rotation we received an inadvertent stall and shaker warning once the wheels left contact with the ground. Our IAS was approximately 80 kts. and increasing passed 100 throughout the time the shaker and stall warning was going off. I took the controls from my SIC and became Pilot Flying as PIC and inhibited the pusher; and pulled the pusher circuit breaker as well. All other indications refuted a stall and we were unable to land immediately; we continued our climb into the upwind and [requested priority handling]; reentered the pattern and successfully landed without incident on Runway XX. Upon landing we exited the Runway and taxied back to the FBO without further incident; after alerting ATC of our [incident]; safe return; and cancellation of our flight plan.

On DATE; myself and another technician were tasked with a CAT (Category) II functional check on Aircraft X. Both of us worked on setting up for the task and going over the steps for the functional check. After the functional check; both of us removed the equipment that was needed for the check. I didn't install the static-port screws into the static ports; but assumed that the other technician did. The other technician wasn't signed off on the CAT II functional check; so the two of us stamped all the blocks of the work card.On Date 1; I was notified that the static port screws weren't installed. I will insure that this issue doesn't happen again by verifying the aircraft condition before stamping the work card. Also; I think this issue can be eliminated by making the removal of the air-data kit; a RII (Required Inspection Item) item; for this work card.

During Cruise Flight at FL430 the aircraft experienced multiple electronics and avionics failures. Crew responded via maintaining control of the aircraft and running the appropriate checklists and after a brief discussion we [advised ATC] and asked to divert. Checklist final item was 'land nearest suitable'.We were closest to ZZZ but due to loss of anti-icing controls and the multiple overcast freezing layers over ZZZ we asked ATC for weather at nearby airports. We chose ZZZ1 due to its proximity and higher ceilings as well as broken layers; not overcast so we could avoid icing conditions during the descent as well as the lack of significant crosswind for Runway XX.ATC vectored us to the RNAV XX approach and we landed without incident.The root cause was a loss of MAU2A (Modular Avionics Unit) due to CB failure. Significant items lost included anti-ice control; AT; AP; Spoiler Control; MCDU2; FMS1; AHRS2 and ADC2; Gear Status Indication. The aircraft was flying fine; however the computer systems were no longer able to verify the accuracy of data input so many systems were considered 'unreliable'. For example; engine anti-ice fails to on; but we have no way of knowing if they were working or not. The same for gear. We lost gear indication and despite feeling and hearing the gear deploy; we asked ZZZ1 Tower to confirm gear down while on 3 mile final. Given confirmation; we continued with the landing in lieu of a fly-by.Things that went right: The Pilot Flying did an excellent job maintaining control of the aircraft at all times; freeing me up to concentrate completely on checklists; navigation; and setting up for the approach and landing. ATC provided excellent services giving our arrival priority and providing any information we requested. One significant bonus to [advising ATC] was that ATC knew I would not be able to answer radio calls immediately. This relieved a major stress factor (distraction) in a near task saturated environment. Thank you ZZZ Center; Approach and ZZZ1 Tower! In addition; company X has done an excellent job training us for this particular situation. Aside from a dual generator failure; this particular failure may be one of the most stressful. FS ZZZ2 did an excellent job of preparing us for this exact situation.Things that went wrong: One of the things we lost was Gear Status indication. The checklist says that lack of an aural warning after gear down and flaps 35 indicates that the gear is properly deployed. In the simulator; this makes perfect sense. However; in the actual airplane on final for an actual landing; it does not feel quite as comfortable. Pilots are used to a positive indication of gear down. In this case; it was a lack of negative indication that we needed to rely on. These are not the same thing. I am not sure what the solution would be; but during the entire event - the gear situation was the one we were most uncomfortable with.In 30 years of flying; this was the first time I ever [requested priority handling]. Due to excellent assistance from ATC; excellent training; and a professional calm response from both crew members - it was a non-event.

I was en route on an IFR flight plan from ZZZ to ACK. I was talking to Boston Approach on 188.2. ATC initially routed me direct at 3;000 ft; and later cleared me direct to HOKEL (heading ~ 160 degrees) for the RNAV 15 at ACK. Approximately 2nm NE of FMH; I entered IMC in cumulus clouds. I briefly exited and re-entered clouds once or twice. Around XA:44; ATC instructed me to descend to 2;000ft in preparation for the approach. The next events occurred over approximately one minute. During the descent; ATC reported 'Military traffic 12 o'clock; less than 3 miles; orbiting at 3;000ft' I responded 'looking for traffic; but I am in the clouds.' About 20 seconds later ATC stated 'I don't know why they are descending; turn right heading 240' I set the autopilot to turn to 240 and repeated the instructions to ATC. Shortly thereafter; ATC gave another traffic call with more urgency in his voice; 'Traffic 12 o'clock; less than a mile; appears to be descending; indicating 2;200; turn right 240.' Again I repeated 'right 240'. A few seconds later ATC gave new instructions 'Traffic is now turning; turn left 150' and I set my autopilot to 150 and repeated the instruction. Around this time I checked my ACAS (traffic screen) and saw a Traffic Advisory symbol overlaid on the own aircraft symbol showing -3. This indicates that the aircraft was very close and about 300 feet below my aircraft. A few seconds after beginning the turn to 150; we exited the clouds and immediately saw a military airplane. The aircraft was less than 500 feet below us and offset from us by only a 100 feet or so. The aircraft was in a nose-low right bank and passed beneath us and out of view. I reported 'traffic in sight' to ATC and was then returned back on track to HOKEL and completed the rest of the flight uneventfully.

Aircraft X departed ZZZ on a SID. The aircraft was not flying the procedure correctly and in doing so was creating a traffic situation with an arrival on an instrument approach. I observed the identifier and turned aircraft to avoid traffic. I also verified which procedure the pilot was flying. Even though I had radar identified the aircraft I forgot to tell the pilot he was [in] radar contact. The pilot continued to have problems following headings then I noticed a 360 turn and the pilot was having trouble with his altitude. I had the Controller In Charge tell ZZZ of the situation because it looked like the aircraft was going to crash. I asked the pilot if he [needed assistance] and could he just level the plane. He did and regained some control of [the] aircraft. Overall the plane lost autopilot all navigation; gyro; directional gyro; horizontal situation indicator. I climbed the pilot to VFR conditions with no gyro vectors to VMC. We then got him going to VFR airport. Landed safe with ZZZ1 center.During this event ZZZ contacted a pilot who has flown this aircraft. He said this plane did this last week. He helped us and the pilot troubleshoot during the event. My suggestion is why wasn't the plane fixed. Was it worked on? Was the pilot notified of the occurrence before? ZZZ FBO in my opinion does some things I don't like for cost savings and I hope this wasn't one of them. I don't know if the plane was worked on or not. I hope this is investigated. The pilot of Aircraft X almost lost his life in an out of control spiral and could have crashed and might have crashed into an arriving aircraft as well.

Departed ZZZ with IFR flight plan to GYY with destination of C77. Cancelled IFR with South Bend Approach due to no access to Chicago Class B airspace for GA flights. Climbed to 10.5 to go over top of Chicago Class B and approaching Lake Michigan requested VFR flight following to remain within gliding distance of the shoreline. Shortly thereafter was vectored by ATC to turn further north whereby I advised ATC this was beyond gliding distance to shore. As a condition of continued ATC flight following services I had to accept the turn or services would be terminated. So continued the flight out of gliding distance of the shoreline for approximately 7 minutes while asking for easterly turn toward the shoreline. Floatation/lifevest on board does not make this a safe or acceptable practice.Proceeded over the top of Chicago Class B at 10.5 navigating direct to C77 Poplar Grove and three 737s at 11000 caused wake turbulence advisories to be issued by ATC. After flying through the first wake I requested descent and with no traffic below/ahead ATC refused the descent approval to enter the Chicago Class B. Continued through wake of 2nd 737 however avoided the 3rd 737. My flight was trapped between the top of the Class B at 10;000 ft. and heavy traffic at 11;000 ft. resulting in an unsafe condition with no clear solution.Chicago ATC practice is to exclude GA aircraft from Class B access as a standard practice even though no published policy exists in the TRACON facility manual. This exclusion of GA aircraft from Class B access created the above unsafe flight operations for this flight and creates unnecessary risk for GA aircraft operations daily.A survey I took of GA pilots in the Chicago area found the above over water and wake turbulence exposure risks occur on occasion. Please use this report as the basis to begin creation of solutions to the above issues.

Roles:Captain: Pilot Monitoring (PM)First Officer (FO): Pilot Flying (PF)Deadhead FO: DH PilotAt approximately XA:20 while approaching way point ZZZZZ on Airway at FL380 the autopilot #2 disengaged with an associated ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF. After an evaluation and finding no cause for the autopilot disengagement the autopilot #2 was re-engaged. Within minutes the aircraft pitched up slightly; as if in mountain wave; climbing approximately 70 ft. above the cruise altitude and an ECAM message F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1 displayed. The aircraft then slightly pitched down to 70 ft. below cruise altitude and immediately ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF; F/CTL ALT LAW (PROT LOST) and F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 2 displayed. Pilot Flying began hand flying the aircraft. We began the ECAM Procedures. I called the #1 Flight Attendant and instructed him to have the deadheading First Officer come to the cockpit immediately. Deadhead Pilot and I re-evaluated the systems failures and determined that the systems/computers could not be recovered. I then [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center and requested FL260 since we could not stay in RSVM airspace without an autopilot. This also allowed a wider airspeed regime between Vmo and Alfa PROT in case pitch control became more of problem. Pilot Flying noted that the control input forces were increasing as we descended at 280 kt. indicated. We attempted to manually trim the aircraft with the pitch trim wheel; but the stabilizer appeared jammed at -0.8 up. I attempted to call Dispatch desk via the Crew Call app but reception was poor. Deadhead pilot looked up the ZZZ Commercial Radio frequency for me and I established communication with the Dispatcher and Airbus Maintenance desk. Maintenance advised us that if there was not a fix in the QRH there was nothing he could do for us. The aircraft was under control and Pilot Flying was able to override the now mistrimmed stabilizer with his side stick. The three of us and the Dispatcher then began discussions on diverting to the closest long runway. Something in the 8;000 to 10;000 ft. length range with airspace enough to configure; evaluate and handle any pitch problems that may present itself as we configured for landing. The four of use decided it was prudent to divert to ZZZ1 which was 140 NM away (120 miles closer than ZZZ2).I [requested priority handling] and informed ZZZZ Center that we were experiencing a flight control problem and request vectors to ZZZ1. ZZZZ gave us an off-airway vectors of 090deg then 100deg so to fly around restricted airspace while ZZZZ called for permission for use to fly through the restricted airspace direct to ZZZ1. I asked Deadhead Pilot to handle the radio communications while I briefed the flight attendant and passengers on the diversion and anticipated non-routine landing. The flight attendants were briefed for a non-routine landing. When done with cabin briefings and passenger address my attention returned to Pilot Flying and Deadhead Pilot. By this time; we had been handed off to ZZZ Center. I found that we were still flying the 100 degree heading. I queried ZZZ Center for the reason of this extended vector and was told it was because of restricted airspace to our north. I firmly reminded the Controller we were an aircraft in distress with flight control problem [and] that we had [requested priority handling] and if this vector continues; we're going to have fuel problems. I informed him this diversion was becoming pointless since the object of the diversion was to get this aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. I added that I could have been in ZZZ3 by now. We were immediately given a north heading towards ZZZ2.Approximately 20 minutes before landing passing 15;000 ft. (SAT-26) the pitch trimwheel lurched nose down a few inches and began trimming normally. Pilot Flying commented that side stick input forces became normal. The stabilizer continued to trim normally during all speed and configurations changes as flaps were extended. The ECAM messages remained displayed. Deadhead Pilot had completed a landing distance assessment using a non-normal; DIRECT LAW calculation. (Note: A non-normal; stabilizer jam calculation resulted in the same distance) We asked for and received a 20 NM final approach. We completed our applicable checklists and informed the Flight Attendants that we were 10 minutes from landing.Pilot Flying; Deadhead Pilot and I briefed that we would be fully configured and 160 kts. prior to gear extension so that only small a small amount of pitch trim would be required to stabilize the approach when the flight control system degrades to DIRECT LAW. Pilot Flying landed the aircraft perfectly and we rolled out; turned off the runway to taxi to the gate. Pilot Flying commented the aircraft required a firmer side stick input to flare due to the Direct Mode. I made a passenger address assuring them of our safety and thanking them for their cooperation with the Flight Attendant's instruction.I met with the Mechanic meeting our flight and briefed him on our experienced. He was grateful we had stayed to discuss the failures with him. When we blocked in and shut down the engines all the ECAM messages had cleared and only an ECAM Class II F/CTL indication remained. The faults remained in the Multipurpose Control Display Unit>Maintenance>Current Flight Report print out. Deadhead Pilot and I had operated Aircraft X/DATE that morning down to ZZZZ1. Starting the initial decent on the ZZZZZ1 2A STAR into ZZZZ1 we had experienced three autopilot disconnects. The first two occurred prior to the way point ZZZZZ3 on the STAR. ZZZZZ3 was to be crossed between FL230 and FL210. Prior to the third disconnect I saw the pitch trim wheel jerk forward approximately an inch. An ECAM warning would flash on the display then disappear. Descending below FL180 the autopilot was re-engaged and was used for the remainder of the STAR and RWY XXR LOC and GS capture. The pitch trim worked normally as we slowed on the arrival and configured for landing.At gate arrival in ZZZZ1; we called for Maintenance and described what we experienced. Maintenance printed a Maintenance Current Flight Report from the Multipurpose Control Display Unit which indicated warns of XU:23 AUTO FLT AP OFF and XU:27 F/CTL. Failure messages were: XU:21 AFS:ELAC1 and XU:25 AFS:ELAC1. There was a Class II Maintenance Message F/CTL displayed on the Status page. Maintenance went to work clearing these faults.I could not have hopped for a better qualified crew to meet this challenge. I had flown with Deadhead Pilot before; but this was my first flight with Pilot Flying. Deadhead Pilot brought 30 years of Airbus experience to the flight deck including time at various airlines. Pilot Flying brought 22 years of Airbus experience to the flight. Their performance was both profession and stellar. They never stopped working the problem. Flight Attendant 1; Flight Attendant 3; Flight Attendant 4 worked as a team preparing our passengers for a non-routine landing and keeping communications to the cockpit to a minimum during this diversion allowing us to work the problem uninterrupted. I would recommend that Dispatch and Commercial Radio VHF frequency pages found in the FOM be included in the QRH for easier referencing.

Auto Pilot failed in turn to intercept LOC for ILS 4R into EWR during Fist Officer's leg. Aircraft was in a left turning descent when Auto Pilot failed (possibly due to wake -rolling motion- from 767 ahead). Was unable to reengage Auto Pilot momentarily (5-10 seconds) [and] during this time aircraft continued left turn and descent briefly causing an RA for a helicopter below and to the west of aircraft's position. ATC was informed. Corrective action was taken and aircraft was returned to heading and altitude for LOC intercept. Auto Pilot did reengage successfully moments after this occurred once established on the ILS. Avoid aircraft wake and remain vigilant while monitoring.

Aircraft X came over to my frequency well outside my airspace at 17;000 feet requesting a ZZZ full stop. I gave him a pilot's discretion descent to 2;100 feet for the approach with a turn to the final approach course. By the time I noticed the rapid rate of descent and tried to stop the descent he was too low for radio coverage and may or may not have heard me. He continued to descend to an altitude that was below the MVA more than 40 miles from our radar site. After several attempts to re-establish communications he switched to my UHF frequency and I climbed him back up to 3;000 feet which is 300 feet above the MVA until he was within 40 miles of our radar site. At that point I brought him back down to 2;100 feet to clear an obstacle north of ZZZ1 airport.  In the future I will avoid pilot's discretion descents that far outside of our airspace. If I do I will make sure that the altitude issued will meet the MVA outside 40 miles of our radar site in case of a rapid descent. Typically pilot's will slow their rate of descent with pilot's discretion so that they can stay at an altitude which will conserve fuel. That was not the case in this event.

We did the appropriate paperwork and prepared to depart ZZZ for ZZZ1. Picked up our clearance and departed. At some point in the climb we became aware of an odor distinctly that of gasoline. After discussing the notable lack of HAZMAT paperwork and the implications of such an odor we made the decision to turn around. Re-briefed the approach and our plan; called ZZZ Center and requested direct to the IAF for the ILS which we then performed as normal. After arriving back at the airport we opened the cargo door to inspect the cargo and locate the culprit. Upon doing so we discovered a shipment of gas cans (Jerry Jugs) that had not been cleaned properly. We removed them; searched the rest of the load for anything else that we should have been notified of its presence; removed what we could find; and redid the weight and balance. Filed a new flight plan; and departed once more for ZZZ1. The rest of the flight went without incident. A company mandated return report was filed with the appropriate operational personnel.

I was ramp checked on Date. All my paperwork was in order. The Inspector requested I email him a photo of my aircraft's most current annual inspection. When I was reviewing my logs to make sure everything was clear for the Inspector; I recognized I had misread the propellers AD. I believed I had 500 hours from the previous inspection before the propeller had to be inspected next. The propeller have less than 150 hours since the AD was complied with.

Flying the FMS Bridge visual 28R approach into SFO approaching San Mateo bridge; received a traffic alert on TCAS.  Autopilot was engaged; exactly on our path; and flaps 20 with gear up.  Identified a light civil aircraft below and to our left.  That traffic was consistent with traffic we routinely see coming out of San Carlos (SQL) airport.  Was comfortable that we would pass over the traffic and instructed my First Officer to select TA position on the TCAS.  As that aircraft disappeared under our nose we were descending through approx. 1;800 feet and I noted a separation of 400 feet on TCAS.  Directly over that aircraft I noted 300 feet on TCAS as we descended through approx. 1;700 feet.  Notified tower of the traffic; and proceeded to normal landing.  Upon landing notified tower that we believed separation of 300 feet complied with definition of NMAC and we would be filing a NMAC report.

Reduced PL (Power Lever) to FI in descent. #1 Torque was 31 percent with PL in FI (Flight Idle). Crew considered directional control loss during approach and after landing. Contacted Ops and agreed with inflight #1 engine shutdown for single engine landing. Shut down #1 engine at 4;000 feet and requested ATC vector to ILS. Safely landed and taxied to ramp. FO (First Officer) was flying pilot and started descent from 16;000 feet to 4;000 feet. FO reported CA (Captain) that #1 torque was 31 percent with PL in FI. #2 torque was zero with PL in FI. Crew had reported company several times that #1 Torque gauge indicated 20 percent higher than normal level in cruise with PL in notch. Mechanics troubleshot it and airplane returned to service. The problem happened in first flight after this troubleshooting.Crew analyzed risk and consequences to approach and land with this condition and informed company necessity for in flight #1 engine shutdown for safe landing. Then; CA took control and FO asked company whether we should land at ZZZ1 or ZZZ. Company selected ZZZ and FO requested ATC to vector to set up ILS XX and conduct all necessary checklists. Then; airplane landed on Runway X with single engine safely and taxied to hanger on its own power. Performance test should be done after troubleshooting prior to returning it to revenue flight. If a check flight or a reliability flight after the maintenance was completed; this incident might be prevented.

While supervising the unload in ZZZ a piece of hazmat that was not seen during the loading process in ZZZ1 was discovered. The hazmat was a class 2 non-flammable gas which should initially have been reported on the pilot notification form.While supervising the unload in ZZZ the hazmat was noticed for the first time. I believe this package went unnoticed while checking the information on a separate box of hazmat.The nature of the hazmat was noted and I called Safety to verify it was hazmat that should have been reported and find out how to proceed. I think this hazmat slipped past me on the belt loader while I was looking at a separate piece of hazmat to add to the pilot notification form. Next time the best idea may be to momentarily pause the loading process when looking at hazmat so nothing goes undetected.

Aircraft X was on final approach to ZZZ. The crew received an asymmetric flap indication upon final approach. The crew went around and re-configured the aircraft for landing. The aircraft then landed in ZZZ without incident. Upon landing it was discovered that the inboard slats did not extend; and the outboard flaps had extended fully.

Upon leveling off at our cruise altitude; the Captain and I noticed the trailing edge flap indicator had a split between left and right flap. One was indicating fully up while the other was beyond that showing that it was even 'more up' than the limit. Upon further discussion we agreed that it was probably an indication issue as it's impossible for the flaps to be split in that manner. We decided to extend the flaps early on descent in case of any issues with deployment. At around 10;000 MSL I called 'flaps 1'. The Captain moved the flap/slat handle to the 1 position. There was no indication of motion of flaps or LED's. I remained the flying Pilot and took over the radios after we requested priority and requested a Runway (XXC) from Regional Approach at ZZZ. The Captain and I had a brief discussion on which checklist to use. We agreed on flap asymmetry since that was what the indicator was depicting. We were able to get the LED's extended fully and land via the trailing edge flaps up checklist. Upon landing we taxied to the gate normally with Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting following. Worth note is that after landing the trailing edge flap indicator reverted back to normal.I'm not sure what caused the trailing edge flaps to not extend.

Aircraft X came off of Runway XXL and asked to go to the ARC from ZZZZZ for the ILS to Runway XXL. They were climbing to 3000 ft. from the missed approach. I thought that I had issued a climb to 4000 feet for the antenna obstructions that were on the ARC. The low altitude alert went off and I issued the low altitude alert and issued a climb to 4000 ft. I should have made sure that the aircraft was climbing to 4000 ft. to ensure that it was the altitude for the antenna obstructions.

After an uneventful run-up and takeoff on runway XXL at ZZZ following outlined Diamond DA40-180 procedures found in the approved DA40 AFM; at roughly 100 AGL on climb out; established in a Vy climb the airplane experienced a sudden complete power loss from the single power plant. I immediately took controls from my student who was the pilot flying at the time. Pitched the aircraft forward to prevent the stall warning horn from activating as I saw the airspeed quickly reduce close to a speed that would induce the stall warning horn.I then told the Tower the aircraft was having engine issues and that I was going to land straight ahead. Prior to flare entry; at a stabilized airspeed of roughly 68 kts. I extended the flaps from the normal takeoff position to the landing position. I performed a normal landing with remaining runway and partially exited runway XXL at taxiway 1. Tower immediately told the aircraft on approach to the same runway behind me to go around and asked me if there was anything they could do for me. After the aircraft came to a stop I told them to contact the FBO that services our flight school to get a tug to pull us back to the ramp.After a few minutes Tower asked if we thought we could get the airplane started again. I tried several attempts; switching tanks; using and not using the boost electric pump and different throttle settings. On the initial restart attempt I immediately smelled the strong odor of 100LL avgas. Airport personnel drove up to the airplane and I helped them move the airplane off the runway. My student went back to where we initially came to a stop and noticed that there was a large amount of fuel pooled on the pavement. After a tow back to the FBO; maintenance personnel spent about an hour looking at the engine.I was told roughly 2 hours after the accident by the flight school's Chief Flight Instructor that after a swap of fuel distribution manifolds between the DA40 we were in and another flight school DA40; the maintenance technician incorrectly installed the fuel line fitting that connects the fuel line from the fuel tanks to the distribution manifold by cross threading the connection between the fuel line and the fuel line fitting. The fuel pressure produced by run-up; taxi and initial takeoff did not exceed the force required to dislodge the cross threaded connection; however; once initial takeoff power was sustained; climb power and fuel pressure were established; the connection failed. The airplane completed the corrective service and was test flown shortly after and returned to service.I regularly practice aborted takeoffs after rotation and on initial climb out with my students. Due to the training; I felt proficient exercising the actions that I performed. In the moment I was entirely focused on flying the airplane; however if I had to attempt it over again I would have tried to switch tanks possibly. Both my mixture and electric boost pump were functioning properly; as verified during the run-up and they were already confirmed several times prior to takeoff to be in the correct positions. I was unaware maintenance had been performed on the airplane; but I think from now on I will execute flights following maintenance events with extreme caution; specific relating to the initial takeoff I will use as much runway as I possibly can and will verify my engine parameters on takeoff by introducing takeoff power while holding the brakes prior to beginning my takeoff as one would normally perform for a short field takeoff.

Flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 in PA-18. Persons on Board; pilot only. AWOS announced 10 kts. from 090. Flew left pattern to Runway 8. Right pattern is listed on charts. On downwind leg; noticed wind direction had clocked a bit more right. Anticipated a right crosswind on final. Base leg and final leg was nominal. The engine was in full idle (less than 600 RPM) upon landing; received a gust from the right which lifted the right wing and veered the aircraft to the left. Corrected with rudder and put in more right aileron. Recall that the stick was perhaps not in the far back right corner i.e. not full down elevator. Aircraft corrected to right and turn accelerated despite left rudder applied. As the tail of the aircraft started to get to the point that it might be to the left of the main wheels; I became concerned of a loss of control.At this point; the aircraft had slowed significantly and I thought a slight application of the brakes might improve the situation. The aircraft tail slowly lifted and then unfortunately went past the CG (Center of Gravity) and the aircraft nosed over completely. After shutting down the master and magnetos; I exited the aircraft and with the aid of a bystander we lifted the nose and moved the aircraft from the runway. Not giving full elevator authority resulted in the tail wheel not having sufficient traction to maintain directional control once the aircraft slowed past the effectiveness of the rudder. Application of brakes with elevator not in full authority allowed the tail to be light enough to allow the aircraft to nose over.

Was participating in an event at ZZZ. Pattern was much busier than normal and Tower was issuing rapid fire instructions to aircraft in the pattern and approaching the D. I was flying a right downwind for Runway XX and was told I was number 2 in the sequence behind a Skyhawk. I identified the traffic to follow and began my turn to base shortly after. Upon turning on to a base leg; I saw another aircraft on final. I believe the tail number began with XX and the tail was narrow like a Diamond type; though I am not certain at all.The tail was directly in front of me; so I turned away from final to a 224 heading away from the runway. My first transmission was to report that we had gotten quite close to the other traffic and that I had broken out of the sequence. The Controller came back in an exasperated tone and said they had instructed me to follow the Skyhawk. I didn't respond right away; but then told the Controller I was on a 224 heading and I was fine if I needed to go back to the beginning of the pattern to re-enter the sequence. The Controller indicated I should continue flying westbound and standby for further instructions. Shortly after the Controller asked me if I had visual contact with a helicopter and I reported negative contact. I was still headed away from the airport and did not have them in sight behind me. The Controller told me to turn in and the remainder of the approach to landing was completed without incident.I don't recall anyone in the pattern being asked to visually identify other aircraft prior to my conflict with the other aircraft on final. The traffic I believed I was following was issued a landing clearing shortly before I turned on to base. I suspect the third aircraft in the sequence turned in before I did from the opposing base. For my own part; I was definitely concerned with the amount of traffic in the pattern as it was far beyond what I had experienced in the 18 months prior while flying at this airport. I also had a youthful passenger as a part of the [event]. I have flown this type of mission previously and I didn't feel particularly stressed about that piece; but it is unusual for me to fly with a passenger. I was well rested and ready for this flight. I also felt like I had a good idea of the sequence I was to follow; but I could be incorrect about specifically being assigned #2. I don't think that is the case; but I acknowledge it's possible.

I was conducting a flight instruction flight with [a student]. It was [students] first flight and this was considered a discovery flight. We had gone around the west side of ZZZ1 past ZZZ2 and were headed back to ZZZ3. [Student] was flying at this time as I was trying to let him fly as much he could handle it. The engine got a little noisier and then seemed quite rough. I immediately took controls and began to fly the aircraft. I was checking the engine instruments and noticed the RPM was dropping but everything else looked fine. At first we only lost a couple hundred RPM. After a few minutes we began losing more and more RPM. This first started over the ZZZ4 near the center of the island of ZZZ1. At this point I turned to set up for a base at ZZZ which was not too far ahead. I immediately contacted ZZZ Tower and told them I would be landing on their airfield. This was a military airfield. They cleared me to land at first. I was slowly losing altitude and more and more RPM as I approached ZZZ. When I turned final at ZZZ I got a little boost in RPM. At this time ZZZ also said that I could not land at a military airfield unless it was a priority and there would be lots of paperwork. I at that point [requested priority handling] and said I would try to maintain altitude to see if it was getting better. However; the engine sputtered again and I told ZZZ that I would be landing. I was a little high so I circled at the approach end and landed the plane. I believe I did the right thing in this situation. Something that I could have improved on was maintaining best; glide speed. However; the engine still had some power. I also probably should have put the plane down and not tried to delay the inevitable when I got the boost of RPM. Even if the plane began to fly normally after that; I would still be landing at ZZZ because of the previous occurrences. I also think that being at 2500 ft. Helped me in this case. If I were even at 2000 ft. I might not have made the runway at ZZZ. Also; I was previously in the military so the military airfield was not that intimidating to me. However; the way ZZZ mentioned on short final that there would be lots of paperwork may have scared some people. So I like to tell people to not be intimidated by military airfields and that an airfield should always be the first option in engine failure.

On descent into LAX we were on the Ironman arrival and had the RNAV RNP Z 24R approach loaded into the FMS. We anticipated connecting DAHJR on the approach/arrival together as we had done nearly every time during the previous flights into LAX during this trip. ATC advised us that they were too busy to accommodate the RNAV and told us to expect the visual approach. On downwind they told us to descend to 2;600 at 210kts which we did and extended flaps to 1. While still at a relatively high altitude; approach told us to turn base. At this point the CA (PF) selected 200kts manual speed and called for flaps 2 and continued descending in Vertical Navigation Mode and Flight Level Change (VFLC). We could see the airport and knew we were high so he verbalized that he would square off his base turn to give us more time to descend. Right after that; approach gave us a turn to final which cancelled that plan we had made. At this point we were still too high and I was thinking we would probably end up going around. The Captain (CA) called for the gear down and additional flaps. I know he was using spoilers but I don't remember when or how much they were used. The Visual Glide Path (VGP) was still well below us so the CA disconnected the autopilot and manually pitched down to catch it. At this point the VSI increased as he focused on getting the glideslope. The RAD ALT called out 2500 feet and I assumed he would start to arrest his descent but he did not do so quickly enough. I remember at 1700 feet AGL seeing -2100FPM. I tried to think of what to say that would convey the issue I was seeing and all I could think to say was 'sink rate' and he acknowledged but I don't think he fully understood me or the situation. ATC also called us to warn us of a 'Low altitude alert' which I think was caused by the excessive descent rate. The CA had the spoilers stowed by 1200 feet and we were on glideslope at this point. I believe the rest of the approach was within the stabilized approach criteria after this point.

While conducting a flight review in VFR conditions; we departed Runway 30 at SMQ to remain in the traffic pattern.  After making a CTAF call; we entered the left downwind for Runway 30.  An ADS-B alert on my iPad alerted to traffic at our same altitude off our right wing just as we rolled out in the downwind.  I immediately took the controls to raise the right wing only to see another small aircraft intercepting our flight path at our altitude.  I immediately made the decision to make a steep left hand turn to avoid a potential collision.  After the turn to avoid was made it was noted that the same aircraft made a turn to follow; so we made another steep turn to evade the aircraft.This aircraft was not entering the traffic pattern but rather crossing mid field of the airport at pattern altitude.  ADS-B shows this aircraft proceeding to a different airport 20 miles north.  The other aircraft gave no indication that they had seen our aircraft at any time during the incident nor were they communicating on the CTAF frequency.

We were set to execute the ILS 28C which is what the ATIS was reporting. After contacting Chicago Approach; they informed us to expect the RNAV (GPS) 27R. We updated the FMS with RNAV 27R and briefed the approach. VOR updating was turned off. While on Radar vectors; we were given Direct Welev to join the Final for 27R. After joining the final; I notice that my LNAV was indicated full left defection. The VNAV was full up defection; which would be normal since we were below the crossing altitude.At this point; I heard ATC questioning the aircraft ahead of us about their tracking. I took a look at [the] First Officer indication and saw no LNAV/VNAV indication. We both were baffled and could not figure it out. While discussing the matter with FO; aircraft ahead of us did a go around. Shortly after that; we did the same and requested the ILS 28C. Rest of the flight was uneventful; ILS 28C was executed with no issues. After further discussion with FO; we determined that we were perfectly setup for the RNAV 27R approach. Not only did the aircraft ahead of us go around; but so did the aircraft behind us. ATC called me to ask what occurred. I told them what is on this report. They were not sure as to the problem with this approach. ATC controller asked if I thought this was related to 5G. I told him that I did not know.

Upon arriving at the aircraft; the Captain and myself reviewed the logbook. Upon review; we found a previously written up ELAC fault; and a failure of an elevator servojack. Both of these write ups had been cleared. We noted that the write up of the elevator servojack indicated that the aircraft had reverted into Alternate Law. During our cockpit preparations; a Flight Control Class II message appeared; was written up; and placed on MEL.While en route; during the course of my normal instrument scan; I noticed that an ECAM had appeared for F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; indicating a fault of the Yellow elevator servojack. I should note that the aircraft did not provide any auditory warnings that this ECAM had occurred; leading us to believe that the FWC (Flight Warning Computer) may have failed also.We performed the ECAM actions and reviewed the QRH. This caused us to discuss the fact that this ECAM had been previously written up. We cleared the ECAM item; and shortly thereafter; we saw another ECAM appear.This was the same ECAM of F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; but now the Green elevator servojack was implicated by the fault. As such; we had now lost half the servojacks on the elevator.At this point; we discussed among ourselves the possibility of the aircraft reverting into alternate law; as this had happened to a previous crew in the previous 2 days. As such; we reviewed the alternate law QRH; and setup the aircraft to land flaps 3 in case we experienced a reversion into alternate law later in the flight. We reviewed the landing distance requirements; and after discussing the issue with Maintenance Control and Dispatch via SATCOM; determined we had the requisite landing distance to continue to ZZZ.No further failures occurred; and we landed without incident. Upon arrival; the Captain wrote up both the servojack failures and the FWC not provided any auditory indications of an ECAM.We briefly discussed the failures with a mechanic; and the crew that was taking over the aircraft.At this point; we proceeded to our next aircraft in order to continue our trip. While we were pushing back; we realized that the aircraft we had written up was also pushing back. This leads me to believe the failed system were simply reset and the aircraft returned to service without troubleshooting.

I was the Pilot Flying (PF) and my First officer (FO) Pilot Monitoring (PM). We were about to start our ZZZZZ arrival over ZZZ1. During our cruise systems check; we discovered the oil quantity indication on the ENG2 appeared to be lower than usual. ENG1;16 qt. ENG2; 6.5 qt. I decided to contact Dispatch for a Maintenance Control consultation. This communication with Dispatch was through SATCOM with a few failed attempts at least twice since we got the failure messages on the FMGC and the call dropping or a weak voice from the Dispatcher. I also tried through ZZZ1 Dispatch VHF XXX.X. When I did this; I accidentally tune the frequency on VHF 1 out from ZZZ Center; but flipped the ZZZ frequency back to it.When we finally got hold Maintenance Control through SATCOM; at that time the oil quantity was at 5.5 on ENG2. I explained our situation and concern with Maintenance Control and a possible engine leak and the trend of oil quantity; recommending to divert to ZZZ1 for a precautionary landing. At that present moment we had an ECAM advisory caution for ENG2 oil qty; 5 qt. Since Maintenance Control concurred with our plan for diverting to ZZZ1 we informed to ATC and continued our descent to divert. Another consideration to this decision was the marginal weather at ZZZ2; with light rain and low ceilings with a front coming into the area. The weather at ZZZ1 was VFR. The inflight and customers were briefed for the divert due to oil engine indication. We were vectored around for our sequence into ZZZ1; RNAV XXL. At this time; a priority was not declared yet.As we continued our descent at low power setting; the oil quantity ECAM advisory for ENG2 was still present and decreasing; 4.5qt. At that time; [priority handling was requested] and the inflight were briefed for a code yellow. We started the APU for systems redundancy. Once we were approximately 15 miles final and cleared for the RNAV XXL approach; our oil quantity for ENG2 was as low as 2qt at leveled off and temperature rising; I believe it was 138 C and increasing; if I remember correctly. It was evident; this was an oil engine leak and not an indication issue. Concerned about an engine damage and having an ECAM warning during short final a busy phase of flight; we performed a precautionary engine 2 shutdown; thrust lever 2 idle and engine master 2 off followed by completing the ECAM actions procedures. We continued the approach and the landing was uneventful. Once cleared of the runway; we briefly stopped at the taxiway for fire and rescue staff inspect the engine 2; if there was any visible damage. They discovered no damage but an apparent minor oil leak from the bottom of the engine. It took only a few minutes to asses this situation before we taxied to the gate. Upon arrival; we met with tech ops and gave them details of our situation. They commented that it was good we salvaged the engine; the oil leak was quite visible and evident once the cowlings were open. Finalizing my narrative; in spite of the circumstances; a rapid decreasing oil quantity on ENG2; [First Officer] and I did our best on bringing the airplane safely on the ground at ZZZ1 where the weather was favorable. It was an overwhelming situation trying to get hold of Dispatch or maintenance at the beginning due to the SATCOM connection issue and the time constraint. But at the end everything was accomplished safe and professional.However; in retrospect. I was really concentrated on getting the aircraft on the ground quickly once [priority handling was requested]. I would have emphasize on a potential precautionary engine shutdown during the approach briefing. It seemed that even though that my FO and I had a continuous dialogue and talking out aloud as we were descending to ZZZ1 we saw ourselves making a last minute decision for a precautionary engine shutdown. Perhaps doing the engine shutdown earlier would have gotten more time to review the contingencies for the flight. In-spite of how comfortable I feel flying the A320 this was a definitely a learning experience for me to manage my time accordingly.

Student pilot practicing touch and go approaches at ZZZ. Clear day. Initial ATIS wind 070@4. Directed by ATC to use Runway XXL; left pattern. Two touch and goes; and one go-around prior to the event. I was specifically working on energy management on landing; as I had been finding myself routinely high and fast; leading to extended time over runway to bleed off excess energy. The go-around prior to the incident approach was due to being too high on approach. One factor of note is that the north runway at ZZZ is comparatively short; and given the specific skill I was practicing; I was very mindful of needing to get back in the air quickly or have low threshold for go-around. On final circuit leading to event; ATC was managing an incoming helicopter approach and extended my downwind. When turn to base was approved; I completed turn to base and started a descent. Turned to long final and on a good glideslope. There were some notable updrafts that left me again high; so reduced power; added full flaps; and was back to a stable but steeper glideslope. I noted that tower had informed incoming helicopter that current winds were 050@9kts. Landing was unremarkable. Crossed threshold at approximately 60kts and had fairly smooth landing in first stage of runway though slightly left of centerline. At this point I re-applied full power and glanced down to the flap handle to raise flaps. Felt plane start veering to the left. I was already applying right rudder crosswind correction; and additional rudder due to being left of centerline. I do not specifically remember applying further correction for power but this is fairly automatic; and definitely added more correction when aircraft started veering left. I do not precisely recall subsequent events; but the aircraft continued to veer to the left and began skidding; leaving the left side of the runway in a right skid. I pulled back power at some point. Aircraft continued past the grass area and ultimately came to rest in a ditch along the runway. I had minor injuries (couple of abrasions). I am not certain of the extent of aircraft damage at this point; but I do know that the nose wheel was sheered off and the propeller hit the dirt. Reviewed the case in my mind and with CFI; and I was also able to get information from the state troopers who investigated the scene. My perception was that a gust was lifting my left wind and the aircraft was turning into the wind; but that additional rudder input and crosswind correction was not correcting. The wheel skid evidence actually showed heavy loading on the left main; indicating that the wing was not being lifted and actually probably pushed down by crosswind correction.In reviewing with CFI; I believe the following factors contributed to the event.1) I applied power very quickly after landing and more rapidly than I generally apply power. This was driven by a pre-set perception of short runway and need to get speed to take off; but may have lead to a mismatch in p-factor correction vs power application. 2) Due to the flaps still being down when power was applied; I likely unloaded the landing gear; reducing effectiveness of the nose wheel in helping to correct for the leftward turn.3) There are buildings (and the helicopter pad) to the immediate north-east of the runway. Given wind direction; it is likely that the first part of the runway had stable winds; but the later part of the runway had more abnormal gusts and eddies caused by wind at the time flowing over those structures. I feel it is likely that a gust effect in combination with p-factor effect and further exacerbated by full flaps being down and catching the gusts contributed to the rapid left turning force on the aircraft; while power application unloading the wheels reduced the ability to correct for this.4) As a final point; I was specifically focusing on the quality of my landings. While I had mentally briefed the relative shortness of the runway; effect of temperature (hotday) on aircraft performance; and consideration for need to make an early abort / go-around decision; I was ultimately thinking about the landing; not the subsequent take off; which I think impacted my response time and speed to the event.Potential corrective actions:1) Personally: this is a very important lesson in making slow changes to aircraft state; not feeling rushed and always being willing to just abort a take off. Also the importance of order of operations. While the flaps would have taken a moment to come up; the relative loss of lift and loading of the gear may have allowed for better control.2) Environmentally; the ditch along the runway halted the aircraft; but without this ditch running along the runway; this event would likely have been a runway excursion into the grass but with very little actual damage to the aircraft. Consideration of space around runways particularly around facilities that have significant training traffic with inexperienced pilots who are more likely to make errors may be a useful consideration.

We were number one for a pattern approach to Runway XX at ZZZ. Incident occurred in the left downwind leg of Runway XX. Aircraft Y was observed on ADS-B on a left downwind leg behind us and about 3 NM from the field. The pilot called a base turn for Runway XX while we were still descending in the downwind. We noticed the plane making a turn towards the field on a direct course to collide with us. I made a call on the CTAF asking if the pilot had Aircraft X in front of them in sight. Pilot failed to respond and continued on the course to collide with us. My student had to execute a go around while still in the downwind and climb out of the traffic pattern to avoid collision. The pilot of the other plane was not utilizing see-and-avoid techniques and compromised safety of flight as a result.

Approach to ZZZ last minute changed from Runway XX to the ZZZZZ Visual to Runway XYR. A vector heading was given to join a left downwind with the terrain and the airport in visual contact at all times VMC conditions. On joining the downwind while descending and configuring for landing with the terrain clearly visible off the right of the aircraft a caution alert 'terrain /terrain' was annunciated. This was a momentary alert as the rising ridge on the downwind was well off the horizontal plane of the aircraft and was cleared in seconds. More vigilance should have been given to closure rate while descending in this environment so as not to activate mode 2 GPWS.

Prior to boarding guests for the flight; Name1 informed me that there was 6 large duffel bags that was to be brought on board the cabin by 6 Company guests. (These duffel bags and it's contents were originally placed in the cargo hold but Name2 noticed them since he was working the cargo bay with Company loading cargo.) The duffel bags were to be escorted and monitored by 1 guest each. The guests' escorts and duffel bags were placed and seated in Cabin Zone A. Each duffel bag carried approximately 6-8 lithium ion batteries the size of a laptop battery. Name1 advised that they were packaged fairly well to ensure there was no thermal runways or short circuits that could happen inflight. Apparently each battery pack was packed separately; and was contained separately by its own protective cases with the charges being tape down etc. to prevent thermal. Captain Name advised to monitor the duffle bags at all times throughout the flight. Duffle bags could not fit in overhead bins or underneath the seat due to its size. Each bag was placed (1) per middle seat; of each of middle rows; perspectively Rows #1-6 and tied down in the middle seat with multiple seat belt extensions as needed. The concern to this is the amount of [Containment Bags] available in the cabin that would be needed if in event that there was to be a cause of fire especially if more than one of these duffle bags were to have a thermal runway or short circuits of the batteries it carries. The handling of one of these duffel bags was also a concern due to its size and its weight. Unfortunately I was unable and it was unforeseen for me to take a picture or a video of the duffel bags as needed so that this can be further given a true and correct measurement/point of reference. Name1 did asked myself and Captain Name beforehand if it was alright to bring these duffel bags in the cabin for the flight. I referred to the FAM-Hazmat; Chapter 14; 14.5.6 ; 14;5.7; and 14.5.11. And yes I agreed to it; so as Name at the time. We both agreed to it. At the time Name1 did advise that it should be safe; for Company assured him that the batteries were safely and protectively packaged more than usual that is why the duffel bags were huge in size. In regards to the [Containment Bags] amount onboard; please note for Aircraft X there is only 1 [Type 1] / 1 [Type2] at L1 and 1 [Type1] / 1 [Type2] at R4. There are no additional or extras on board even with the Onboard MX (Maintenance)'s supplies. Post flight; Captain Name did bring it up for he was concern; and he spoke to Name1 further more how the batteries were packaged; etc.

During the top of descent and after the sterile cockpit light was turned ON; i completed the pre-landing compliance check then I sat on my jump seat. Then I received a call from the pilot informing me about having an issue with one of the flaps that stayed flat. The explained to me that they will be following the procedure and it will not cause an emergency; I have to be prepared for a very fast and speedy landing. They said it will look out of normal landing yet it will not be a major issue; however be prepared for any sudden changes. Then I made another announcement in the cabin sharing that we will be expecting a fast and speedy landing according to the Captain and emphasised the importance of keeping their seat belts fastened. Then the Captain made an announcement as well explained in details the technical issue and assured the passengers that everything will be according the procedures and it will not have a negative impact except that the landing will be expected to me fast. After 5 minutes a received an emergency call from the flight deck informing me that we will be touching down in 8 minutes and be prepared. I went through the emergency drill in my head while going through my 60 seconds review. The landing was smooth and there was no sudden or strong impact while the aircraft touched the runway; it was only fast while it was on the ground. Passengers were not affected. There was no shock or sudden agitation in the cabin. During disembarkation; the passengers were smiling and thanked us without showing any concerns or even noticing difference.

After a lengthy wheels up delay we took off on [Runway] XXR and shortly after Takeoff; during climb out phase of flight; (approximately 1;000 ft. MSL) I lost my Primary Flight Instruments/Displays; followed by the failure of all Displays in the cockpit with numerous EICAS cautions prior to EICAS display failure. The First Officer was changing frequencies and making a radio call with ATC when the initial failure happened; but within a few seconds all displays flickered on and then all failed again. I continued to fly using standby instruments until the R GEN eventually carried the electrical load and some of the failures where cleared; but load shedding disabled several items; including as expected; R ELEC HYD pump; UTIL BUSES; etc... When I spoke to the FAs (Flight Attendants) on the initial contact with them while we were initiating the return to ZZZ1; they also confirmed they had lost power in the cabin/galleys. When partial electrical power was established I noticed the L GEN OFF was the only switch that was not a load shed item amongst all the other illuminated lights. At some point early on during the failures we started the APU and the FO (First Officer) ran the L GEN OFF QRH. Once the APU came on line; everything somewhat returned to normal with the exception of the L GEN OFF EICAS. Running the QRH failed to reset the L GEN failure. After checklist completion down to deferred items; I transferred control of the aircraft to the FO and began coordinating with ZZZ1 Station Operations and Maintenance; Dispatch and Maintenance Control; while the FO flew and coordinated with ATC for the return to ZZZ1. We coordinated with ZZZ1 Maintenance about an overweight landing and what that involved with the overweight landing inspection and were assured they could handle that; at which time we elected to return to ZZZ1; versus burning off approximately 2 hours of the 6 hours of fuel we had. We did not [request priority handling]; but initially with all the failures; we anticipated we would and I believe I passed that along to Dispatch; however we never officially declared with ATC. We did inform ATC of our situation; souls on board and fuel remaining and they vectored us out over the [ocean] to get set up for a straight in to the south complex; [Runway] XYL or [Runway] XYR. Initially they wanted us to land on [Runway] XXL; but we requested the south complex and longer runways. We set up for XYR and they gave us XYL; but we requested XYR to avoid another runway change; and subsequently that paid dividends when another Airline closed XYL with a disabled aircraft while we were on final for XYR. I advised the FAs of our issues early on and that we were probably returning the ZZZ1 and subsequently ran [checklist] with them to let them know we were actually returning to ZZZ1. I made a few PAs for the Passengers; assuring them there was no cause for alarm for our return to ZZZ1 and that we were coordinating for another aircraft to take them to ZZZ. Planned and performed an ILS to XYR; transitioned to a Visual (G/S was unreliable); Flaps 30 landing (139 Ref / 145 Target) which was surprisingly smooth and uneventful; including rollout and braking; using maximum reverse thrust. Overweight landing was 213;000 lbs.; 15;000 lbs. over maximum. All brake temps were 2 or less after the flight. Flight/Weather conditions were VMC with haze/smog restricting visibility but not significantly adversely affecting VFR operations. We debriefed Maintenance with all indications we experienced with the electrical failures. Indicated that it seemed to be 15 seconds before the R GEN took the full electrical load with associated load shedding. Also; noted that time compression associated with stress situations during this event might actually reveal the event was less than 15 seconds of electrical failure while flying on standby instruments. We were met and individually evaluated for fitness of duty to continue by ZZZ1 Personnel; debriefed with ZZZ [Personnel] andelected to continue with another aircraft later in the day to ZZZ.

Upon reaching cruising altitude; I reviewed the NOTOC and realized that we did not amend the Dispatch Release prior to departure to add the Hazmat to the remarks section of the Release. The Captain sent a ACARS message to the Dispatcher and we amended the Release electronically.

Local Controller training. Trainee is a former Center Controller CPC now training at Tower; currently with 50% of his base hours for the position. Trainee has a hard time with the position and decision making. I was his instructor for the morning. Local Control trainee clears Aircraft X for takeoff 18L; then line up and wait Aircraft Y and tells them traffic will be crossing downfield. Local Control trainee crosses Aircraft Z at A; crosses another aircraft at 18R and Taxiway Zulu (No Factor) and then tries to cross a second aircraft at 18L while Aircraft X is rolling. Instructor steps in and cancels the second aircraft but did not catch the first one in time. Aircraft X rejects takeoff. As the instructor I take and accept full responsibility for the position. The trainee needs to make better use of memory aids. The responsibility is mine. The trainee made multiple decisions and I failed to keep up.

During takeoff roll; lost CA (Captain) and FO (First Officer) airspeed indications. Standby airspeed indicated properly. Once airborne; ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) messages indicated that the aircraft was in alternate law and had no autopilot or auto thrust. CA and FO had no flight directors. Upon flap retraction; flaps jammed (leading edge slats failed to retract). ECAM displayed use manual pitch trim. Unable to manually trim aircraft pitch. Aircraft was nose-heavy. Required continuous aft stick pressure to maintain level flight. Believe maximum flap/slat speed exceeded. [Requested priority handling]. Returned to ZZZ. Able to configure aircraft to flaps 3. Upon gear extension; regained normal pitch authority. Uneventful landing and rollout. After clearing the runway; flaps retracted normally. Aircraft logbook indicated that the #3 pitot tube had been replaced due to being clogged. The logbook also indicated the aircraft had a hard landing on the previous flight. Multiple system failures. I do not know the cause of the system failures and therefore do not have any suggestions on how to prevent this from happening again. Previous simulator training with simulated systems failures was definitely helpful in this situation.

Flying ILS 9C. At 4000 I noticed the GS signal moving abnormally fast from full up deflection to downward as we intercepted the GS. The movement was so fast the GS captured quickly and the aircraft pitched 5 degrees nose down (AP was on). The FO (First Officer) disconnected the AP but initially continued to follow the FD until I commanded him to pitch up and recover. Once stabilized flight was regained; I noticed an aircraft taxi south across the approach end of the runway on Taxiway Z. We both attributed the erratic GS to this aircraft. Once the aircraft cleared the runway; the signal appeared normal. We continued the approach in VMC. Approximately 2 miles from EZELL; I noticed we were approximately 2200 ft. MSL which is 200 ft. lower than we should have been when on the GS. I attempted to determine what was wrong and visually confirmed we were low by looking at the PAPIs. When we passed EZELL; I noticed we were only 1350 ft. AGL (200-300 lower than we should have been on the GS). I verbalized this to the FO who seemed distracted with the obvious irregularity. We extended the gear and flaps and were fully configured by 1000 ft. The FO disregarded the GS and flew the remaining approach visually. I again noticed another aircraft holding short of [Runway] 9C on Z Taxiway which I assumed caused the GS error. I reported this to ATC which seemed unconcerned and mentioned that an aircraft had not stopped in the correct location. Shortly after; another aircraft; who had heard our transmission; advised ATC that they experienced the same issue. Clearly this is a very unsafe situation and could have numerous consequences. In IMC; we would have gone around. It also may have resulted in a CFIT escape.

I was assigned Aircraft X that had been here for the weekend. I reviewed the log book back to the day the aircraft arrived. I noted that gear pin installation had been written up and the corrective action of removing the gear pins had been signed off. Once arriving at the aircraft I walked around it before beginning my assigned tasks and did not see any gear pins. Before departure time the Captain performed his preflight inspection and he did not see the gear pins. At departure time my partner completed a final walk around while I watched from the nose gear area and he did not see the gear pins. After the aircraft did an air turn back we discovered pins installed in the forward holes of the left and right main landing gear. I can only assume the streamers had been wrapped around the gear links due to the windy conditions we had been experiencing; therefore none of us saw the streamers hanging.

Approximately crossing the final approach fix on the RNAV Y Runway XY approach; with the runway in sight I disconnected the autopilot and proceeded to hand-fly a visual approach to Runway XY. As we descended on the approach we experienced continuous light turbulence and lateral wind-shear which occasionally required more than half-deflection of the ailerons to maintain straight flight. While I had appropriate control deflection to the right; I did not have adequate deflection to the left; something was blocking the control wheel from being rotated more than approximately half-way to the left. I tried several times to move the control wheel more than half-way to the left but could not. Knowing the wind at the surface was calm; and as we descended the wind-shear began to decrease; I elected to continue the landing as I believed that to be the safest course of action.

Departing from ZZZ; I was pilot monitoring and we were doing a flaps 4 departure. It was a normal takeoff with gear being put up and NAV called at 400 ft. At 1;000 RA; my FO (First Officer) announced VNAV. We climbed a couple hundred ft. and during this time; the Flight Director and AT (Autothrottle) gave us some very strange commands. The throttles should have been giving us full power. However; they had reduced back and were only giving us 50 to 65% power; and the Flight Director was telling us to go down in an attempt to speed up. We were of course at 1600 to 1700 ft. and roughly 140 kt. We received a Don't Sink" message as well. At this point; I took over the controls from my FO and overrode the AT in an attempt to feel what they were doing; and they were attempting to return to the previous lower throttle setting. I disconnected them and advanced them to full power and disregarded the Flight Director information. I proceeded through our normal flap retraction schedule.We alerted the controller to our situation and let them know that we wanted to return to the field. They had us level at 4;000 ft.; and we planned to return to ZZZ. They also asked if we would like to [request priority handling]; to which I said no. I disconnected all the automation and the Flight Director and got my bearings straight while responding [to] the controller's vectors. At some point; we decided it better to divert to ZZZ1; so we began building; bugging; and briefing for that. I contacted Dispatch and kept them in the loop; and also made a PA to the passengers and let them know as best as I could what was happening. Ultimately; in the simplest form; I would say the automation was giving us commands that we knew that we didn't want to do. When we input the landing data; we learned that we would be overweight for landing and that we needed to fly around to burn off fuel. I decided that the return was not pressing enough to do an overweight landing. My FO was having some difficultly setting up the MCDU (Multipurpose Control Display Unit) and since I couldn't help him as I was hand-flying; I turned the automation back on to see if it would work. It appeared to work; and satisfied with that; I began helping with the setup of the approach. To give myself more latitude and leeway; I decided it would be best to [request priority handling] for a "just in case" scenario. Dispatch then informed us that emergency vehicles would be meeting us at the plane; to which I said that would not be necessary. I asked the controller about this and they said it was standard [priority handling] protocol. The reason I didn't want the vehicles was because I didn't want to panic the passengers. I called the flight attendants at some point and asked how they were doing; informed them that no brace would be necessary; and that it would be a normal landing.Just to cover all bases here I did consider the possibility of trying to replicate the malfunction by doing some maneuvers; but ultimately decided against it as my primary concern was the wellbeing of the passengers. We burned off the necessary fuel and came in for a normal landing. The emergency vehicles did a once over; and then we proceeded to the gate. This report is being filed for a just in case scenario. I really do think that I maneuvered through this situation in a very good manner; in that I followed what I've been trained to do via not being overly reliant on the automation and overriding it when necessary; as well as keeping everyone in the loop who needed to know. I attest my performance to the excellent training that I received over the years. While I can't think of any really specific; as I've indicated to anyone that's called me so far; I'm very willing to hear any suggestions that can help me navigate through future events; small and large."

During approach; upon gear extension; we received WHEEL N/W STRG FAULT. We coordinated with Tower for go-around instructions and went around. After performing the go-around and switching to departure we conducted the non-normal per SOP and entered a hold over ZZZZZ. We advised departure of our nose wheel steering fault and coordinated with them to have a tug relocate to the runway. ATC requested priority handling on our behalf and crash and fire rescue also met us after landing. We sent an ACARS to Dispatch; made multiple PAs for the passengers and advised inflight. ATC vectored us back in line for a second approach. We advised the Tower once again of our issue and; after landing; we cleared on FR and stopped clear of Runway XXL. Crash and fire rescue evaluated the aircraft and found no issues. Once the tug was hooked up we were towed to gate. After block in we entered the discrepancy into the logbook and called Dispatch to clarify the event with them.

I was CA and PF on the next-to-last leg of a four day sequence. ZZZ is a Special Qualification Airport; due to mountainous terrain and complex procedures; requiring pilot review of the company ops advisory pages and Jeppesen color qualification pages in Jeppesen FD-Pro prior to operations there. The FO/PM had flown into this airport numerous times at a previous carrier prior to joining our company; so is very familiar with the local terrain and procedures. This was my first time flying there; however.Enroute to ZZZ; I reviewed the ops advisory pages and the color qualification pages; and we discussed the ILS Rwy XX approach planned based upon the prevailing winds at the time; along with the company engine failure missed approach procedures for that runway. Once in radio range of ZZZ; the FO/PM obtained the ATIS; which reflected a new weather observation that included a wind shift and runway change to runway YY. I then adjusted the FMS to reflect the ILS Rwy YY approach and we discussed the new approach. The FO warned me that their previous carrier had had a terrain warning event on this approach; where pilots that were cleared for the approach had immediately set the FAF altitude at ZZZZZ [Intersection] of 3;800 MSL and begun a descent to that altitude prior to capturing the glide slope; failing to honor the stepdown altitudes of 5500 ft. at ZZZZZ1 [Intersection] and 4800 ft. at ZZZZZ2 [Intersection]. As a result; this approach became a regular focus during their recurrent simulator training. I noted that the approach does not allow autopilot coupled approaches; a constraint I have not seen before; and said that I would hand fly the approach and use manual thrust for proficiency which I try to do at least once on every sequence. The FO/PM suggested we could fly the GPS approach that allows coupled approaches; but I did not consider that to be necessary. In hindsight; that would have been a better choice than the ILS.I failed to recognize the threat the FO was warning me of; which is especially salient in the Airbus; that once the localizer is captured the aircraft will NOT honor FMS (NAV) altitude constraints. My plan was to not arm approach until inside of ZZZZZ2 [Intersection]; and instead use a managed descent; allowing the FMS to ensure the ZZZZZ1 [Intersection] and ZZZZZ2 [Intersection] constraints were met. I then failed to properly monitor the aircraft to ensure it did what I intended.  Once we were cleared to intercept the localizer and it captured; I set the ZZZZZ [Intersection] FAF altitude of 3800 ft.; and managed the descent; while we were still outside of ZZZZZ1 [Intersection]. I had forgotten that; once in localizer track mode; NAV altitude constraints will not be honored. The aircraft was slow and smooth to start the managed descent; and I didn't recognize that it had started descending. The FO/PM did; however; and warned me. As I recall; I then mentioned my intent to have the FMS control the descents to avoid being below the ZZZZZ1 [Intersection] and ZZZZZ [Intersection] fix altitudes in case the glide slope did not honor them. The glide slope feather does not extend beyond the FAF on this approach; indicating it is not certified beyond the FAF. The FO immediately pressed ALT HOLD and pointed out we were below the required altitude at ZZZZZ1 [Intersection]. Reviewing the incident; we passed ZZZZZ1 [Intersection] at 5325 ft.; 175 ft. below the minimum of 5500 ft. We passed abeam the highest peak on the approach plate and very close to the final approach course at 5125 ft. (minimum altitude at that point was 4800 ft.). As I recall; I then armed the approach mode and we captured the glideslope; passing the next fix of ZZZZZ2 [Intersection] at 4875 ft. (minimum altitude of 4800 ft.). I then turned off the autopilot per the approach requirements; and autothrust per my plan. We passed the ZZZZZ [Intersection] FAF at 3850 ft. (minimum altitude and crossing altitude of 3800) and continued to landing.Fundamentally; I failed to properly monitor the aircraft to ensure it actually flew the vertical path I intended; and intervening when it did not. Factors that led me to misconfigure the automation include several approaches commonly flown require stepdown fixes prior to the FAF. However; those approaches are normally flown in NAV; managed descent; until approaching the FAF; when approach is armed. Those set me up with an expectation bias of being able to manage the descent; forgetting that on this approach I was in LOC; not NAV. An earlier design (since reconfigured) of the ZZZ1 ILS ZZ approach was reported to have a number of pilots violated for crossing a fix outside of the FAF below the minimum altitude because they armed approach; captured the GS; and it brought the aircraft to an altitude below the minimum allowed crossing that pre-FAF fix - that made me leery of arming approach prior to the FAF.This is a challenging destination for our Airbus pilots. Include this airport as a focus in recurrent simulator training. Discuss the challenges of the mountainous terrain; coupled with a hand-flown approach; and stepdown fixes prior to the FAF yet outside the GS service volume. Add a photo from the flight deck on a clear day of the terrain ahead when over ZZZZZ1 [Intersection].

We were doing a functional check flight and while we were performing the takeoff we encountered a significant issue with the nose gear. The Captain and I elected to do a static thrust takeoff to ensure that the engine was performing normally and all systems were okay. After the Captain released the brakes (who was also the Pilot Flying) the aircraft began to accelerate; but violently started to drift right. I was in the process of setting thrust and I noticed the captain applied full left rudder to correct. The airplane continue to drift right in the Captain began aborting the takeoff and took control with the tiller. The aircraft was no faster than 40 kts. and we were able to stop on the runway and get back on center line. Once we evaluated the situation we were able to taxi off without incident. The nose wheel steering via the tiller worked correctly but we were still confused as to why the rudder steering did not work. We asked Tower if we could taxi back to the maintenance building on the runway so that we could minimize turns and had enough stopping distance if we needed to. While performing the taxi back we noticed that when applying right or left rudder the airplane turned in the opposite direction. This was only with the pedals the tiller worked in its correct direction. Once we got back to the hanger the technicians performed diagnostics and confirmed that the nose wheel steering from the pedals was indeed hooked up backwards.It was determined that the facility conducting the heavy maintenance did not connect the nose wheel steering to the rudder pedals correctlyAdd a nose wheel steering via rudder check in the functional check flight checklist.

Training aircraft in the area made a miscalculated position report and was still in the area when I approached from about 6 miles away. They didn't say anything about sticking around in that area. When I turned over to the Control Tower of the airspace I was about to enter they gave me a traffic advisory; I saw the aircraft immediately and climbed slightly; and made a slight left turn behind them. If no action was taken we would not have collided. The invasive action was just precautionary.
