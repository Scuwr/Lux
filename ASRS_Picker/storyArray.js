After run-up and instrument check; departed ZZZ2; picked up IFR pop-up clearance to ZZZ3 with 3 souls on board and 4 hours fuel. Approximately halfway to our destination; we suffered complete electrical shut down. Momentarily losing control in a dark cockpit in IMC at night; we lost our checklist and flashlight to the floor. Making available the artificial horizon on Foreflight coupled with a stratus and opening Foreflight on iPhone with the use of an Approach plate into ZZZ1; the most direct route to final was made and so was a safe landing. Once on the ground; an immediate call to ATC was made with a report of the situation. In future; I will be wearing a head-light and my checklist secure within hands reach.

Just before departure; I received one of the newer NOTAC (Dangerous Goods Form) stating we were carrying two fire extinguishers. The airbill # was XXX-XXXXXXXX. I kept one copy and returned the other to the Ops Agent. Since I hadn't seen the new forms yet; I looked in my EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) for information and looked in the Manual. I found the relevant sections detailing the new form and when it was required. During cruise; I looked over the form again and saw a note in the corner saying that a note was required to be on the Release indicating Dispatch was aware of the HAZMAT and it was entered on the Dispatch Release for tracking purposes. Since this had not been done; when we landed I called Dispatch and we conferred. He said there was nothing to be done at that point and so I am filing a report as my action.

On an IFR flight plan into ZZZ with a student under the hood flying the LOC Y Runway XX low approach only. We were on approximately a 2 mile final and at this point a Citation which we had been tracking on our ADS-B was now same altitude off our right wing. They were previously issued an instruction to follow my aircraft and be number two for Runway XX into ZZZ. The Controller in the Tower was asking for multiple position reports from four aircraft inbound to the field. The Controller then issued the Citation a right 360 instruction and rejoin final for Runway XX. This instruction turned the Citation right over the top of my aircraft and the ADS-B in was alerting traffic was 400 ft. directly above us. Following that we were given the instruction to go missed at 800 ft. MSL and 1 mile for the runway. The student executed the missed as instructed by Tower and I informed the Tower of the near midair collision from my perspective and loss of separation. Though I believe the verbiage I used on the radio of the time was 'near miss.' I was then given a phone number to call once on the ground; which I did and spoke with the Controller on duty at the time of the near midair collision. When asked why he turned that aircraft into our flight path; his response was because he didn't want to turn them over the field and they were above us. This entire event could potentially been avoided if the Tower had radar; but they don't and rely on aircraft reporting their positions.

At FL380 we received a CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING". We immediately donned oxygen masks and established crew communications. The First Officer (FO) contacted ATC and I started an emergency descent. The FO ran the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist. As we were descending; the FO stated that the cabin altitude was 9000 ft. The CABIN ALTITUDE warning light remained on for about 8-10 minutes and then extinguished. I don't know exactly at what altitude this occurred; but I believe it was in the low teens. After the FO completed the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist; requested special handling and coordinated a divert into ZZZ. We accomplished all normal checklists and an uneventful ILS XXC approach and landing. We taxied into parking without incident. CABIN ALTITUDE 2 was enunciated on the status page. My ears popped as we received the warning and I felt slightly light headed as I was donning the oxygen mask. It went away shortly thereafter. Overall; I think we did a good job. I could have included the experienced jumpseater in the resolution of the event sooner. Once he was involved; some of the load was lifted from the FO and I. The other jumpseater was a new hire and this was his first flight on the 757."

Departing [Runway] XXL ZZZ XA:35 on Date; a pair of military helicopters were passing left to right over Runway YY; below 100 ft.  We switched to tower frequency and received immediate takeoff clearance w/ traffic advisory on 6 mi final.  Not advised of military helicopters flying in formation over Runway and as we began takeoff roll we assumed they would hold short of XXL. As it became evident they would not; an abort was quickly considered; and I decided against it as we had entered the high speed regime.  We delayed rotation as we ran directly below the two military helicopters; had we rotated we would have collided.  Had the military helicopters had a midair; or descended we would have collided.  Contacted ZZZ Tower upon arrival in ZZZ1; Supervisor initiated an investigation. Received a call several hours later from supervisor requesting additional info.  Sup stated we should have been advised of military helicopters traffic; however a review of tapes indicated no advisory was made.  He further stated that evidence reviewed warranted further investigation; that he was writing a report and submitting it for review of procedures.If we were made aware of the traffic there is 0% chance we would have accepted the takeoff clearance. Suspect local controller was distracted by traffic on final.This was an unsafe operation; we should not have been given takeoff clearance; or advised of traffic so we could have not taken off.  In retrospect an immediate reject while still in low speed regime may have been the safest course of action; but we really expected them to hold short of our runway.

I was flying Aircraft X Cessna C-172N from ZZZ to ZZZ1. This was a personal flight to help maintain pilot proficiency. This is a rental aircraft from a flight school located at ZZZ. I did a full checklist-based pre-flight inspection; and normal takeoff from ZZZ. Flying my planned ZZZ1 RNAV XX approach; I proceeded to ZZZZZ; via ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ2 altitudes; and performed pre-landing checks. Had 4 white lights on the Runway XX PAPI; reduced power to lose altitude and speed. PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; I adjusted power and attitude to maintain glide slope. Checked airspeed was in the white; added first notch of flaps. Waited for aircraft to stabilize; verified PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; checked airspeed; adjusted power; added second notch of flaps. Almost immediately after second notch of flaps there was a loud bang; an immediate turn to the right; losing altitude very quickly. I corrected the uncommanded turn as much as possible; adjusted power to maintain altitude; looked for cause of problem. I noted one flap up; one down; and went around. Gained altitude; circled; and carefully explored controllability of the aircraft; 'no change' to the flaps was best for aircraft controllability. I landed without incident. In addition to the control system failure; the aircraft apparently suffered damage to the flaps. The flight school Mechanic; and the flight school; are not communicating with me; so I do not know the extent of the damage. A careful look at GPS data shows the aircraft was operated within limits; including Vfe; at all times prior to the incident. While this flight ended with a safe landing; for me this was a very close call; and caused me a few sleepless nights processing the event. I was mentally processing the event through the evening of Date1; and did not report the control system failure as quickly as I should have. It took me a while to overcome the seriousness of the event before I started my reporting responsibilities.Not having any communication or support from the flight school added additional delay. I was hoping for more information and cooperation from the school in the reporting process; as well as resolving what happened and how to avoid this situation in the future. I regret my delay and have reviewed my reporting duties and responsibilities as pilot in command to help ensure prompt reporting as required by regulations.

My student and I flew to ZZZ1 where we executed multiple successful touch and goes. We experienced very slight engine roughness during one of our takeoffs from ZZZ1 for a brief second due to my student advancing the throttle too quickly. Other than that; nothing was out of the ordinary. After a few landings we departed for one more touch and go at ZZZ.The approach into ZZZ was normal; and we had no indications of engine trouble. After touching down on Runway X; my student added full power to takeoff; forgetting to remove the flaps beforehand. Flaps were set 20 degrees; so our initial airspeed after lift off was very low (somewhere around 50 KIAS). This was the first moment I came on the controls; only to keep my student from pitching up anymore; and to keep him from removing the flaps before we were at a safe airspeed/altitude to do so. Still assisting my student with slight forward pressure on the yoke to allow airspeed to increase; I removed 10 degrees of flaps. As soon as I set the flaps from 20 to 10 degrees; the engine began running extremely rough and we experienced a partial loss of engine power. I cannot recall the exact altitude; but we were roughly 400-500 ft. AGL. So that leaves us at a very low altitude; with little to no runway left ahead of us; and a decrease in lift from reducing flaps just before the loss of power occurred.I immediately took over the flight controls. I noticed we went from a respectable climb rate to only maintaining level (at full power). I verified the fuel selector was on both; fuel mixture was full rich; and checked engine instruments. Oil pressure read slightly high; nothing catastrophic. However; the roughness sounded and felt to be getting worse; and I was not confident that we would be able to maintain altitude much longer. Due to our critically low altitude; and the uncertainty of whether or not the situation would deteriorate further in the next few moments; I made the decision to execute a precautionary landing; while the possibility of landing on a runway still existed. I informed ZZZ Tower that we were experiencing engine roughness and stated that I was turning around to land Runway XY. At the time I made that call; I did not declare an emergency because it was only engine roughness; and although it was the worst engine roughness I've ever heard; and I was fearful that the engine would give out - it hadn't yet and we were still making power. I was prepared to declare an emergency if the situation got any worse; but after the point when I began my turn there was no time to do anything except fly the airplane.I made a left turn into the wind to begin my descent for Runway XY. Losing altitude in the turn; and considering load factor/airspeed; I turned with the minimum radius possible while avoiding a stall/spin situation. The stall horn came on for a moment; and it became clear that we were not going to make the runway. I had a few moments left to consider the remaining options: land on Taxiway 1; or try to clear the GA ramp/Terminal to land in the grass beyond them. The Taxiway was the safest option; considering no other aircraft were occupying it at the time; and Runway XZ-XA is closed. I touched down on Taxiway 1; brought the airplane to a stop; and regathered my thoughts. Tower asked if our engine was still operational; to which I answered yes. I offered apologies to the ZZZ Tower for landing on Taxiway 1; because as mentioned above; I did not have enough time to declare an emergency/update them on my situation once I began the descent to land. I requested to taxi to the GA ramp and shutdown.Final words:If I could have a second chance on dealing with this scenario; I would have done everything exactly the same. As much as I wanted to fly a pattern for Runway X and do a precautionary landing with a headwind; that option did not seem to be on the table. My choices were:Enter a downwind for Runway X and hope we keep the limited performance we have to make it all the way around the pattern; orLand the plane as soon as possible before it turns into a complete power lossI chose the latter and would do it again.

Very short taxi to [Runway] 8L in Ontario so we had discussed and ran before takeoff checklist down to the line before leaving ramp. As we approached 8L I had called Tower and let them know we were ready for departure. If I remember they briefly told us to hold short awaiting IFR clearance and then it was just a couple seconds later she cleared us for takeoff on Runway 8L. The Captain was taxiing the aircraft into position as I was running the before takeoff checklist. As the airplane was just getting aligned with centerline the Captain mentioned he thought there was something on the runway. I was actually looking towards the far end of the runway to see if I could see any type of strobes or lighting as it was night time. It was once we had all the aircraft lights on that we could clearly see a van parked broadsided right on the middle of the runway about 1;000 feet in front of us or so. I had not yet called before takeoff checklist complete or verbally mentioned Runway 8L verified before the Captain had noticed something on the runway. No takeoff power was added or anything like that. I called the Tower to let them know there was a vehicle on the runway and the controller seemed very surprised. The controller cancelled our takeoff clearance and gave us a clearance to line up and wait. Controller then began communicating with FAA ground vehicles to try and get a hold of whomever was on the runway. Controller was unable to contact vehicle on the runway but was able to get a nearby airborne helicopter to hover over the vehicle and use a spotlight and or loud speaker to alert the personnel on the ground. We saw the ground personnel then run over to the vehicle; hop in; and drive off. The tower controller then had another FAA vehicle do a runway inspection the length of the runway and verify that everything was clear of the runway. Once the runway was verified to be clear we were once again cleared for takeoff. We ran the before takeoff checklist below the line again as it had been several minutes since our initial takeoff clearance. We departed ONT without further incident. The controller was very apologetic about the issue. Not sure exactly what happened or where the breakdown was that allowed the vehicle onto the runway without the controller's knowledge. It would have been very very difficult for controller to see the vehicle on the runway from the tower.Some type of breakdown in communication between FAA Ops vehicle/operator and Control Tower. The controller mentioned to us that the vehicle had not been authorized to be on the runway. I believe the operator had been out on the runway changing lights possibly? I do know the vehicle was running though and there was not anybody in the vehicle. Not exactly sure how/why vehicle had gotten out onto the active runway without authorization. Better communication/procedures between Ground Ops/Tower. I also think that if you're going to have vehicles like that on the runway; especially at night; they should be required to have some sort of strobe or beacon light. The vehicle was honestly very hard to see before all of our aircraft lights were on. If the vehicle had been further down the runway; I'm not sure we would have noticed it before we began the takeoff roll.

After takeoff from Runway XXR at ZZZ; First Officer was flying; he noticed his electric trim was not working. We continued to climb and retract the flaps; to get some altitude to troubleshoot while manually trimming the aircraft. My electric trim refused to work as well. I pulled the checklist for Stab Trim Fail to start working the problem while [the First Officer] controlled the aircraft; and we elected to stop climbing at FL 190. We elected to return to ZZZ; and ATC gave us vectors to return and descend. I alerted Dispatch that we were returning; told the Flight Attendants; and made an announcement over the PA to the Passengers. First Officer continued to fly the aircraft with me assisting with the manual trim; while I got the performance numbers loaded and worked the radios. I briefed the approach to Runway XXR; then took over flying for the final approach and landing. After landing we ran the brake cooling [checklist]; and it indicated that we were good to taxi to the gate.

On our go around from [Runway] 19R in Las Vegas we encountered a RA from a departing air carrier. My FO (First Officer) failed to respond in a correct and timely manner so I took control of the aircraft and complied with RA. When I looked outside the window and saw how close the other aircraft was I turned as well to the rear of the plane. I think that the FO did not comply with the RA. Also Tower couldn't give us instructions fast enough to avoid the conflict. Better training.

During cruise; about an hour after departure; both FMC computers stopped working for about 25 seconds (roughly). The FMC option disappeared from both CDU MENU screens. Both moving maps stopped; all performance data was removed and the autopilot defaulted to CWS roll (as anticipated) when the navigation data became unavailable. We began the process of verify raw data navigation when both FMC computers came back online and proceeded to operate normally. Operationally; we called Operations Control and Maintenance Control and concurred that we were safe to continue. Basic navigation was unaffected and so the safety of flight was not reduced in the event it happened again. However; it does seem to qualify as a serious impact on aircraft systems -- especially since the design redundancy did not work (both sides failed simultaneously). Because the system reset itself normally and did not repeat the fault; it qualified as an INFO-ITEM and the AML entry was made in ZZZ; but the event also appears to qualify as a mandatory report. The description is the same verbiage used in the report. There were no additional factors that indicated the reason that both FMC computers would simultaneous shutdown and then simultaneously restart. No turbulence; we were not interacting with either CDU at the time; nothing. The event is very strange since it caused a breakdown in the 'design through redundancy' principle.Simultaneous failure of redundant systems is a bigger problem than 'an anomaly'. We happened to be in cruise within VOR and VHF range. If this had happened at a more critical time of flight-- where time critical usage of the FMC is greater-- this would have been a larger problem. If this had happened when we were beyond VOR/VHF range; this would have also caused a more serious impact on flight safety. When the FMC computers went offline; we had no access to GPS or IRS navigation data. We also lost all access to FMC performance data. Finding the cause and correcting it appears to be a high priority.

Early in the boarding process; the B-Flight Attendant came forward a let me know there was a passenger who was cleaning a row of seats with an aerosol spray cleaner. In addition the passenger was verbally difficult when the matter was brought up with her. The Flight Attendant asked for a Customer Service Supervisor. I was able to locate one and requested that she speak with the B-Flight Attendant and the customer to ensure there was not going to be any issues airborne. I was not specific with her about the spray cleaner as I was more concerned that there would be a personality conflict. In addition; throughout this time I was managing two new MELs with Dispatch and Maintenance. Upon completion of that effort; I understood that the issues in back were resolved and we proceeded without incident. Later in the day I asked how the flight had gone with the passenger in question and while they handled the personality clash; no problem we reflected back upon the aerosol issue. It seemed the cleaner was still on the aircraft. I reviewed the FOM and the First Officer reviewed the Company manual. It appeared from that review that the item could have been considered a HAZMAT item that may have been required to be in the checked baggage; vice carry on. What was also noted was [that] there is the HAZMAT Hotline that would have been able to make the proper assessment of the item.

Practicing power off 180's with Instructor at ZZZ. I did a GUMPS shock midfield; but failed to extend the gear. Once power was set to idle the gear unsafe horn came on; after doing various other power off maneuvers at altitude; my brain ignored the warning horn and I became hyper focused on speed and my landing point. Flew the approach and upon entering into ground effect I noticed something was wrong as the wheels should be touching. I looked down and the horn came back into focus and I caught the error. Immediately added power to initiate a go-around and upon doing so the prop stuck the runway. I was midfield and committed to the go-around at that point and began the climb. I was shaken up so I handed the controls over to my Instructor. The airplane did not indicate any adverse effects; no vibrations and the climb was normal.I have a lot of time in the Arrow and always go a GUMPS check once on downwind and a secondary gear check on final; my failure to comply with my own personal procedure led to this happening. Also I noticed a better glide and that should have been another indication that something was wrong.For the future; I will be sure to continue utilizing a GUMPS check and secondary gear checks as well as adding a third while crossing the threshold and not tuning the gear unsafe horn out. Also I need to be more mindful of becoming hyper complacent in airplanes that I am comfortable with; as well as being impulsive during times of high workloads. For a future abnormal procedure where a landing is aborted in a high stress environment; I need to focus on flying the airplane. I was able to focus to initiate the go around and the climb; but I felt the need to transfer controls after I began to think about what just happened rather than flying the airplane. Lastly; and most importantly I need to be mindful of becoming hyper focused on a few items and be more Thorough with checklist items and keep a good scan going throughout every maneuver.Airplane is grounded and has been reported.

Aircraft had MEL 34-XX-X and MEL 34-XX-Y. ATL was conducting ILS Runway 26R. I was flying had nav1 signal for LOC 1 with IGXZ on PDF. The LOC became intermittent working and red flag in VMC conditions. Corrected each time but was vectored around for another approach. During this apprise the FO (First Officer) NAV 2 LOC was working. Briefed the changes due to FO will be flying now. When cleared for approach the Flight Director failed and came back. Still VMC and then the FO nav 2 loc 2 went red with red loc flag; which went back to green. Told ATC again there was a problem. Low on fuel we diverted to ZZZ. Discussed with Dispatch. Landed with 1;600 lbs. ATL Approach was very helpful and understanding. Loss of reliability with navigation NAV 1 and NAV 2.

I was on my break. The purser woke me up and told me that I was needed in the cockpit. I saw that we had offset 5 miles right of course and I was told of the problem. The L ENG OH checklist had been accomplished. When the left throttle was reduced to idle; the L ENG OH message went away. We were between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 on the D track to ZZZ Airport. We [requested priority handling] and received clearance to descend to FL310 and then turn left and proceed directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We made a radio call on XXX.XX stating our position and our planned descent. The L ENG OH checklist came on again on the EICAS. We did the checklist again and this time; when the throttle was reduced to idle; the message did not disappear. We continued the checklist and shut down the left engine. We got clearance to FL200 and we flew directly to ZZZ1 Airport. We communicated with Dispatch; ZZZ Radio; the Flight Attendant's (FA) and made a PA to the passengers. We were given priority vectors to Runway XXR and landed uneventfully.  We taxied clear of the runway and had the Fire Chief look over the plane concentrating on the left engine. We then taxied to Gate XX and shut down.Cause: The L ENG Fire Loop has apparently been replaced 3 sequences prior to our flight. My guess is that it was not completed properly.Suggestions: I don't know how it could have been prevented; but I will say that the training we receive at recurrent is excellent. We performed very well as a team. We discussed things together before executing anything.

During descent in VMC; the Captain PF (Pilot Flying) asked me; FO (First Officer) PM (Plot Monitoring); to request a VMC descent from Denver Center. Our clearance at the time was to cross the Dunoir DNW VOR at 14;000 ft. I requested the VMC descent from Center. Center asked if we were requesting a Visual Approach and I believe I said yes and they may have said to expect that. Our understanding was that we were cleared to descend VMC. The Captain then began a VMC descent prior to reaching DNW. At approximately 12;700 ft. ATC issued a low altitude alert and told us to climb to 14;000 ft. We told them we were descending VMC to the airport. They asked if we wanted to cancel IFR to which we replied yes. They then said 'IFR cancellation received; squawk VFR; frequency change approved'. We then contacted the JAC Tower; conducted a Visual Approach and landing to Runway 19 with no issues.
