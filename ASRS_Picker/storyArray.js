I landed at ZZZ with my students after the first half of a dual paired flight. I was very excited by the progress of my student and was talking with them both as I went to park on the T nearest the FBO. I swung in too close to a black light post and my wing cleared or barely didn't clear the post. My student says he saw it hit. I inspected the post with a ZZZ employee and we found no damage and we all looked at the wing and saw no damage. I went inside and immediately called Name to inform him about what happened. He left it in my judgement to continue to fly. I carefully reinspected the wing; aileron paddle and could find no damage or scratches. We continued the flight without incident.Set a better example of sterile cockpit on taxi and park first before trying to share my excitement with my student.

I departed ZZZ1 enroute to ZZZ in Cessna Centurion T210 IFR with no passengers. On arrival I requested radar vectors to the RNAV (GPS) Runway XX approach. While I was being vectored; I noted a complete loss of radio communication with Approach Control. I did not hear a vector to the final approach course and no clearance for the approach.  The failure was intermittent and I could hear a word or two intermittently. Multiple attempts at restoring communication were not successful. I re-positioned the aircraft back towards the airport and managed to establish some communication with a Controller intermittently. He vectored me around some traffic and then cleared me for a visual approach to Runway XX.  Unfortunately; the communication difficulties distracted me and I failed to lower the landing gear. No gear warning horn sounded. I had the gear warning horn worked on about ten days prior to this flight. A gear up landing was made with no injuries.Partial radio failure intermittent [was] due to poor connection of headset. No FARs violated. Distraction and failure of gear warning horn resulted in gear up landing.

GSP ATCT advised ZTL that they would be closing at XA:30 local for a COVID cleaning at that ZTL would be assuming the airspace. There was debate about which sector/sectors would assume the airspace based on the contingency plan but eventually it was decided that it would be divided up as is usually done on the midnight shift. When GSP ATCTC closed; The ARTS entry was not made to ensure that hand offs could be properly forwarded to the correct sectors and a through briefing of which VFR towers were still open was not given leaving areas of confusion about who were and were not open after the airspace was assumed. The automation issue of the ARTS entry caused each hand off to be verbally coordinated within the airspace as well as manually tracking up each hand off leading to increased and unneeded complexity and coordination. Staffing was also an issue as 2 CPC's and the only Supervisor on duty in the area were given annual leave during the shift leaving the area short when the GSP closure took place and a CIC was left to work the unusual situation. This resulted in the 3 sectors being combined with multiple frequencies as well as high complexity from working CLT inbounds and departures in addition to the GSP inbounds and departures at the same time. We are not an approach control and cannot provide the level of efficiency or safety of an approach control during the hours when the approach control is suppose to be open. We are limited by the rules we must adhere to and cannot provide the level of service that the users are accustomed to during this time of day. This was not a COVID emergency or an evacuation. The cleaning should have been conducted after the normal closing hours of GSP ATCT to minimize impact on the operation of ZTL as well as the users. There is no reason why this could not have been done after midnight when GSP ATCT is normally closed. If it was based on the cost of not holding someone at GSP over for an overtime shift; then safety was put behind cost by the agency; and the ATM of GSP ATCT should have volunteered to personally stay him or herself. There were a few unsafe situations and unneeded stress on ZTL brought on by this closure and cleaning that could have been delayed by a few hours. The supervisor on duty should also not have been allowed to leave early given the unusual and complex nature of the situation.

I was working with Avionics Tech Name; we accomplished both Task Cards. XX-XXXX-X-XXXX and XX-XXXX-XXXY. This was a quick turn back to terminal. I signed off both job cards on my IPAD and realized that I made the mistake of signing for both EEC (Electronic Engine Control) 1 and 2 existing fault checks that were ETOPS issued work. I should have Read and understand task card.

On taxi out; there was a split in N1 on FMC. Tried to reset pack and bleed. N1 matched but then would split again. Decided to takeoff and check in the air. We took off Runway XXR. N1 was slightly split on takeoff. Climbed out and noticed right pack producing 10 PSI. Pressurization was a bit erratic but pressurizing. Decided to contact Dispatch and M/C. Explained situation and M/C said we could continue. I asked about maintenance in ZZZ1 and if the problem could be deferred. M/C said if Duct pressure was less than 20 psi in cruise then it would be non dispatchable. We leveled at FL310 and the right duct pressure was still 10 psi. I thought it would not make sense to continue and have the aircraft grounded in ZZZ1. DISCUSSED WITH DISPATCH AND BEST course of action was to return to ZZZ2. NORMAL LANDING and taxi to gate. I wish I had not taken off and contacted M/C to discuss the split N1. I was a little rushed and knew a delay could possibly result in legality problems coming home.

After departure from ZZZ; our landing gear was showing the mains up and locked with the nose wheel still unlocked. We were briefed to recycle the gear to fix the issue. Upon recycling the gear; the nose was still showing unlocked. Now; the mains were locked and the nose was unlocked. The gear handle was now stuck in the down position with a weight on wheels miscompare message showing on the CAS. We ran the appropriate checklist and tried pulling the D ring handle to get the nose unlocked. This did not work. We did a low pass to verify the indication and the Ops crew verified our nose wheel was still up. We asked to fly around for a bit to make calls to our company. After exhausting our options to get the nose down; we maneuvered aggressively to try to get it down. We were eventually able to get it down and land safely. All messages on the CAS cleared. Priority was given to us to maneuver around the ZZZ1 area. Approach; Tower; Ground and Ops did everything they could to help us. The crew in the plane used CRM to reach out to outside sources for help. The aircraft manufacturer maintenance was communicating with us to help with ideas. In the end; it turned out well. Crew; passengers and plane were safe.

Approximately around XA:20z climbing though FL380 for FL400; we got a level two alert for Tail Fuel Pumps LO. At this time the PF was told to continue flying and the PIC  and Relief Pilot;  will conduct the Quick Reference Hand book; abnormal procedures fuel 'Tail Pumps Lo' procedure. We conducted the procedure getting to the turn on tail tank alt pump switch 'on'; it was only green for about 30 seconds and went amber. There was 1;450 kilograms of fuel in tail tank and we had another alert 'Alt Tail Pump Lo'. At this point the aircraft is leveling off at FL400. The fuel flow looked normal for all three engines but when the power was moving back for cruse setting the number 2 engine just continued to roll back to flight ideal with 0 fuel flow. At this point the PIC asked ATC for FL340 to work of fuel issue. The procedure was completed by this point and the PIC asked crew if they would like to attempt a restart or just return to ZZZZ. PIC agreed with crew to return due to the close distance to ZZZZ and the ability to have any services need at this location. The PIC asked for the Engine shutdown in flight Procedure. Once completed the PIC loaded the ZZZZ ILS XXL approach in the flight computer. The PF briefed the approach and the aircraft landed with no further issues.

As I entered left downwind for Runway XX [at] ZZZ I saw an aircraft departing Runway XX. I heard a mumbled radio call and was able to make out 'departure'. The aircraft turned left and I heard another mumbled call and was able to make out 'crosswind'. I then saw the aircraft heading toward me and it seemed to be gaining on me rapidly.I had made a call 2 miles NE of the [landmark] followed by another call directly over the [landmark]. I also called downwind. All my calls included 'aeronca' so other aircraft could appreciate that I would be slower. When I realized the other aircraft may not have me in sight I made 2 more calls trying to get them to LOOK. As they closed on me I made an aggressive climb above traffic pattern altitude. They passed directly under me - from my 7 o'clock to my 2 o'clock; about 100 ft. vertical.This was a flight school aircraft. This flight school caters to foreign students and apparently they really do not understand English. They seem to know the calls they need to make for the pattern but do not seem to comprehend what is going on around them. Looking at their flight aware tracking - they never reduced power to fly the pattern. I went into the flight school to speak with the chief CFI but no one was available. As I spoke with the front desk personnel; some of the foreign students overheard and started talking in their foreign language. I have heard them use non English on CTAF. I really think the school needs to strongly prohibit the use of any non English anytime they are on the property or in an airplane. Their radio transmissions are often very difficult to understand. They also need to teach about reducing power while in the pattern. When an aircraft has a slower and constant speed; it is easier to spot other traffic. My aircraft is a legacy aircraft without [an] engine driven electrical system and is exempt from ADS-B requirements. I wonder if they were looking at Fore Flight or some other display to see traffic instead of looking out the window.

As we were switched over to Bogota FIR; it was very hard to understand the Controller because there was a high pitched squeal on the radio. I felt like my SA (Situational Awareness) started to go down at this point because I was focusing on trying to understand the Controller. I misunderstood multiple clearances and had to ask twice for the clearance. We were given the RNAV RNP X 31L. The Captain and I had briefed and gone over the points on both the STAR and approach multiple times each. We were finally headed to AMVES when we were cleared direct to BO710. We briefed [that] we were going to do our LAVS 1 nm prior to this point. 1 nm mile prior the Captain rolled in 8400 feet in the MCP alt window. For some reason we were stuck in VNAV ALT. She selected 500 fpm down on the VS to get us going down and quickly selected VNAV again. We were high on the path and realized we were past the final approach point about the same time we got a terrain caution. The Captain called for a go around at this point. I think there were many contributing factors that led to this event. First of all I have less than 75 hours in the airplane as well as having never been to Bogota before. My SA started going down when we started to have communication issues [with] Bogota center. I had trouble understanding clearances which contributed to my task saturation. We briefed and checked points multiple times on the first approach going into [Runway] 31 as well as the LAVS procedure. I think since we had such a high ground speed between high altitude and tail wind that may have caused us to be high on the path before we had a chance to get on it. Taking the clearance direct to BO710 as opposed to taking direct AMVES did us no favors. I was task saturated and unfortunately was not as good of a backup as I should have been.

I approached runway XX at ZZZ for landing in a Cessna 172. The landing appeared normal after the wheels touched the ground; the plane; however; was about 4 ft to the left of the center line. I slowly pressed the right rudder pedal to direct the plane to the center line. After seeing the plane turn right; I slowly used the left rudder pedal to gently offset the turn to the right but the plane did not respond. It continued turning to the right for nearly two seconds longer than I wanted it to; by the time I regained my left rudder usage; the plane was already near the edge of the runway on its way to a grassy area between taxiway Lima and taxiway Hotel. I did not want to over-correct to the left since I was concerned the plane would flip over. I managed to stop the plane at Alpha in front of the FBO. The plane did not collide with any person or thing. ZZZ ATC asked if I needed any assistance; I was unharmed so I declined the offer.I parked the plane and inspected the exterior. The only damage I noticed was to the 'tail skid;' the aftermarket metal attachment designed to protect the tail of the plane in the event of a tail strike.  It was bent and turned toward the right front of the plane near the right rudder. I noticed scuff marks on the rudder's right side (pilot's right); the full movement of the right rudder was inhibited by the twisted Tail Skid. I proceeded into the ZZZ FBO to call my flight instructor. He informed me that he would call me back in 20 minutes after conferring with the management at the flight school. While I was waiting; I requested a mechanic at the FBO to look at the plane.During this time; I was approached by a gentleman; he identified himself as part of flight operations at ZZZ. He asked for my personal information; I provided all that he requested.I was told by the mechanic that the plane could not fly until the damaged Tail Skid was removed.  He said the rest of the plane appears unaffected and because this is an aftermarket and unnecessary part for the plane; it was safe to fly again.Upon reflection; it is likely that I over-flared the landing incurring a tail strike and damaging the Tail Skid. The Tail Skid twisted and turned toward the right side which ultimately locked the right rudder very briefly into place during the landing roll on the runway.

On climbout of ZZZ smelled a food burning smell. I thought Flight Attendant (FA) was cooking our crew meals. Got a call from FA later during climb that smell was strong throughout cabin. First Officer (FO) then said he saw a bird go by on climbout that he thought we may have hit. After discussing issue with Operations and Maintenance control via crew phone; I decided to return to ZZZ and land overweight per their suggestion and the fact that we had the fume event happening. [Priority handling was requested] for overweight landing and bird strike on takeoff. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was called out and they followed us to gate inspecting the engine for damage and to ensure no fire ignited. Passengers were deplaned. Got a new plane and departed for ZZZ1 again 4 hours late. Bird strike was in number #1 engine as evidenced by blood and feather debris noted by us and maintenance on post flight walk around. This was written up in Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML). Overweight landing was written up in AML with required parameters also. Another AML write up was done for item not related to this event as well.No suggestions.

Departing APV Runway 18; I left traffic pattern westward in the upwind following Aircraft Y also departing. Immediate west departure was for safety as additional aircraft were attempting left downwind entry of 18 at APV. Nearly immediately after turning west; I received a terrain advisory on a garment 430 NAV. The warning would not clear and I continued to follow departing traffic as I was clear of terrain but between two hills southwest of APV. For safety; I continued to focus on climbing to altitude and departing traffic rather than continue to clear the warning from the 430.I noticed I was in VCV airspace when followed departing traffic began to descend and I looked down to see an aviation boneyard. I immediately turned east to vacate the airspace and began to clear terrain message to obtain VCV Tower frequency. Although; VCV's airspace was not 'busy'; my concern is that the persistent terrain message can make it difficult for pilots to identify Class D airspace and be problematic if airspace is more congested.

At around XA:30 local; I was holding short of [runway]. Given a clearance to lineup and wait. As student pilot taxied onto [runway]; I did a final look over of aircraft. I noticed a fuel leak off the right wing and a large wet spot where we were holding short. I hadn't noticed this prior to this point. At that point; I took controls and asked Tower for taxi clearance back to the ramp. I was given a canceled T/O clearance; taxi ahead to [taxiway] 1 and hold short of 2. Switched to Ground and was asked if I needed assistance. I stated no; just taxi back to ramp for a small fuel drip. Told not to taxi with a fuel leak and to shut down. Eventually; an airport authority truck came by to inspect; told ATC it was minimal; and I was given clearance to start up and taxi back. Several vehicles were deployed and many aircraft were rerouted as [taxiways] were shutdown. On a separate note; I forgot to switch on all lights when crossing [runway] on the way back in. I did complete a visual check and check on map. Made it a teaching moment for student. Always remember to stay focused and calm during tense situations so that nothing small is missed. Not sure what could have been done to prevent fuel issue. With regards to forgetting to turn on lights during runway crossing; always remain calm during tense situations.

After having flow from ZZZ1 to ZZZ for a quick turn; we kept the APU running and aircraft cool and comfortable without any issues. Upon pushing back; we received a ground stop notice for ZZZ1 and conferred with Dispatch to continue. After starting #1 engine; Ground Control held us on the ramp for approximately 15 minutes. We had the APU bleed on as well as both packs on (standard southeast taxi configuration). No issues at that time. Upon taxi out clearance; a heavy rain started and with just a small application of power to engine #1 to start the taxi we noticed a faint dirty socks smell as we joined the taxiway out. At that same moment Ground Control notified us that the ground stop was lifted and we started the 2nd engine start sequence. During that time the smell got worse and we were notified by the Flight Attendants of the smell. After shutting down the APU there was absolutely no change and the odor continued to get stronger. We tried to isolate the packs individually to no avail. At that time we told Ground we needed to return to the gate and coordinated with Dispatch and Operations. On the taxi back; the Flight Attendants said the smell was super strong in the aft part of the aircraft and that the aft Flight Attendant was feeling nauseous. I immediately shutdown both packs which started an improvement. The aft Flight Attendant requested to have medical attention at the gate and we arranged for it. Ramp was shut down due to lighting; but Company was able to get us in via a marshaling vehicle. Once at the gate; the aft Flight Attendant got medical attention while we unloaded without any passenger issues. Afterwards; all the Flight Attendants sought to be checked out by a medical facility.Purely a mechanical issue that occasionally plagues the airbus. No improper action lead to this issue. Airbus has had these issues for far too long to not have found a permanent fix or redesign. At what point will health concerns outweigh cost?

Departure deviation following heavy Widebody after takeoff.[Runway] 8R cleared for takeoff behind heavy Widebody aircraft.Weather conditions after takeoff; night VFR winds out of southeast 45 knots at 1400 ft. MSL.From rotation to about 4;500 ft. in and out of wake turbulence from preceding heavy Wide body aircraft. Just climbing through 1;000 feet FO (First Officer) stated 'we've dumped our departure route' out of the box/FMC.  [We responded by] putting in JAMBA; first waypoint on SID; back in box and then KBOLA for now. We began our turn direct JAMBA.MIA Departure Control; very busy; asked 'are you proceeding direct JAMBA?'FO responded; 'yes we are now proceeding direct JAMBA; we've been deviating a little to get out of wake turbulence from heavy aircraft we are following.'Departure Control cleared us continue climb 7;000 ft. speed restriction 250 kts.Just before reaching JAMBA Departure Control cleared us direct to KBOLA.4 NM before KBOLA Departure Control gave us a heading and 250 speed restriction still in effect; after which the remainder of the flight continued uneventfully.[We discussed; as a crew;] how and when we; the FO and me; dumped the SID out of the FMC. At the gate; before push back; with due diligence downloaded our route; departure Runway 8R; SID-KMIA FOLZZ1 FOLZZ; and ATC route clearance amendments FOLZZ DIR ZFP DIR BAAGR DIR GRATX then as filed; manually into the FMC. We then reviewed route and points individually as per normal procedures; all good. On the ATC clearance uplink the amended points came up as FOLZZ-N2617.3W07920.9; ZFP-N2633.3W07841.8; BAAGR-N2649.0W07631.3. When input manually to the FMC for example ZFP you get two choices of Lat Long's to choose from; so you pick the one with the corresponding Lat Long's....etc.                                                                 However; it was noted later at the gate that we could have just auto uploaded the ATC amended part of the clearance through the FMC ATC clearance LOAD button which would have put in the ZFP and BAAGR points with the correct Lat Long's less chance of error....'See-Check it out!' I obviously must have pushed that button. No excuse; as I've read many reports from other professional pilots-colleagues on our team sharing similar events. I respect and thank them for sharing so I wouldn't make this mistake. Some of our pilots; new to aircraft and/or don't fly much; great to review things but; there is the right time and place. My timing was bad to review any FMC operations. I should have checked to see; after my FMC review with the FO; that I hadn't messed up our original route data.

Captain (CA) was Pilot Flying (PF). We flew ZZZ1 XX with no issue and landed. Taxied off XX onto Runway YY. Ground told us to take Kilo and hold short abeam gate 33. After I read this back I began my after landing flow. I noticed the L BTMS [Brake Temperature Monitor system] Indicator on the most left wheel began to skyrocket. It went from 2 to 15 to 20 and then red. It gave us Master Warning Brake Overheat. ATC cleared us to taxi to the gate; but we told them we need to stay put and run a checklist. I ran Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) then Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). The Captain directed me to call ATC and ask for the fire trucks to take a look at the brakes; as we had no other abnormal indications (the BTMS directly next to it was reading only 02 and green). An airline taxiing by told us they did not see any smoke or fire; and the fire trucks relayed the same information when they arrived. They also took the temperature of the brakes. We elected to continue to the gate. Maintenance deferred the indicator.

The aircraft had the flaps operating only in the flaps primary mode. When the flaps were being operated from 0 to 5 or 5 to up they were operating in the primary mode; and they take forever to retract and at heavy weight; like our takeoff there is a very narrow speed envelope of 10 kts. So we had a heavy takeoff from Runway XX with thunderstorms around the airport and near our SID. Shortly after takeoff while retracting flaps from 1 to up and starting a climbing turn we experienced a windshear of 20 kts loss and momentary stick shaker. I immediately commanded I have control and commanded level attitude and bank and regained airspeed. Afterwards flight proceeded normally. After landing in ZZZ1 spoke to mechanics that flaps as they were; presently; were taking too long to retract in primary mode versus normal operation and did not feel comfortable in this situation especially at heavy weights.

After clearing the Runway 36L at AUS on Taxiway G; Ground Control issued us taxi instructions:  'G; C; West Ramp on C.  The First Officer then went off frequency to call Operations. Just before reaching taxiway C; I looked to my left in the direction of the upcoming turn and saw a Aircraft Y; moving southbound on C at about 30-40 knots. I had to slam on my brakes in order to avoid a collision. I then made a snarky remark to the Ground Controller that a head's up about Aircraft Y jet would have been appreciated. He apologized and said something to us to indicate that he had been distracted by ramp traffic and airplanes waiting to get to gates. This could have been a catastrophic collision had I not been glancing to my left.  Recommend a dedicated ramp controller that deals with ramp traffic thereby allowing the Ground Controller to monitor and control the movement area.Ground Control distracted with ramp congestion and never told us about other aircraft.Suggest a dedicated Ramp Control frequency and Controller.

On approach into ZZZ around 5;000 feet MSL; we began selecting flaps. The flaps began to extend but froze at about 0.5 degrees extension.We told ZZZ Approach that we needed to cancel the approach. ZZZ Approach vectored us north on downwind so we could run the appropriate QRH.We determined the correct QRH in this situation to be: Trailing Edge Flap Disagree - The trailing edge flaps are not in the commanded (flap handle) position. There was no asymmetry. We completed the QRH; landed; and taxied to the gate uneventfully.We are awaiting the cause for the flap extension failure from the maintenance investigation. Practicing flap malfunctions in CQ (Continuing Qualification) definitely helped with the flap failure on this flight. Also it's been great practicing early missed approaches in CQ the past 2 years as I got to apply that training on this flight!

While I was Pilot Monitoring (PM) during our stabilized approach to XXL at ZZZ; we encountered strong crosswinds within demonstrated limits.  The First Officer was Pilot Flying (PF) and reported at least 930 hours in type and at the operation.  After autopilot disconnection at approximately 300 ft. Above Ground Level (AGL); the PF started to enter into a pilot induced oscillation (PIO) with their airspeed; but was within stabilized approach criteria.  I called for a speed correction which in turn required other flight control changes given the pitch power relationship.  We touched down on centerline; but the PF did not initially introduce enough aileron correction for the crosswind.  After prompting the PF to introduce more right aileron; the airplane started to drift to the left to a point where I did not witness the PF making enough of a correction with the rudder to maintain centerline as well.  At this point; the nose landing gear had not yet touched the ground.  During this point in time; I felt a split-second decision needed to be made in the interest of safety and sternly/loudly stated 'my aircraft' and took the airplane from the FO (First Officer).  I initiated a go around and corrected the control issue with regards to the vertical axis.  We went around and advised ZZZ Tower followed by ZZZ Approach that we went around for an approach/landing that became destabilized.  I flew the aircraft back around for a landing on XXL.  We landed without incident and taxied back to the gate.  I then spent at least 10 minutes debriefing heavily with the FO as to why I took the aircraft and explained to them what had occurred and why.  The FO's attitude was positive and he held a tremendous amount of remorse for the occurrence and showed improvement throughout the remainder of the pairing.  Counsel/guidance from the on-call Chief Pilot was also sought.As a Captain I've noticed that there's been a tremendous uptick in issues similar to the instance above.  FO's have been increasingly challenged to the point that they don't seem to trust their hand flying skills.  They seem to have an over reliance on the autopilot.  During the debrief; I explained to my FO that if we would have disconnected the autopilot sooner and would have held heightened awareness for the environmental conditions present during our approach.  We also discussed in the debrief how the aircraft's weight was light.  We had already discussed this concept in flight as well and it was a review at that point in time.  I would humbly suggest that Initial course training capture increased practice/training in strong crosswind conditions with variable aircraft landing weight(s).

While at cruise at FL450; the crew heard a 'woosh' sound accompanied with a CAS msg ACM O'TEMP and EMER PRESS msgs. Checklists accomplished. I determined that; while not on the checklist; to do an immediate descent as to get to breathable atmosphere as soon as possible in case of a possible cascading failure. We were eventually cleared to 15;000 ft. We removed our masks; and told ATC we were no longer an priority aircraft and expect a normal landing. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) was not requestedSuggestions - Again; while not on the checklist; I was very concerned with a total failure of the pressurization system not to mention the heat from raw bleed air dumping into the cabin. As we were close to several suitable airports I chose to exercise my discretion under 91.3 and [request priority handling] resulting in a controlled but rapid descent. We did not descend to any altitude that we were not cleared for; and as far as I know there were no close calls with other aircraft.

While maneuvering to avoid heavy precipitation on final to Runway 32 at SRQ; the Pilot Flying (FO (First Officer)) descended below the Normal glide path on base leg. The ILS glide path guidance was erroneous. We descended to approximately 1000 ft. of base leg. Tower issued a low altitude alert. We had already leveled off and were turning to final. Also; there was a significant wind gust that cause the airspeed to gain 20 kts. FO did a nice job correcting and we were stable before reaching 500 ft.

I was asked to voluntarily submit a report with details for safety purposes; no proposed violation was involved.  I've been flying for XX+ years with YY years active and reserve instructing/evaluating in military trainers.  I'm somewhat of an expert at judging these distances and speeds.  I changed the altitude in the FMS (earlier) at ZZZZZ to a hard 10;000 MSL from a range of 10;000-11;000 MSL as is typical for me.  I was clearing both outside and inside to the PFD/ND to ensure compliance at ZZZZZ.  At ZZZZZ +/- 0.5 miles (most likely at; or after); I noticed a red and white aircraft approximately 800 ft ahead; centered vertically in the Captains windscreen and 2/3 of the way across his windscreen towards the center divider.  I was at a right 8-9 aspect angle (based on his aircraft) with an approximate 70 left heading crossing angle.  His aircraft had near zero motion in the windscreen.  In short I was flying up his 3-9 line; co-altitude with a 416 ft per second closure rate.  Slightly faster if one considers TAS.  Subtract from that closure rate the velocity they had in the same direction (near zero).  I instinctively knew I would collide if I tried to turn right; or left.  I most likely would have collided if I tried to climb over; but certainly would have sent him into an unusual attitude due to my wake/thrust turbulence.  My only choice was to click off the autopilot; rip the throttles to idle and bunt under.  I used enough force to miss the target; but with the secondary consideration of flight attendant and passenger safety.  I would estimate this was a negative 0.25 to positive 0.25 G pushover.  As I passed directly underneath; I became a little concerned that my tail might hit the aircraft.  In short I had 2 to no more than 3 seconds to identify the threat and react appropriately.  I could easily read the tail number across his fuselage; but wasn't concerned with that.  At no time was there and RA; TA; or Proximity displayed on the TCAS.  They apparently either didn't have the transponder; or have it turned on.  ATCC did not have any reading; or skin paint of their aircraft on radar; so no warning was issued.Considering the size of the other aircraft; closure rate; and being nearly motionless in the windscreen; there was little room for any improved clearing technique on my behalf.  A TCAS reading would have avoided the whole scenario.Suggest - Require transponder usage for all aircraft near Class B airspace; or their associated STARS and Departures.

Aircraft did a gate return to remove a lithium battery per OPS. Team Lead met aircraft; Main Cabin Door was not open. A power bank was given by the Captain to the Team Lead through the window and it was NOT in a Thermal Containment Bag. Team Lead placed item with other [similar items]. All items were taken down to Baggage Service Office at the end of the night. Crew filed a report but did not follow proper procedures. Customer Service Supervisor found out the next day it was smoking item after receiving email from Corporate DG. Customer Service Supervisor never saw item and pictures were not taken.

Aircraft X check on frequency at FL390 requesting FL350. I told him I have his request. I called for control. I couldn't descend to FL350 yet because of traffic at FL370 within 3-4 miles. Aircraft X said he needs to descend now so I turn him; assign him FL380; and call the ZZZ1 traffic for him. He tells me he's looking for the traffic and reads back descending to FL380. I see his data block update to FL377 and ask him about his descent. He tells me he can't maintain the altitude and is going to FL350. I turn him again but lose separation with the other traffic. I had about 4.5 miles going through the altitude of FL370. I ask what the problem is; and he says he's having a pressurization issue but that FL350 should be fine for now. But soon after requests to go lower and eventually we [gave him priority handling]. Just better communication. He said he would like to descend now but did not tell me the reason. If I knew there was an issue I could have given more urgency to vector and descend. I understand it's a possible situation and a pilot is worried about flying his aircraft first. Maybe I could have prevented the separation loss.

After parking on spot 1 and when we were in the midst of our shut down flows; the parking brake released. I had my feet on the brakes on the rudder pedals; but apparently not enough as the aircraft rolled a couple of inches. In fact; when it happened; I thought to myself; 'Good thing I have my feet on the brakes.'; and wasn't aware we had rolled at all until my First Officer asked; 'Are we rolling?' By the time she asked; the aircraft had stopped and she noticed her brakes were ineffective as my feet were still holding pressure on the brakes.

I was in flight heading back towards the airport when I smelled smoke. I called the Tower [and] received an arrival then turned off my main power and checked all of my breakers and fuses. No breakers or fuses were popped so I turned the power back on to identify the issue. Smoke started rolling up from the floor in the center near the panel. I called the Tower told them that I had an electrical fire and that I would be turning off the power. I landed like normal without incident on my landing pad with no further incident.

Aircraft had history for slow starting since it was new; Our organization troubleshot per the aircraft and engine manufacturer's recommendations (Note: aircraft is under warranty) which ultimately led to removing original engine which was sent to the engine Mfg for evaluation and installing a rental engine provided by the engine mfg. Ground testing revealed loaner engine met all parameters for takeoff power and aircraft was released to service. Aircraft was returned to owner by a company professional pilot whom stated the aircraft flew normal and reported no anomalies. A while later the owner contacted us and said the aircraft flies slower than the published cruise numbers and later brought the aircraft back to us for a scheduled annual inspection at which time we performed performance runs and noted no power issues on the ground. We did recalibrate the auto throttle system thinking that may have been a factor but later the customer reported that it still was flying slower than published. On DATE we were notified by Name (A/C Mfg) and Name 2 and Name 3 (Eng MFG) that we had installed the wrong build spec engine on the aircraft even though it was the correct model engine which was the cause for it to fly slower. There is no mention of a certain build spec for installation in either the aircraft Type certificate or engine certificate nor is there any mention of it in any of the maintenance publications. The rental engine was reserved and provided by Name 2 and 3(Eng MFG). Our team received an email on DATE1 that rental engine S/N XXXXA had been reserved. The rental engine arrived to our facility on DATE2. We waited to open shipping crate until we received approval from Name 2 and 3 (Eng Mfg.); which was granted on DATE3. On DATE4 at XA:27CST Name 2 and 3 (Eng Mfg) provided email containing cert package for rental engine S/N XXXXA. On DATE4 at XB:43CST we received an email 'Please disregard my previous cert package. I have attached the correct one...'. The updated cert package was for rental engine S/N XXXXB. The original rental engine S/N XXXXB was the correct build spec for the aircraft. The rental engine S/N XXXXA that Name 2 and 3 (Eng Mfg.) had actually shipped was not the correct build spec; and as expressed earlier there is no guidance on any build spec requirements to install PT6A-66D.

I arrived at the gate at XX03Z because my [App] was crashing in Operations as I was unable to download my signed off release. I had to close the app out twice to finally have the signed flight plan downloaded. Upon arrival at the jet; I noticed a plan DG summary for aircraft batteries. I saw nothing about a human organ shipment as it stated on my [Flight] Release that we were a Medevac flight and ATC has been notified. I contacted Dispatch prior to arriving at the airport to see what we were carrying as a Medevac flight. It was a kidney. I believe it was about XX30Z; planned departure was XX40Z; that Ramp contacted me to say they were ready for brake release. I did receive the final DG summary for aircraft batteries; but nothing about the human organ shipment; so I asked them if they loaded a human organ shipment. They were not sure and that he will contact his Supervisor. At that time; I sent an ACARS message to load planning; with no response back on ACARS. We are now past scheduled departure time by 1 minute. I called Dispatch and he connected us to load planning who told us that a 'quickpack' of 4 lbs. was loaded in the aft cargo. Ramp verified that with me as well. All checklists were completed. We proceeded to push back per SOPs. My recommendation to this would be actual confirmation to the PIC (Pilot in Command) that shipment has been boarded when declared a Medevac flight.At XX48Z; (past scheduled departure) brakes were released; and command given to push to Spot XX using SOP push procedures. It seemed to me they pushed us to the Spot XY line; centering on that line and then proceeded to the XX line. They told me to set brakes when the aircraft was not on the XX line; but angled and pointed towards the XX Spot. I told them no; and to have the aircraft centered on the XX line and that there was an aircraft on XX Taxiway inbound for [Taxiway] XY who was going to be using the XC lane". They proceeded to attempt to center the aircraft on the taxilane; but we really never got on it. I suggested to them to pushback deep into the alleyway; but they started to and at the same time; the inbound aircraft was just abeam [Taxiway] XY and stopped as they saw our Ground Crew struggling. They started to turn our aircraft to the right and forward to get with the other aircraft abeam the gate. Our left Wingwalker remained at the nose of the aircraft and never returned to the left side. I told them to stop as I was worried that they were going to pull forward and not have the clearance with the other aircraft's tail without the Wingwalker. Another Ground Crew arrived at [Taxiway] XY to marshall in the inbound. Our crew pulled us up abeam XY; not centered on the line and told me to set brakes. I set the brakes as there was no safety concern at this point. The Tug Operator asked to disconnect. I said disconnect. I saw the tug and all wing walkers leave the area. We proceeded to start the #2 engine. Ran the after start checklist; contacted Ground Control and proceeded to complete the flight uneventfully. My mistake in this episode was forgetting to have them clear me for engine start before disconnecting."

ADSB/GPS Outage in the Denver Metro area. At around XA:00Z D01 notified ZZZ1 that there are GPS (to include ADSB) anomalies within 50 miles of Denver. We immediately started broadcasting this on the ATIS. As traffic has picked up today (still relatively slow for ZZZ1); we've had numerous reports of aircraft losing ADSB; and numerous reports of aircraft losing GPS. We also lost all ADSB on our side for approximately an hour. This is problematic for our operation. Since the implementation of ADSB; we have had many controllers train and certify using this feature. I am currently the only controller on shift that certified prior to ADSB. If our traffic was moderate it would be a safety concern; especially during a VFR pop up arrival rush. As for the GPS outages; most of the aircraft reported losing their GPS on finals from as far out as 15 miles to within 1 mile final. Luckily today is VFR. However; this time of year through April are our heaviest precipitation months.  Often strong frontal patterns move in quickly; with last minute changes in forecast. We provide service for pilots with little experience; and though today is VFR; many general aviation aircraft have returned to base due to GPS outages. We have logged aircraft reporting issues in our facility log. We currently have 11 reports. There are many that have inquired about outages; but did not report an outage themselves. We are not seeing all aircraft ADSB on our side. When we lose their ADSB in the pattern; we are full stopping them to keep the operation safe. We also have the concern for the aircraft that are losing their ADSB while flying under the Bravo airspace. I am simply passing along safety information. I have heard of a 'solar storm' and I am aware of the 5G implementation. I will not speculate on the cause of the outages today. I am hopeful you can find out what happened and fix it.

Busy VFR day at WVI; landing and departing Runway 20; uncontrolled. I was acting as a Safety Pilot for a friend for some practice approaches. We were lining up to Runway 20 after a departure with knowledge of an Aircraft Z on a left base. We delayed our takeoff roll; announced a left crosswind departure and Aircraft Z ended up announcing a go-around due to us being on the runway. As we rotated about 50 ft. above the ground; Aircraft Z overflew us by about 50 ft. then made a left turn. Out of reaction; we adjusted our pitch up and it was particularly dangerous in that critical climbout phase with gear/flaps in the transition to be pulled up; thus lost of lift. Although we had right of way in that situation; it was a better decision to reject the takeoff or announce a delayed takeoff. Aircraft Z should've went around with a slight offset to the right. Complacency and the inaction on our part to efficiently use the runway; but there's a slight chance the Aircraft Z was flying fast in.On the return leg we were entering a 45 for a left downwind 20. Aircraft Y was inbound over the city of Gilroy on a straight in to 20. It was an easy decision but we followed them in without a factor; but it required a lot of coordination over the radio of who was following who when Aircraft Y should've flown the standard pattern entry to follow us in.

Night arrival on the JANNY 5. Outbound after WABBT and level at 5000 ft. MSL as assigned by ATC; received 'Whoop; Whoop; Pull Up' advisory from EGPWS (Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System). As Pilot Flying; initiated response by disconnecting the autopilot; maximum thrust; while pitching nose up while maintaining assigned heading. Advisory quickly went away and leveled at 5200 ft. MSL; notifying ATC. Descended back to 5000 FT and re-engaged the autopilot. No aircraft conflict during maneuver. Noticed [a] hill underneath the aircraft prior to EGPWS activation; but did not present itself as a threat visually. Also noted 'RA' on the MFD (Multi-function Flight Display) presented with terrain pop up during advisory.Wonder if the radio altimeter had malfunctioned due to 5G interference. As mentioned earlier; 'RA' flashed on the MFD with terrain pop up; and the Radio Altimeter varied prior to advisory. Though it was dark; the terrain did not visually present itself as a threat as I was looking outside throughout; and 5000 ft. is a normal vectoring altitude for ATC in that area. The only other possible cause would be closure rate with the terrain; we were flying at about 230 kts. due to traffic behind us. No real suggestion; except to see if 5G interference can trigger spurious EGPWS advisories.

Upon arriving at the aircraft; the Captain and myself reviewed the logbook. Upon review; we found a previously written up ELAC fault; and a failure of an elevator servojack. Both of these write ups had been cleared. We noted that the write up of the elevator servojack indicated that the aircraft had reverted into Alternate Law. During our cockpit preparations; a Flight Control Class II message appeared; was written up; and placed on MEL.While en route; during the course of my normal instrument scan; I noticed that an ECAM had appeared for F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; indicating a fault of the Yellow elevator servojack. I should note that the aircraft did not provide any auditory warnings that this ECAM had occurred; leading us to believe that the FWC (Flight Warning Computer) may have failed also.We performed the ECAM actions and reviewed the QRH. This caused us to discuss the fact that this ECAM had been previously written up. We cleared the ECAM item; and shortly thereafter; we saw another ECAM appear.This was the same ECAM of F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; but now the Green elevator servojack was implicated by the fault. As such; we had now lost half the servojacks on the elevator.At this point; we discussed among ourselves the possibility of the aircraft reverting into alternate law; as this had happened to a previous crew in the previous 2 days. As such; we reviewed the alternate law QRH; and setup the aircraft to land flaps 3 in case we experienced a reversion into alternate law later in the flight. We reviewed the landing distance requirements; and after discussing the issue with Maintenance Control and Dispatch via SATCOM; determined we had the requisite landing distance to continue to ZZZ.No further failures occurred; and we landed without incident. Upon arrival; the Captain wrote up both the servojack failures and the FWC not provided any auditory indications of an ECAM.We briefly discussed the failures with a mechanic; and the crew that was taking over the aircraft.At this point; we proceeded to our next aircraft in order to continue our trip. While we were pushing back; we realized that the aircraft we had written up was also pushing back. This leads me to believe the failed system were simply reset and the aircraft returned to service without troubleshooting.

I landed Runway XX in ZZZ during VMC conditions and exited the runway on A4. At that point; contacted ground and received clearance to taxi to parking (foxtrot) via alpha; cross XX. My student and I were taxing on alpha and wanted to double check to make sure we were cleared to cross Runway XX. Ground then confirmed we were cleared to cross Runway XX. We continued to taxi. As we approached Runway XX; my student and I proceeded to visually check Runway XX for traffic as a precaution. To the right; we saw an aircraft taking off Runway XX. Had we not held short of Runway XX at that time or checked late; there could have been a collision on the runway. Thankfully we held short. At that point I called tower and stated we were holding short of Runway XX for the plane that just took off. Tower then cleared us to cross XX for the 3rd time and apologized.

Horizontal stab trim quit working. On final at 1500 ft. AGL with the autopilot disconnected; it was discovered that the stabilizer was stuck at 8 degrees ANU (Airplane Nose Up). No associated Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) message. Control wheel stopper working on either side or the manual levers would operate the stab trim. Elected to continue the approach as the aircraft was fully configured and remained stable with some forward yoke pressure. Landed normally.

After returning from a routine training flight; my student and I were established in the downwind. While clearing base; I noticed oncoming traffic for what appeared to be an extended final Runway 10; same runway we were landing. I established radio communications with the other aircraft at this point; they previously made no radio calls. He reported having me in sight only after I inquired. After resolving the issue and assuring proper separation; my aircraft turned base from an extended downwind. At this time; the other pilot made a descending left turn from 1800 ft. to a high base; all 1/2 mile west of the approach end of Runway 10. He was again pointing toward me as I was now on final. I repeatedly informed the aircraft of our intent to land and back taxi; as our parallel taxiway is closed per NOTAM. My student landed while I monitored ADS-B In on my EFB. This was our most valuable tool and gave increased SA (Situational Awareness) which resolved what could have been several collision hazards in the pattern before they even became an issue. While on short final; I again called CTAF explaining my intent to land and back taxi. My EFB showed him 300 ft. above me and 1/4 mile behind at this point. Expecting him to go around; I did not execute a go around as I was lower in the pattern and on short final. After landing and turning to back taxi; I saw the offending aircraft sitting on the Runway 10 numbers. He had landed seconds after me; behind me by about 800 ft.; on an active runway. Radio comms directed to his specific tail number increased SA and prevented any collisions. But his omission of radio calls; SA; non-standard pattern use; and dangerous ADM caused a runway incursion.

On Date; at about XA45 Pacific daylight time; I checked in with ZZZ Center for VFR flight following to my planned destination airport; ZZZ1. I was at my cruise altitude of 10;500 feet MSL. At approximately XA54 there was a loud bang from my engine and I immediately lost power; although the engine was still running roughly. I had smoke coming into the cockpit which smelled like hot engine oil. I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center and explained my situation. They asked how many souls were on board and how much fuel I had. I advised that [a passenger] and I were the only people on board and that we had just refueled at ZZZ2. Center asked what my intentions were and I stated that we were going to try and make it to ZZZ. ZZZ Center advised me to switch to ZZZ Field Tower frequency; which I did. I contacted ZZZ Tower and advised them of our situation and our intention to make it to their field. At about XB01 hours the engine stopped and I shut off the fuel and the magnetos. I advised ZZZ Tower that the engine had stopped and that I had shut off the fuel and magnetos. I was able to make an uneventful; gliding landing; at ZZZ Field at approximately XB05 hours and coasted off of the Runway onto Taxiway 1. My [passenger] and I got out of our airplane and looked under the cowling and noticed internal pieces of our engine sitting on top of the exterior of the engine. There were no injuries and there was no other damage to the aircraft other than the ruptured engine.

Original aircraft before swap had a mechanical failure with the horizontal stabilizer trim. The FO (First Officer) went to set trim but electric switch failed to operate as it had at gate. Captain side failed too. Trim wheel was stuck and unmovable in the manual mode. After return to gate mechanics confirm electric motor ceased and bonded the trim system. Concern is that if this happened in flight there would be no operable stabilizer trim and could make flight difficult or hazardous. So far unknown as to why manual trim became unavailable with electric motor inoperable.

At least 20 miles southwest of ZZZ; I checked the airport information on Foreflight and checked for NOTAMs and found none. I made my first radio call on UNICOM; 8 miles southwest of ZZZ with intention of doing a touch and go on the only Runway. I heard a gyrocopter call departing the pattern to the north. I made my next radio call 3 miles southwest; intending to fly northbound on the west side of the airport well outside the pattern; then make a 270 degree turn to enter the left traffic pattern on a 45 degree leg.I then heard another fixed wing aircraft report 6 miles west of the airport. I decided to abandon my initial plan and made a call to inform her that I would be entering the pattern on base leg to avoid any conflict with her. She (the fixed wing) acknowledged. I entered the pattern on a 1.5 mile base leg and then turned final and made a radio call on final. Approx 1/2 mile from the threshold; my partner pointed out a gyrocopter on left base cutting in front of us; about 200 feet above and to our left; turning a tight left base to final.It was a white; open cockpit gyrocopter. Our closest separation was approx 200 feet. I was at the lower altitude momentarily on final. I took evasive action by side-stepping right to the upwind leg to keep the gyro in sight as it landed. I performed a go-around on the upwind leg and exited the pattern straight out to the north. I heard radio traffic from the ground 'hey you just cut in front of that fixed wing' but no acknowledgment from the gyro pilot. We noticed that the airport grounds had a large number of trailers; maybe campers; and surmised they may be having a gyrocopter rally. I asked them on the radio if they had filed a NOTAM and they said yes; but the event doesn't start until tomorrow. On Date I checked the FAA NOTAM website and found none for the event. I called FSS and asked about NOTAMs for ZZZ and they had none. I asked how to file a near mid-air collision report. They said they could not take a report because gyrocopters are certificated aircraft and are not required to file a NOTAM for gatherings.They declined to take a near mid-air report. Seems to me they are making a judgment before even hearing the facts. I am filing this report because I think a NOTAM should be required for gatherings where a large number of NORDO aircraft might be present. I am also filing this report because the gyro pilots may try to find fault with me for not flying a full traffic pattern. I took the action I did (not flying a downwind) because 1) I heard no other aircraft on the radio in the pattern and 2) I wanted to avoid conflict and maintain spacing before the other fixed wing aircraft approaching the pattern - she acknowledged me and said I was in sight and she was number two.

This report is filed to bring attention to the highest levels. I have used LAX as a baseline but my concern is not inclusive of LAX as every airport facility using the new LED lights to illuminate the ramp areas is culpable. The LED lights recently installed at LAX; PDX; SEA; and many other airport facilities are too bright. When I taxi in from relatively dark taxiways and am subjected to bright white lights shining directly into my eyes it causes a temporary loss of full visual functionality. To the point that it is difficult to retain focus on the marshaler and the lit wands during the most critical phase of taxi; pulling up to the jet bridge and terminal building. Please consider reverting to amber; or other; colored LED lights instead of white LED lights as they are less impactful on nighttime visual acuity of the human eye. Additionally; please consider any other mitigation factors available from an engineering/design perspective (i.e. changing the height; angle; or position of the lights) that might enhance the safety of flight operations at night.

At FL390 the autopilot did an uncommanded disengagement and we received a sel elev feel man (Select Elevator Fell to Manual) Level 2 alert on EAD (Engine and Aircraft Display). The aircraft became more difficult to control. The aircraft began to decelerate. We avoided a stall using the AOA reference. We completed the QRH for the sel elev feel man Level 2 alert and discovered the First Officer side airspeed indicator unreliable. We then completed the QRH for Airspeed Unreliable. We requested [priority handling] and landed uneventfully at ZZZ.After the event; I was very thankful for the training I received on unreliable airspeed events. I feel that the sim training helped us identify the unreliable airspeed problem more quickly; which is something that is not immediately obvious to a flight crew. I really feel that the simulator training contributed to the positive outcome of this event.

We received a Gear Disagree Warning after raising the gear. I called for the Gear Disagree QRH checklist. I advised ATC we were returning and received vectors for the approach right away. The First Officer was doing the checklist; after takeoff checklist. By now there was a HYD LO PRESS Caution for SYS 3. We were joining the final for ILS XX with a gear down and 3 green indication and all primary and secondary; FLT Controls working normally. I elected to land because of this. I had advised ATC of a HYD issue . They declared [priority handling] themselves. The landing was fine with loss of braking and nose wheel steering. I was able to clear the runway and stop on the taxiway. We asked for a tow to the gate from there. We were airborne for 10 minutes. We advised the Flight Attendants we were returning. There was no time to message dispatch. With more time we certainly would have advised them of the issue. My First Officer did an outstanding job I feel. His non flying pilot duties were done without my input; to accomplish this as quickly as it occurred.

Set up for RNAV arrival into DEN Runway 17R. Briefed contingencies if given the visual approach. When visual approach was given; I extended JNKBX; as previously briefed. We were to treat established inbound on this extension as on the approach." As we were established on this segment; the PF (Pilot Flying) called to set touchdown elevation; which I did. I then went heads down and looked up the Tower frequency and entered the Tower frequency into the radio number 1 standby window. At this point; I looked outside and then cross checked the instruments and saw we were descending through 6;500 ft. I said; "Why are we so low?" and told the F/O (First Officer) (PF) to climb to 7;000 [ft]. At this point; the Approach Controller called with an altitude warning. I replied that were were climbing to 7;000 and we resumed visually the rest of the way to touchdown without incident. The PF had selected LEVEL CHANGE without announcing it (and followed the flight directors blindly) and left the protections of VNAV. A lengthy debrief followed on the proper sequence of events; the protections provided and discarded by his actions and the reasons for following the established SOP."

At the gate; before push back; with due diligence downloaded our route; departure Runway 8R; SID-KMIA FOLZZ1 FOLZZ; and ATC route clearance amendments FOLZZ DIR ZFP DIR BAAGR DIR GRATX then as filed; manually into the FMC. We then reviewed route and points individually as per normal procedures; all good. On the ATC clearance uplink the amended points came up as FOLZZ-N2617.3W07920.9; ZFP-N2633.3W07841.8; BAAGR-N2649.0W07631.3. When input manually to the FMC for example ZFP you get two choices of Lat Long's to choose from; so you pick the one with the corresponding Lat Long's....etc.                                                                 However; it was noted later at the gate that we could have just auto uploaded the ATC amended part of the clearance through the FMC ATC clearance LOAD button which would have put in the ZFP and BAAGR points with the correct Lat Long's less chance of error....'See-Check it out!' I obviously must have pushed that button. No excuse; as I've read many reports from other professional pilots-colleagues on our team sharing similar events. I respect and thank them for sharing so I wouldn't make this mistake. Some of our pilots; new to aircraft and/or don't fly much; great to review things but; there is the right time and place. My timing was bad to review any FMC operations. I should have checked to see; after my FMC review with the FO; that I hadn't messed up our original route data.

We received the aircraft from another flight crew who stated the aircraft was 'fine' and only had the Nose Wheel steering switch off set vertically by about 20 degrees. I visually confirmed that the switch was offset vertically; and still moved and functioned appropriately. I asked my First Officer check the nose gear carefully during her walk around. She came back and stated everything was good outside. We continued normal operations.During the initial climb after rotation; I remarked during gear retraction that 'the nose wheel seemed awfully loud' and it successfully retracted with no sensor errors reported on the Flight Deck. The noise ceased on gear retraction. We continued our flight as normal. During approach and landing; the nose gear did not make any noise different than as expected on our day to day operations. Touch down of the main gear was fine; until the nose wheel made contact with the runway.The aircraft began to steer right at about 2-3 degrees a second; which I immediately began applying opposite rudder. When that was not working; I add right only brake to bring the aircraft nose back toward center line. Then the nose started going to the right at 2-3 degrees a second. I swapped inputs to left rudder and brake. Once the aircraft nose started coming back left; I applied strong brake pressure on both mains and slowed down to a speed where I could safely exit the runway. This all happened in the span of 5-10 seconds. As the aircraft slowed down; it was more under control; than at the higher ground speed upon landing.After we taxied to the gate; I had my First Officer do a walk around and asked her to check the nose carefully; as I called Maintenance. When she came back she remarked how the Nose was 'fully extended;' in which the Maintenance Controller remarked that 'the swerving would be attributed to an over extended nose strut.'The next day I spoke with a crew that was ferrying the aircraft out of ZZZ; and explained the entire narrative above. The Captain was very appreciative; since this 'filled in the gaps' for what his ferry flight was for.

I cleared Aircraft X for the VOR-A Approach into HII.  I cleared the aircraft to cross EED AOA FL059 and then cleared for the approach.  In my opinion it sounded like the pilot read back the correct restriction at EED although the frequencies are terrible at that sector and might have caused it to sound like a correct read back.  The MSAW alert did NOT go off and I happen to notice the aircraft was below the MEA and at FL057.  I issued a low altitude alert and told the aircraft to climb to FL059.  Once I observed the aircraft at a safe altitude (FL060); I recleared the aircraft for the VOR-A approach.  The pilot did seem to be in a training flight which might have also caused this.  We really need to get better radio sites at sector 6.  This has been an issue for several years and multiple reports have been filed with no resolve. Area D has eventually given up on filing reports for the radios since we have been told nothing can be done.  If there was a bad read back then better radios would have certainly prevented this from happening.  There are times when mains/standbys/BUECS (Back Up Emergency Communication System) do not work and the only way to reach a pilot is by aircraft relay.  Aircraft relays are to the point where they have to be used almost every session at this sector.  As a regular occurrence; when we are able to reach pilots it is hard to understand them.

Performing a #2 service on Aircraft X; found door 2R emergency exit light assembly not installed. Further troubleshooting discovered the area had been panlamed over. Gained access to lower panel of aft galley and found wires dangling. Had to order new lite assembly to install and hook up wiring. Similar to Aircraft Y which had same problem 2 days earlier.

We had loaded; verified and both checked that the Departure SID was loaded in the FMS and verified against our ATC clearance even before pushback. We again verified the departure SID as part of navigation brief as part of the before T/O checklist. We departed ZZZ on a 160 heading. Shortly thereafter while climbing through approximately 15;000 ft MSL we were cleared direct to the ZZZZZ fix on the Departure. We selected that fix for direct to and executed it in the FMS. We selected LMAV and verified it on the FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator). The aircraft turned and flew to ZZZZZ in a climb while on the autopilot. We were switched from ZZZ1 Departure to ZZZ2 Center enroute to ZZZZZ in climb. After being cleared to climb to FL230 ZZZ2 [Center] asked us to verify what fix we were direct to at that time. We both reviewed the LEGS page immediately and discovered that the FMS had dropped 4 NAV points on the SID after the ZZZZZ fix. The FMS had taken us to ZZZZZ and reverted to heading at some point. The 4 NAV points after ZZZZZ that were dropped were ZZZZZ1; ZZZZZ2; ZZZZZ3 and ZZZZZ4. There was no annunciation that the aircraft had reverted to Heading Mode nor that the NAV points had been dropped from the FMS. Both GPS's appeared normal; there was no traffic conflict reported by ATC. There were no indications of IRS (Inertial Reference System) issues apparent. We were flying near where GPS jamming occurs sometimes but there were no NOTAMS on jamming. We were given a 170 vector for a brief time and then given direct to ZZZ1 on the SID which was still in the FMS as part of the Departure SID. We continued on in our climb and finished flight to ZZZ3. As additional note we discovered that on beginning the Arrival STAR into ZZZ3 that the preloaded altitudes for the NAV point ZZZZZ5 had dropped from the FMS. I had already verified the altitudes at ZZZZZ5 twice as the FO (First Officer) and the Captain had also verified the altitudes loaded in the FMS prior to descent. There was no annunciation of the altitudes for ZZZZZ5 dropping from the FMS. Luckily we found out ahead of the fix. After the flight we alerted maintenance and made a write up in the maintenance logbook. There were no more issues during the flight.

Taxiing out on Taxiway H to Runway 4 for takeoff; I commented to First Officer that I haven't taken off on [Runway] 4 for over a year. We were cleared to cross 13L and R. Approaching former Runway 17/35; I became confused; because the Runway hold markings were still on the pavement; so I brought the aircraft to a stop and queried ATC; who confirmed the Runway was closed as depicted on the 10/9 chart. An additional Safety concern is all the Gate location signs (the number of the Gates) in HOU are extremely faded and almost impossible to read. Remove or paint over outdated markings on airport pavement. Repaint gate location signs in HOU.

Arriving to aircraft at ZZZ gate; halfway down the jetway I noticed the 'smelly sock' odor. Once on the aircraft the smell [was] strong. The APU was on with APU bleed air supplying the packs as well the gate ground air being hooked up and supplying ground air. Went outside and turned off the ground air. Once back on the aircraft I noticed the smell became even more pungent. I turned off the APU bleed air and turned off the APU and the flight attendants who were on board exited the aircraft. Once the APU bleed air was off and the APU was shut down the odor began to dissipate. The entire crew exited the aircraft and a logbook entry for the fume event was made in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook.

I was flying solo; practicing touch and goes in the traffic pattern. On my 5th landing; I was on a left base for Runway XX at ZZZ when I saw a traffic alert on my GPS as well as Fore Flight that stated traffic at same altitude. I visually scanned for traffic outside and saw Aircraft Y flying straight at me. The aircraft ended up climbing and flew 100 ft. above me. I asked what his intentions were on the radio and it was unclear to me what he said. He then asked me what I was doing and another instructor who was in the pattern told him that he had almost hit me. He then proceeded to maneuver west to enter the pattern on a 45; and cut in front of that instructor on their downwind for Runway XX.

I issued a MEL 21-XX-a and checked the history but it was not clear to me on what flight the MEL previously was closed in ZZZ. So it repeated on the next flight leg and i issued a new MEL but should have re-opened the previous MEL. Unclear in safe on what flight the MEL was cleared in ZZZ on date. System upgrade to avoid issuing a new MELfor an previously closed MEL.

Aircraft X arrived in ZZZ with a pilot write up for #2 Full authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) ALTN followed Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) procedures and no help. Upon troubleshooting found multiple flight legs showing faults in both EEC2A and EEC2B which would be cause for an OOS (Out of Service) event due to being unable to defer the FADEC. I relayed this information to my Supervisor and was asked to stay late and assist the other mechanics as I was the only qualified; eligible mechanic on the MD-11 that evening. I informed my Supervisor that I had a TDY in the morning and that I had to drive to my TDY location and would not be able to stay. I found that 2 mechanics Person A and Person B were forced to stay and replace a Relay that Maintenance Control believed to be the cause of the issue. I decided that I would stay and assist them with the engine runs as they were unfortunate enough to be forced incorrectly based on the rules which state the least senior mechanics on shift were supposed to be forced.Person A and Person B changed the relay and I performed the Engine Runs on #2; during the runs no faults were noted and after 5 mins I shut down the engine and checked for faults in EEC2A and EEC2B; only EEC2B showed a fault for 2.95 BLD which I informed my Supervisor of and upon him speaking with Maintenance Control we found this was a deferrable issue. During the process of signing the logbook; my Supervisor handed me the MEL required and said he was speaking with Maintenance Control about the deferral. Person A signed off the Replacement of the relay and began documenting the fault and MEL on the following step leaving blank the SOT for the Control Number once the MEL was called in. It was at this moment that my Supervisor informed us that the airplane was being placed OOS for a Possible HYD leak in the tail; this caused myself; Person A and Person B to speak up as to why then be forced to fix an issue that would cause the airplane to go OOS if he was going to put it OOS regardless. After this discussion with my Supervisor we all called fatigue and decided to leave and work the aircraft in the morning since it would be OOS and I would travel on TDY in the morning. During this time and lack of communication I failed to call Maintenance Control to document the MEL procedure and receive a control number for the MEL. After 2 days I received a phone call today; from the ZZZ NDA supervisor advising me that they were trying to impact the paperwork for Aircraft X and were unable to impact the MEL as there was no Control Number for it. I contacted Maintenance Control and explained to them what had happened and that I had dropped the ball by documenting the fault and corrective action but failed to contact them for the deferral; it was at this time that I was informed by Maintenance Control that due to me being on TDY at another gateway; I could not legally document the Deferral for an Aircraft in ZZZ; and it would have to be redone in ZZZ.

On initial gear extension; 'gear unsafe' light illuminated and did not get any green gear lights to illuminate.  Executed a go-around at approximately 1000 ft. AGL.  Once at a safe altitude and in level flight; referenced the POH and performed the 'Landing gear unsafe' checklist. After performing the checklist; I was faced with a left main gear unsafe indication; right main and nose indicated safe.  I elected to contact ZZZ Approach to perform a fly by with the tower to visually check my left main gear.  They verbally confirmed the left main was down but could not confirm (nor would I expect) that the gear was locked. Having already [requested priority handling]; they suggested I land at ZZZ1.  However; based on Runway XX at ZZZ and the unobstructed grass on the left side of the runway; I elected to land with the left-wing overhanging the grass.  This scenario allowed that if the left main collapsed; the left wing would be in the grass and not potentially rupture the wing tank and create friction of metal on cement.  Fortunately; the gear was down and the landing uneventful.  Due to an unsafe gear indication; I stopped straight ahead and shut down the airplane.  On visual inspection; the gear was not locked but was down; thus a turn to the right may have caused the gear to 'fold' up under the left wing.Although emergency resources were more available at ZZZ1; my decision to go to ZZZ was grounded in the clear (no lights or obstruction) alongside Runway XX/XY.  I maintained my [priority] status with ZZZ Approach until safely on the ground at ZZZ.

Weather exploded east of ELP; traffic quickly began to overwhelm the controller on Sector X who was working Aircraft X. Frequency congestion was a nightmare; the gigantic sector; the multiple transmitter sites; the planes all calling to deviate; and the bottleneck around ELP; Mexico; White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The Controller was extremely busy; I was listening to him go down the tubes. I started out on the D-side on Sector Y and we were quickly in the same boat as the Controller on Sector X. Sector X Controller realized too late that Aircraft X was deviating north towards [Restricted Area] R-XXXX which was active FL300 and below. After taking the hand off; I realized the same thing; the Sector X Controller gave a hard vector south to a 190 heading and used the term immediately. I saw conflict alert go off with the Aircraft operating in R-XXXX; which we think was a military drone. The TCAS didn't go off on Aircraft X. The Pilot of Aircraft X checked on stating he turned south to miss a drone; not sure if that was an evasive maneuver or from the heading given from the Sector X Controller. We had to go into no notice holding as we got so busy; we couldn't insure separation of aircraft from each other or the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The weather quickly built and traffic quickly overwhelmed the SE specialty. Command Center / Traffic Management Unit (TMU) constantly neglect the complexity of us working traffic through this area. There is a lot of pressure for us to not hold; not lower the map numbers; not route planes north. I would recommend that we have a specific Pro-day for the SE and SW specialties to practice different routes and holding scenarios; and also have upper management encourage us to take this action sooner rather than waiting and trying just 'make it work' or 'just get through this shift'. There is a pernicious attitude that pervades both the SE; management; Traffic Management Unit and ZAB as a whole to never do this; that we change this culture.

Trigger...at FL380 was given descent to FL340. At approximately FL360; the CAB PRESS status page displayed showing a cabin altitude of 9;500 feet and rising. Action requested priority handling with ZZZ ATC; started rapid descent to 10;000 feet; seat belt sign on. First Officer (FO) and pilot flying; performed a maneuver with the autopilot on. ATC gave us initial descent to FL270 and a frequency change. New Controller gave us descent to 10;000 feet with altimeter setting of 29.80. We were in VFR conditions; minimum safe altitude from charts approximately 5;000 feet. FO was able to descend quickly enough that a CABIN ALTITUDE ECAM did not trigger nor did the oxygen masks deploy in the cabin. I was able to speak with FA1; during the descent. FA1 confirmed that passengers were okay and did not report any injuries but would update us if something changed. I made a PA to passengers about aircraft condition and plan of action. Requested all to remain seated until in ZZZ.After level off and confirming aircraft was safe to continue; removed the aircraft alert from ZZZ ATC; but requested priority handling into ZZZ. Sent ACARS message to Dispatch. Stated our problem; action; current situation and plan. Received acknowledgment and new fuel remaining calculation for Denver at 10;000 feet. Highest cabin altitude was 11;350 feet. No ECAMs showed on the upper display. Outflow valve; inlet and extract vents all showed closed. During level off; safety valve opened when cabin diff pressure at -.5 PSI. Remaining flight was uneventful to a landing at ZZZ; XXR. Taxi to Gate at XX. Met by ZZZ maintenance and ZZZ FO representative.

I did my normal before take off check list and procedures; including a normal pre flight. I announced my take off; rolled onto the runway and put power in. I did not take off in the expected distance. The airplane appeared to be making less power than usual. I aborted the take off; however with the wet runway there was no way to use full braking action. I could only use brakes to the extent to keep the airplane tracking straight down the runway. Using full brakes would have resulted in going off of the runway to the right or left with great potential of flipping the airplane over. Not being able to use normal braking action; I went off the end of Runway XX and came to a stop shortly after the end of the runway. There is a grassy down slope about 2 to 3 feet deep that we came to a stop in. I am unsure what caused the power loss; the wet surface made it impossible to stop in time.

Upon arrival to the plane in ZZZ; a couple of the flight attendants and the first officer; informed me that there had been an unpleasant smell like cleaning solution or a dead animal on the plane but that it had dissipated.  I asked if they were sure it was not a electrical or dirty sock smell (indicative of burned oil getting in the packs)  They assured me it was not.  The smell did not reoccur until in the air: Near the top of climb or just after leveling off; we got a SMOKE CREW REST F/D EICAS caution message.  As this EICAS caution does not have an enunciated checklist and there was no evidence of fire or smoke. I contacted the flight attendants and asked that they check the crew rest area and we began the Smoke; Fire or Fumes checklist.  Moments later; the EICAS caution message disappeared.  The flight attendants reported that they briefly smelled something like cleaning solution when they opened the crew rest door but that it dissipated almost immediately.  The first officer and I decided we should consult maintenance control through SATCOMM.  Before we connected with the dispatcher; the EICAS message briefly reappeared and disappeared.  The EICAS warning did not reoccur again after the second time.  After considering all the evidence; maintenance advised us that it would be OK to continue the flight.  We asked the flight attendants to contact us immediately if they smelled; felt; or saw anything indicating smoke or fire.  The cruise portion of the flight continued without incident; but we remained attentive to possible alternates should anything more occur.  Just before the top of descent; we received a call from the flight attendant in the back of the aircraft.  We had just received our descent clearance into ZZZ1 and a runway change from the ILS 12 to the RNAV Z 12 which generated discontinuity in the arrival.  (an anomaly) We both needed to be present to straighten this out; so I informed the flight attendant that I had to go to get the plane on the ground.About one minute after clearing the runway and before starting the APU; we received a call from the back of the aircraft from a flight attendant reporting an electrical smell.  (It was quite confusing as a slight majority of the flight attendants were reporting the smell of cleaning solution and this one thought it smelled like electrical.)In light of that description; we asked ground control to send the fire department to meet us at the gate.  (I didn't anticipate an evacuation; but felt it was imperative to get the passengers off the plane as soon as possible to avoid the inhalation of fumes should they have occurred.  This is why we proceeded to the gate and asked the fire department to meet us at the there.  Thinking that the smell couldn't be coming from the APU as it was not running when the smell was reported after landing nor during climb; we started the APU so that we could shut down the engines and emergency deplane at the gate should it be necessary.The fire department didn't find any evidence of fire inside the passenger compartment; the baggage compartment; the exterior or any other part of the plane.  Maintenance came on board and asked us to shut down the APU as they all agreed that it was burned oil or hydraulic fluid they could smell; the passengers and flight attendants were off the plane at that point; so I instructed the cleaners to leave the plane and we shut down the APU and left the plane to the mechanics.  Unfortunately; after I left the plane; I was informed from the Chief Pilot in ZZZ that one of the flight attendants had complained to her supervisor about how the situation was handled.  We had very little time to deal with both calls from the back of the plane as we were task saturated in both cases and our priority was getting the plane where it needed to be.   Apparently; something was wrong with the airplane which allowed the odor of burned oil or hydraulic fluid to intermittently enter the cabin.  It isn't really possible to determine if an odor is a threat from it's characteristics (how it smells). In the future; if there is a smell on an aircraft; I will follow the Aircraft Odor - Ground checklist (which I didn't realize existed.) and make an entry in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook no matter what the odor smells like.

I was landing on Runway XX which was being used by the ILS and other airport traffic. AWOS reported wind as variable at 3 KTS. After making a three point touch-town the aircraft began to turn to the right and I corrected with left rudder and left brake inputs. The aircraft continued to the right until the left wing contacted the runway and the airplane 'ground looped' damaging the left wing and aileron. There was no propeller strike and the engine continued to idle until I shut it down.

During climb through 5500 out of ZZZ to ZZZ1 right engine CGR [engine] monitor and red warning indicator on panel both indicated oil temperature in the red. Oil pressure indicated drop down in the yellow. Initially increased mixture on right engine and reduced power. Observed no change during slow climb. Leveled off and reported to ATC that I needed precautionary return with priority handling to the field due to abnormal engine indications. No change in temp and pressure during vectors back to the field. Elected to pull power back to just above idle to maximize cooling while giving minimal thrust to maintain safe and effective aircraft control. [Advised ATC] upon indications not changing. 4-5 minutes after starting the return the oil temp started to drop back to high normal range. Oil pressure remained low due to power setting. I elected to keep the minimal power setting during the landing.

We were conducting a series of drone flights in support of a science project at the school. Our position was just outside surface Class C airspace for ZZZ. The intent was to fly directly vertically from the top of our building; hover the drone at a fixed location directly above the building and at altitude of 375 ft above the roof; and measure temperature and humidity for 15-20 minutes before landing; replacing the battery; and launching again. We had successfully completed five uneventful flights over several days; with two of those successful flights occurring earlier today. In all previous flight; the positioning and control of the drone had been rock solid.  On the third flight of the day; the drone was again commanded to ascend to 375 ft above the launch point; and around the time it reached that altitude; it suddenly reported a compass error that I had never seen before; and it yawed an unknown amount from its originally north heading. The student visual observer; who had briefly looked away; reported to me that it was no longer in its expected position directly over us. Shortly thereafter; the drone reported a problem with the GPS lock as well. Neither of us were able to determine visually in which direction the drone had moved; and the video feed from the downward-viewing camera that I had been partly relying on to monitor the drone's position over the building became very poor; with only sporadic updates. Very soon; the occasional video refreshes that we got showed that the drone had; uncommanded; moved well out over the Lake; or at least 0.5 NM away from our position. Because I had lost positional awareness; I did not execute any positioning commands whatsoever except yaw to try bring our building into view of the camera in the hope that I could manually navigate it back home. Before I could do that; the video feed became unusable; and in short order; the control link was lost altogether as well.  Because of the reported GPS problem and because I didn't know why it had flown away; I was also reluctant to send a return-to-home command; because I didn't know whether the drone had reliable position information and whether it would return to the correct starting point.We had not been able to ascertain in exactly which direction it had gone or how far it had gone; but at some point the link was reestablished; and it became apparent that the drone was approaching from the northeast and automatically executing a return-to-home due to the lost link.  We reacquired it visually when it was perhaps half a mile from us; and it then automatically landed again on the building roof without further incident.During the period when it wasn't under positive control; it busted the 400 ft AGL altitude limit; because it was no longer directly over our 150 ft tall building and was probably at around 525 ft relative to the surrounding terrain. And because of the direction from which it returned; we also suspect; but are not yet certain; that it busted the surface Class C airspace that begins just a few city blocks to our northeast.  It's because of these two issues that I'm filing this report.I don't know why we experienced this problem after a number of uneventful flights; but I can't rule out radio frequency interference; especially given the compass error; loss of GPS lock; and poor video feed all occurring at nearly the same time. Our lapse in maintaining continuous visual contact was a contributing factor; because once it moved away from the expected position; we lost all situational awareness and were unable to effectively intervene to manually bring it back to the building.A factor in losing visual contact was that the drone had remained reliably directly above us; stable as a rock; for all previous flights; and it was strenuous to keep looking straight up for long periods of time. There was no better vantage point because of the confines of the roof; and there was never previously any difficulty spotting it again after briefly looking away; which led to complacency.

While conducting the ILS approach to Runway 31 at DSM I received a low altitude alert from the Approach Controller; was instructed to climb to 2500 ft. I did so; intercepted the glideslope and made a normal landing.I was cleared to and cross CYCLN (IAF) at or above 3000 ft.; cleared for the ILS 31 approach. Hand flying (no AP) I descended to 3000 ft.; flew direct to CYCLN; turned right to join the localizer. I crossed over CYCLN and descended to the next lower altitude of 2400 ft. until FOREM (FAF). At 2400 ft. I was above the broken cloud layer; I had Ground contact at this time; the layer appeared to be thin. My localizer needle bounced full left then right then slightly left indicating I was slightly right of the localizer centerline; while confirming the Garmin 430 non WAAS was in the correct mode (I had previously confirmed this but was taken back by the needle bounce) I simultaneously accidentally pulled my approach plate and airport diagram off the yoke clip (I'm old school and prefer paper as opposed to iPad) spent several seconds looking between my legs for it; finally retrieved it off the floor; started correcting to the left. The Controller issued a 'low altitude alert' and instructed me to climb to 2500 ft. until established on the localizer. At this time; I was at 2000 ft.; I immediately climbed to 2500 ft.; course corrected slightly left; became established on the localizer; intercepted the glide slope; handed off to Tower and made a normal on course stabilized approach; I broke out with good visibility (2-3 miles) just as I passed FOREM around 1200 ft. agl; landed normally.Altitude deviation due to last minute troubleshooting the radio setup and bending down to floor to find lost papers resulted in forward pressure on yoke and resulted in a descent.

After finishing my preflight inspection; I started the airplane and announced on the radio that I would be taxing to runway XY. Along the way there; there were no other aircraft on frequency making radio calls. Once I arrived at the hold short line for runway XX; I looked for traffic and I did not see any aircraft approaching runway XX. No one had made any radio calls; and there was no traffic shown on [my aircraft's] GPS with ADSB. I then announced that I was crossing runway XX at Taxiway 1. After that; I began crossing the runway and as I was clearing the hold short line on the other side of the runway; my instructor called over the radio telling me not to take off; and that there was an emergency aircraft that would be overflying runway XX to circle to runway XY. Shortly after that; the airplane overflew runway XX. I then taxied over to the runup/hold short area of runway XY at Taxiway 2. From there I saw the emergency aircraft circle back around for landing. When they touched down on the runway; the airplane rolled down the runway for a moment then its right landing gear collapsed causing the right wing and nose to hit the ground. The airplane then started sliding on the ground and slid off the right side of the runway after the intersection. From there; I shut down [my aircraft]; engaged the parking brake; and ran over to the crashed airplane to make sure everyone was ok. One of the employees of the airport had also driven over there as well.After confirming that everyone was alright; I went back to [my aircraft] and got on the radio and called the UNICOM for instructions. I was told to taxi back the way I had come and park the airplane. I then started the plane up; announced that I was taxing back to the ramp; and began taxing. Once I got to the hold short line for runway XX; I checked for traffic and then announced that I was crossing the runway at Taxiway 1. Once I was clear of runway XX; I announced that I was clear and taxing the plane back to the ramp for parking.

I heard Ground Control tell Aircraft X 'Runway XX left at Taxiway X; Tower for the back-taxi'. I was working Local Control and saw an Aircraft Y on the northwest ramp begin to taxi. I then began to scan the north end of Runway XXL and looked along its length to the south end as I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff. 'Aircraft Y; left turn on course; Runway XX left at Taxiway Y cleared for takeoff; traffic two mile final.' Aircraft Y read back the entire transmission and then began to taxi forward past the hold line. I was then looking further to the south for any other aircraft that I might have missed on a base turn or short final. Seeing none; I turned to the STARS display to see my inbound traffic; check my sequences and see if there were any traffic conflicts. Seeing none; I turned back to the north to scan my runway again. At this point; I see Aircraft X *ON* Runway XXL taxiing southbound at a good rate of speed opposite direction and had just started to slow and turn to exit the runway at Intersection Z.I yelled to Ground Control 'That guy is on my runway!' I then tried to call Aircraft X on my frequencies but got no response. At this point; Aircraft X was crossing the hold line on Taxiway Z off the runway and Aircraft Y was on departure roll. I determined that it would do more harm than good to stop Aircraft Y departure so I let them continue. I tried to call Aircraft X again and he responded saying 'We heard you clear that other guy so we exited the runway here at Taxiway Z.'I told him that Ground Control had wanted them to CONTACT me for back-taxi; not to back-taxi and monitor my frequency. I then instructed Aircraft X to contact Ground Control on frequency again. I'm not sure if Ground Control gave Aircraft X a warning or not. I had other traffic that demanded my attention. If the Ground Controller had used proper/standard phraseology; I believe that Aircraft X would not have crossed the hold line for Runway XXL and would instead have called me on the frequency.

This is the information about the flight as submitted on the airspace authorization and forwarded to Airport Director/Tower Manager:A radius of 1 NM about the following coordinates at or below 400 ft. AGL: Latitude XX; Longitude YY. The Aviation Division has been tasked by the State's commission to collect video and photographs of the selected site. The Airport Director; Person A; has agreed to operations at or below 400 ft. AGL in the proximity of the above location. The requested five day window is Day 0 - Day 4. This window is to allow for optimal weather. The authorization system rejected submittal for multiple days. The following error appeared in the form:  'Date of Operation must be a single day for a LAANC enabled airport.' Operations will be conducted in the presence of the Airport Director and in coordination with the ATC Director. In order to maintain an appropriate level of safety; the remote pilot in command (RPIC) holds both a remote pilot certificate and a private pilot certificate. Two or more visual observers (VO) will be utilized to increase situational awareness and safety of operation. The operation will be conducted during visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The RPIC will give way to all manned aircraft. The operation will occur one day within the five day window and will last approximately three hours beginning at approximately XA:00 CDT.The incident occurred in Area C; a 0.2 NM circle centered on Latitude ZZ ; Longitude AA as depicted on FAA Authorization XXXX-XXX-XXXX ZZZ Airport. As required by the authorization I notified tower by phone call that I would be taking off in ten minutes at Area C and that the flight would last 10-15 minutes. I activated the custom DJI Flysafe zone and was operating for about 10 minutes when tower cleared a helicopter to take off from taxiway A with the instructions to remain east of the field. My VO informed me to land the drone when the helicopter pointed directly east. I deconflicted by descending and maneuvering southwards towards the home point and when the drone had descended to about 300 ft. AGL the helicopter banked sharply left to deconflict. I landed the drone after the encounter. The helicopter informed the tower afterwards that a drone was operating to the east of the field. It is of my opinion that the tower should have advised the helicopter that a UAS was operating prior to giving instructions to transit the authorized area in which I was operating. When we moved to Area A north of the field; the tower began advising pilots as he should have done prior to our incident in Area C. Also; I should have landed the drone more quickly rather than wait to make visual contact with the helicopter. I had immediately questioned the tower's reasoning behind clearing the helicopter without advising of our operation; however I expected that the helicopter to maintain a south heading east of the field and then transition to an east flight path as opposed to his immediate transition to an east flight path; and therefore did not land immediately.

During takeoff; we had both master cautions come on with all lights illuminated on the Captain's and First Officers six packs. I rejected the takeoff because I thought it was the safest thing to do. Never before have I ever seen all lights illuminated on the Captain's and First Officer's six packs during takeoff. I would do the same things based on the indications we had on takeoff.

For me this event occurred one my 3rd leg of the day on day 5 of 6.  For this flight; we were originally supposed to have Aircraft Y.  When we got to the aircraft Maintenance was onboard investigating an open write up that previous crews had reported; fumes of unknown origin.  Maintenance couldn't find the issue and we were assigned a new plane. We arrived to Aircraft X and soon departed.  On climb out just after rotation; the captain and I noticed a smell but we both thought it was from the [prior aircraft] that took off prior to us. The smell went away quickly.Just before beginning the descent I had started to develop a slight headache. Upon starting descent a few moments later; we both started to smell the smell again.   At this time the Captain said he had a headache and I responded that I had one as well.  He then said he wanted to try something and gave me the radios (I was Pilot Flying and he was Pilot Monitoring) and donned the O2 mask for a couple of breaths. Then put his headset on and asked me to do the same.  I took a couple of breaths from the mask and instantly felt better. I realized at that time we were definitely experiencing fumes of some unknown origin in the flight deck and that it wasn't us just being paranoid because of the fact that our original plane we were supposed to fly had this exact issue written up.  I took my mask off and could really smell the fumes.  I told the Captain I instantly felt better on the O2 and I can really smell the fumes now.The Captain immediately called for Smoke/Fire/Fumes QRC.  At this time we were already descending on the STAR into our destination (maybe 15 min out).  Captain took over the aircraft and radios while I ran the QRC then QRH.  We started the QRH and requested special handling with ATC.  The Captain called the FAs (Flight Attendants) and informed them of the situation and they could not smell any fumes in the cabin.  We asked ATC to notify our Dispatch for us.  We continued on with the QRH and stopped the QRH when we got to 'RAT Manual Deploy Lever ........ PULL'.  We agreed to stop the QRH as we were less then 10min out from landing and did not want to put ourselves in an electrical emergency situation. Shortly after; we entered icing conditions and 'ICE CONDITION' along with 'STALL PROT ICE SPEEDS' appeared on EICAS. After loading ice speeds in we got a master caution for 'A-I WING FAIL'. After identify/cancel; Captain called for A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We then realized the bleeds were out from the SMOKE/FIRE/FUMES QRH and stopped the A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We broke out of the clouds about 5 seconds later and landed safely within a couple of minutes.  We were met on the ground by Crash Fire Rescue and notified them that we did not need any assistance and were good to continue to the gate.

Boarded the aircraft and the crew immediately smelled the dirty socks/locker room smell. Was told it would decimate...but it got progressively worse and Flight Attendants suffered from headaches; irritation of eyes and scratchy throat. One of the F/As (Flight Attendants) got dizzy and almost passed out.

On taxi out we were cleared to spot X.  Approaching the spot the F/O (First Officer) contacted ZZZ ground and we were given the clearance to taxi to XYR via Taxiway 1 and Taxiway 2 with clearance to cross [the crossing runway].  Still approaching spot X and Taxiway 1 both the F/O and myself noticed a VERY FAST TAXING 737 approaching from the gate ramp area heading directly towards Taxiway 1 instead of spot Y or Z that would have been assigned by ramp control. The F/O then made the comment 'I don't think he is going to stop!' to which I replied 'I don't think he is either!' Then to avoid a collision; I started breaking; HARD! Then we hear the 737 call ZZZ ground for clearance to which ground replies; '[callsign] follow the Airbus on your right......unless your going to cut him off....which I see you already have...well.... I guess go ahead and go first.....taxi to XYR via Taxiway 1 and Taxiway 2 cross [the crossing runway]. Aircraft Y replies with a disingenuous 'sorry'.In my opinion and observations the Captain of Aircraft Y was taxing aggressively; recklessly; and carelessly to intentionally 'beat us' to Taxiway 1. He didn't have clearance from ground; never slowed down; and made no effort to take ownership of his mistake. Aircraft Y was on their last leg of their trip and was obviously 'pushing' to get home to their base. I waited a day to sleep on the events before reaching out to the ZZZ1 Chief Pilots office on how to proceed. His recommendation was to go through professional standards first; which I did. The results were not encouraging or corrective from the offending Captain. He didn't take ownership of his dangerous actions or feel he did anything wrong even in light of ground admonishing him for cutting us off and his FO responding with 'sorry'. Professional standards described the Captain as 'difficult'. Had this Captain made a poor judgment mistake in his rush to 'beat us in getting home' and showed remorse either at the time of the incident or later when contacted by professional standards; I would have let this go hopefully knowing that this Captain wouldn't do it again to someone else. Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case. I strongly believe this Captain needs to be disciplined on the safe operation of the aircraft and not play 'chicken with jets' on the ramp creating collision hazards.

Aircraft Y; a gyrocopter in the pattern at ZZZ utilized lower altitude to take advantage of right of way rules cutting off 2 aircraft in the pattern. Aircraft Y made a crosswind call in front of other traffic on the departure leg. During final approach in the pattern Aircraft Y laterally displaced themself right of the centerline; and proceeded back across the centerline in front of my aircraft causing a near mid air collision.

During cruise flight at FL350; FLT CTRL SYS B became inoperative. We completed QRH procedures which directed us to place the FLT CTRL B switch to RUD STBY. This also created additional failures in Diff Feel and Yaw Damper Fail. We also noticed that 'A' system hydraulic fluid appeared to be decreasing. Since we were not yet halfway and about to go on a portion of our trip completely over water for approximately 500 miles; we elected to turn around to divert back to ZZZ. We considered diverting 300 miles to ZZZ1 and looked at other potential diversion points on the return to ZZZ. We were going to be approximately 2;000 pounds overweight; so we [requested priority handling] in accordance with the FOM and company policy. During the approach the flight controls were sluggish. The approach and landing were completed per the 737 QRH Overweight Landing Checklist; and an overweight landing entry made in addition to the SYS B Failure in the a/c logbook.Suggestions - I think the 737 QRH needs to be reviewed for additional steps on this item. Very brief. Doesn't mention that follow on failures will occur including loss of Yaw Damper and Feel Diff. Additionally there is no information in QRH Overweight Landing Checklist that indicates[requesting priority handling] is required per company policy.

Uneventful until arriving to Company ramp at PWM. Approaching Gate X; silhouette was clear with Marshaler wands up. We observed what appeared to be slush in the silhouette; as a result I taxied approximately 5 knots; slow; steady cautious. The gate has a down slope toward the parking position.  With approximately 30 feet to go; I began braking to further slow. As I applied the brakes; there appeared to be no change in acceleration; I continued to steadily increase brake pressure as it appeared the aircraft appeared to accelerate. With full brake pressure applied; within approximately 10 feet of the planned stopping position; and no indication the aircraft was stopping; I extended the Thrust Reverses; (TR's) Passing the expected stop position; I began applying reverse thrust; however; it was at this point; the aircraft began to decelerate to a stop. It turns out the Reverse thrust never went above reverse idle; before stopping. After stopping; the tug was connected to reposition the aircraft. Debriefing the Maintenance Personnel who was also the Marshaler; he observed the main gear began sliding side-ways during the approach to stop. No damaged was noted by aircrew or maintenance; nor were any flight manual limits exceeded; but all parties acknowledged it was a very close call. The Maintenance Personnel said he requested salt and sand support from the airfield prior to our arrival; but was denied. It seemed PWM was aware of the ice fouling the ramp; which was under the water and slush observed on the surface. Failure to notify aircrew of the hazard is a cause. However; had the airport authority properly treated the ramp and taxiway area; the hazard would have been abated entirely.If ice is known to foul the parking spot; send a note during the in-range ACARS message to expect a tow in. If that window of opportunity is missed; drive the tug out and give marshaling directions to set brakes and shutdown. Of course; having the parking area properly treated would have solved most of the problems.

While descending on the STAR; the EICAS warning message 'LAV SMOKE' illuminated. I could hear the forward lavatory smoke alarm activating. We initiated the LAV SMOKE QRH and called the Flight Attendants to assess the forward lavatory. The Flight Attendant reported no observed smoke. I asked her to verify that the trash can was not smoking and check all around the LAV to confirm there were no remnants of a cigarette. No apparent source for smoke was found and no smoke was directly observed. My initial judgment based on this was that the LAV SMOKE alarm was false. I had the Flight Attendants check a second time and cross check each other that there was no smoke in the lavatory. The First Officer and I elected to continue to ZZZ. Shortly after; the Flight Attendant called back and said that she was smelling an unusual smell (which she later described as an 'oily smell') emanating from or around the lavatory. I asked her if the other Flight Attendant on board smelled this also; and she stated she did. The forward lavatory smoke alarm was still active when I received this call. They stated no smoke was visible; but were clearly concerned about the smell. I did smell a faint odor from the flight deck at this point but cannot accurately pinpoint it. Based on this information; given I now had two separate sources indicating a potential problem; I consulted with the First Officer about options and elected to divert to ZZZ1; which we were nearly right over at this time. Preparations for landing then consumed all of our energy and we did not troubleshoot the LAV SMOKE indication further. We executed a normal landing and taxi to the gate. ATC rolled the trucks for us. In hindsight; there were two additional things I would have done. First; the First Officer and I never donned oxygen. The preparation for landing occurred quickly and my priority was to get on the ground to troubleshoot the combo of LAV SMOKE indication and figure out what the Flight Attendants were smelling. When I switched to 'divert' mindset; putting on oxygen would have been a smart move to ensure the pilots would be protected if fumes intensified. Also; I would have more clearly said we were requesting priority handling. Since I did not clearly say this; the First Officer was confused for a moment exactly what he should say to ATC about our decision to divert.

Descending from 10;000 to 6;000; ATC instructed us to slow to 210 kt. The Captain selected LVL CHG and tried to set the speed with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP (Mode Control Panel). He then noted that the airspeed would not change with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP. All three airspeed indicators matched so we knew it was not airspeed unreliable. We tried different vertical modes and turned the autothrottle off and back on and still could not change the speed with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP. We finally decided to [request priority handling] as a precaution and turned off the autopilot and autothrottles and continued the approach. We landed without incident. At touchdown the MCP speed indicated 193 kt. but aircraft speed was at VREF+5. [I suggest to] maintain aircraft.

During post flight an area was discovered on right wing that appeared to have indicated we hit something airborne. The area does not look like we hit something organic; there is evidence of a heat signature and the fairing has exposed composite. We never saw anything however I am wondering if we grazed a drone. The aircraft static wicks are all intact and we never encountered any weather. I do not believe this to be a lightning strike.

During preflight planning; I read the valid Maintenance Release and saw a write up that was worthy of further review. The write up was a cleared write up that is normally seen as an auto-generated write up associated with MEL XX (A Hydraulic system quantity indication - flight deck). However; there were no MELs on the Maintenance Release. I called Maintenance Crew for a consult. He explained to me that the write up was cleared simultaneously with the MEL. The primary argument was the fact that the MEL was not on the Maintenance Release and it was a valid Maintenance Release. Additionally; the A hydraulic system was indicating normal. Based on those two facts; I accepted the aircraft. After arriving in ZZZ; I checked hydraulic system A. It was not indicating normal (RF 65%). Additionally; the auto generated write up appeared again breaking the Maintenance Release. I called ZZZ MX (Maintenance) they said the MEL was cleared improperly in ZZZ1. I am not sure what that means. But it seems to me it is likely that the Hydraulic system level was checked IAW MEL XX. But the MEL was signed off as cleared instead of complied with.

Mission: Local IFR for multiple practice approaches at ZZZ. 2 persons aboard; PIC and safety pilot/instructor CFII. Aircraft went through a comprehensive proper pre-flight inspection. Engine start and checklists were completed and were normal. Engine run-up to include magneto checks and prop governor check were satisfactory. All engine instruments were indicating 'Green'; i.e. normal readings. take-off run was normal and all engine instruments/indications were normal. Full-power take-off was normal. At 700 ft. power was adjusted for climb power setting when engine roughness was noticed. There was no reading of the #2 EGT during climb out. Tower switched to Approach control and Approach Control issued a new heading to 240. As the aircraft turned left from 330 to 240 engine roughness increased and continued to increase violently. [Priority handling was requested] and aircraft was cleared to land on Runway XX. Aircraft landed uneventfully on the Runway. Upon exiting the Runway on the next available Taxiway the engine quit. Speculation; water-ice in the fuel tank. Temps were extremely cold. Aircraft was topped off with fuel 8 days prior. The aircraft was stored in a heated hangar. Possible solution; extraordinary care should be taken to drain adequate fuel from the tanks when weather condition are conducive for moisture/water/ice in fuel tanks.

I was in a climb about 10 miles north of ZZZ to 11;500 as the air was cold and my C172 was climbing well when I felt like a sudden loss of engine power. The RPMS kept dropping and rising as I pumped the throttle. I immediately felt like I was losing my engine and requested priority handling with ATC. They started vectoring me towards the airport for an immediate landing. After about 3-4 minutes ATC suggested I pull the carburetor heat; which fixed the issue. I did have to keep the carb heat in for 6-7 minutes to fully melt the carb ice in the carb. Once I felt the situation was back under control I canceled the request for priority handling and continued to my destination at 9;500 feet back to ZZZ1.

I was Pilot Monitoring. On the ILS 12 the auto pilot disengaged with a red warning message at around 3000 ft. while capturing the glide slope. The Pilot Flying re-engaged the autopilot; and the airplane continued on the ILS. The airplane was struggling to slow down as flaps and speed brakes were applied. Around 2000 ft.; we noticed a yellow caution auto pilot message with no aural. At the same time the plane pitched forward below the glide slope. The Pilot Flying disengaged the autopilot to re intercept the glide slope. It was at this time; around 1800 ft.; that the Tower reported a low altitude report to us. We told them we were correcting. The Pilot Flying re captured the glide slope and continued hand flying down to the runway without further incident. Failure to respond quickly enough to the autopilots deviation on the glide slope. Be more vigilant of the glide slope/localizer deviations while auto pilot is engaged.

On the 4th leg of the day and short overnight due to getting in 2 hrs late the night before. Leaving ZZZ1 to ZZZ; the weather was clear and planning for a Visual; but backing it up with an approach per the company night visual policy. We choose the RNAV XX due to wanting something other than the ILS and not having flown the RNAV XX other than in the simulator. Once airborne and talking to Center we got slowed to slowest possible speed due to a MedEvac ahead of us on an approach to ZZZ. The MedEvac canceled IFR and allowed us to get cleared for the RNAV XX. We briefed it up as a visual backed up by the RNAV so I did not brief the notes on the approach. Flying the approach when turning final; I notice the PAPI was showing 4 red and thought that odd. I prepared to disconnect Autopilot and climb to the Visual Glide Path; but wanted to see what the approach was doing. Due to being close to the airport and seeing the ridge prior to the airport; I did not want to look at the notes to see if there was a note about the VGSI not coincident. About 200 feet above minimums the GPWS gave a Terrain Terrain warning. I promptly disconnected the Autopilot and climbed to follow the VGSI. We landed safely and checked the altitude to see if our altimeter was set incorrectly. That checked within 10 feet. During the taxi to the ramp; I noticed the cold weather temp comp was required for temps less than -7 deg. When stated; the Captain said something like that should't be the factor; then he looked at the DATA card which was on his yoke; and noticed that the temp was -13 degrees. Captain commented that the cold temp would probably account for the couple hundred feet low on the approach. Lessons learned brief notes when we probably will be flying an approach that ATC clears us for. Try to incorporate Temp Comp which is currently not allowed with any FMS approach even for visual approaches.

Encountered wake turbulence on the RYDRR2 arrival LAX from a B777. Took evasive actions routing and descent path.  I could not stabilize our approach to 24R due to residual wake and made a go around/missed approach. Returned for approach 25L and made a normal approach and landing. Red eye flight. In a very stable air mass. Wake turbulence was severe enough to change headings and descent paths for avoiding injury and aircraft damage.

Our aircraft was on the take-off roll. A contractor's truck approached the runway without making a radio call. We aborted take-off; the truck stopped prior to the hold short line; and sufficient runway was remaining; so we continued the take-off roll as it appeared the truck was holding. After we restarted take-off roll the truck then approached the runway and entered the runway environment again made no radio call. Our aircraft took evasive action by lifting off as soon as safely possible; the truck was well past the hold short line and estimated 50 ft. from our left wing tip during evasive action.

Hour and a half out of ZZZ get an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) that comes and immediately goes away. What was that? Then it came back for a little longer: HYD G RSVR LO LVL. And quickly goes away. HYD system page shows low green quantity; just above the amber range. ECAM comes back and stays on. Run ECAM actions; QRH; discuss our understanding together; talk with Dispatch and MX (Maintenance) Control; inform ATC of situation; requesting special handing by ZZZ Tower due to no nose wheel steering after landing; brief inflight and customers. Inflight code yellow; as normal landing expected; except for stopping on runway; and tug to gate. Landed uneventfully on Runway XXL. Super tug to gate; ZZZ MX noted large amounts of hydraulic fluid in gear bay.

On final approach into ZZZ to runway; Captain called for Landing Gear down and Flaps 15." Flaps ceased to move beyond flaps 10 degrees. We elected to go around and requested vectors to run the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) and opted not to accept holding instructions due to the fact that the autopilot would not engage. Ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree and continued to be vectored southwest of the field until ready for approach on the long Runway (XX). Captain elected to [request priority handling] and I agreed. Insufficient time to notify Dispatch.  very busy right seat due to no autopilot. Captain flew the aircraft and got the radios. Non-normal performance data was loaded and we continued the approach following QRH guidelines. There was some discussion about the speeds; but in the end it was agreed that the speeds were correct. Flaps were extended to 15 using alternate flap extension procedure. QRH finished to completion prior to landing. I notified Flight Attendants of the malfunction and Passengers subsequently as well during the vectoring. Flight Attendants were very professional and informative. Asked Tower to roll the trucks just in case. Landing was uneventful. We taxied off the runway and had trucks conduct visual inspection of the aircraft. After that; and brake cooling calculation; we decided it was safe to taxi to the gate. Passengers and In-flight Crew were very positive after opening the cockpit door. I think I heard applause from the back during landing roll-out.After speaking with the Captain one day after this event; he said he had called the Company to discuss further in depth regarding the failure.  At the time of the event it was impossible to ascertain what caused the flaps to cease normal operation.  Captain subsequently described his conversation with Maintenance and explained that they stated two of the flap transmissions had seized. This in turn prevented autopilot engagement.  Perhaps that is why we always hand fly no flap or reduced flap approaches during training?  I am not sure how we could have prevented the flaps from seizing. It's becoming clear to me that the fleet is aging as more and more mechanical issues crop up."

This was my first solo flight and my original intention was to do three full-stop taxi-backs. I landed on [Runway] XXR and exited the runway via [Taxiway] XX and then taxied back to Runway XXR via [Taxiway] XY. I did not perform the after-landing checklist and the carburetor heat was left on and flaps were left at 30 degrees. ATC provided clearance to takeoff on [Runway] XXR and fly straight out. I started to take off with carb heat on and flaps at 30 degrees and did not note this error until I observed that the plane was not accelerating normally and was beginning to lift off the ground around 40 kt. when rotate speed is 55 kt. I put the throttle to idle but was not able to maintain directional control and the aircraft veered off of the runway into the grass between Runway XXR and XXL. I was able to brake the plane to a full stop in the grass and then taxied back onto Runway XXR and requested that the flight be terminated and taxi back to parking. This experience emphasized the importance of the after-landing checklist so that all procedures are followed to ensure safety.

Aircraft X was issued 1;700 ft. in a 1;700 ft. MVA. The aircraft was direct ZZZ requesting a visual approach. I stated that 1;700 ft. was the lowest altitude I was going to be able to give him and to have him a position report of the airport and instructed him to report the field in sight. The pilot said 'Roger'. I observed the aircraft descending and issued a low altitude alert with the appropriate phraseology; stating what the MVA was in the area and to ensure that he was at an altitude of 1;700 ft. The lowest I observed was 1;300 ft. about 10 northwest of the airport. He responded by climbing and saying roger; adding that he was VFR in the rain. He then came back shortly after and said he would like vectors for the GPS approach into ZZZ and that the Tower was advertising a ceiling of 5;000 ft. but he could see the field. I responded by issuing a climb to 2;000ft. and a vector to the final approach course.In my opinion; this was strictly a pilot error. I should have been clued in to watch him like a hawk even more so because on check in from ZZZ1 Approach; he checked in saying he was turning direct ZZZ (not the flight plan given by ZZZ1) to avoid weather; which a pilot can't just do without requesting a course deviation first. I just immediately responded 'cleared direct ZZZ' to alleviate any issues on both ends. The initial check in was also missing his assigned altitude which is required by the AIM. There were a couple of what I thought to be slight course deviations when he was nearing the airport (again without asking) but as the plane was at 020 at the time and no other airplanes around; and the deviations weren't that noticeable; I didn't take issue with it. When I issued 1;700 ft.; I thought me saying 'that's going to the LOWEST I can get you... report the field in sight' that that would have been an extra heads up to the pilot that he can't descend any further.

On approach to ZZZZ airport ATC instructed us to Maintain 300 Knots. ATC further instructed us to slow to 250 Knots. After slowing to 250 Knots and just after the chime below 10;000 I receive a call from [Flight Attendant name 1]; informing me of a strong odor I the back of the aircraft. I informed her that we were flying direct to the airport and the safest option was to proceed to the airport and that we would be landing inappropriately 10 minutes. After landing we called the cabin to ascertain the situation.  We were told that the odor had dissipated; so we proceeded to the gate.  After the passengers disembarked; I talked directly to [Flight Attendant 2] who first reported the event. She informed me of a strong odor in the back of the aircraft that caused her minor eye irritation. No other passengers or dead heading crew reported an odor; so it was likely limited to the aft section of the aircraft.

Aircraft had MEL 34-XX-X and MEL 34-XX-Y. ATL was conducting ILS Runway 26R. I was flying had nav1 signal for LOC 1 with IGXZ on PDF. The LOC became intermittent working and red flag in VMC conditions. Corrected each time but was vectored around for another approach. During this apprise the FO (First Officer) NAV 2 LOC was working. Briefed the changes due to FO will be flying now. When cleared for approach the Flight Director failed and came back. Still VMC and then the FO nav 2 loc 2 went red with red loc flag; which went back to green. Told ATC again there was a problem. Low on fuel we diverted to ZZZ. Discussed with Dispatch. Landed with 1;600 lbs. ATL Approach was very helpful and understanding. Loss of reliability with navigation NAV 1 and NAV 2.

I was working DSide 88/97 on the 97 scope. The low sector; 98 was split off due to traffic saturation. Thunderstorms had kept the 97 and 88 sector busy all day. 98 Rside attempted to call over the line but ended up hanging up and verbally coordinating an unrestricted climb into ZZZ1 up to 41000 ft. 97 Rside told 98 Rside about traffic at 31000 ft. and 35000 ft. 98 Rside acknowledged traffic. Shortly after; the ZZZ1 airspace was turned on. Shortly after that the Aircraft X flight became airborne and we got the automated tag. Under the assumption Aircraft X was only climbing to 29000 ft. because it was Non-RVSM; 97 Rside accepted a point out of Aircraft X and flashed the data block back. We both observed Aircraft X flight's data block climbing quickly. At least 5000 FPM. Again; we assumed Aircraft X would be stopping at 29000 ft. so Rside did not call traffic for Aircraft Y at 31000 ft. Aircraft X data block jumped from 290 to 299 and simultaneously Aircraft Y reported it was responding to an RA due to traffic less than 100 ft. beneath them off of their left side. Aircraft X flight was not inside the ZZZ1 airspace yet so the Non RVSM was absolutely a factor. 98 Rside admitted to releasing Aircraft X unrestricted to FL300 and did not realize the Non RVSM. I'm not sure what altitude the Aircraft X stopped its ascent. I think most of the time this isn't an issue. I believe it was mainly 98 Rside not realizing or overlooking the non RVSM of Aircraft X. If there were any procedures to be changed it would be to only allow unrestricted climbs to the top of each sector and coordinate once the aircraft is airborne. However; again; I think the climbs into the ZZZ1 areas are usually fine and this particular incident was on the Controller.
