During landing; gusting wind caused aircraft to drift off Runway during early phase of landing; so initiated a go-around. During go around; aircraft left wheel pant contacted Runway edge light; damaging light and wheel pant. Pilot's low recent hours in aircraft and landing in gusty winds were main cause of accident. More recent experience with landings; especially in windy conditions would have led to greater proficiency in such and likely would have prevented the [incident]. Continuing to a different airport with more favorable winds also would have been an option that could have prevented the [incident].

After departing ZZZ while climbing through FL220 the R Eng Pylon Overheat CAS message illuminated. I called for the QRH and asked to level at 240 which Center immediately cleared me to do. As part of the checklist we reduced the affected engine to idle and the CAS went out. We elected to return to ZZZ. During descent the CAS message come on so per the QRH we shut down the right engine and informed ATC. We completed the shutdown and single engine checklists and landed. We stopped on a high speed turnoff; shutdown and evacuated the passenger. We along with the emergency crew inspected the aircraft and found no evidence of fire or heat damage. The passengers were given a ride to the FBO by the emergency crew while we taxied the aircraft to the FBO on the other engine. Not much to say other than we did what we were trained to do and it worked out well.

After landing at ZZZ following a flight from ZZZ1; I departed behind a small Cessna; I believe a C-150 or C-152. I climbed out at 90 mph indicated as the instructors have trained us which is Vx. I do not recall hearing radio calls from the Cessna. My aircraft has a very long nose making forward visibility very limited at a 10 degree or higher deck angle to achieve 90 mph indicated airspeed. With that configuration; I could not see the Cessna in front of me. As I turned right cross-wind; the Cessna suddenly appeared above me and to my left. I flew beneath the Cessna and crossed under his flight path and departed the traffic pattern to the South. The Instructor in the Cessna asked if I had the Cessna in sight. I said that I did. He said they had been making radio calls. I said I did not recall hearing them. Analysis: We are trained to climb at Vx. With the long nose of the modified SNJ-4; I lost sight of the Cessna. In the future; I will need to periodically lower the nose to view traffic in front of me during climbout.

Descending on the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ through approximately 9000 ft.; in VMC we encountered moderate turbulence for approximately 2-4 seconds. The aircraft banked to the right and we received a roll authority alert. As quickly as we started to manage the turbulence; the encounter had already ended. Prior to the turbulence event; we were in smooth air from the cruise phase of flight all the way through our descent. I asked the First Officer to call the flight attendants to make sure they were OK. Flight Attendant (FA) XX Stated he fell into a passenger seat and hit his arm on an overhead bin but said he was OK. The rest of the flight went smoothly without incident and after all the passengers deplaned; I debriefed the flight attendants and checked on their well being. During our debrief FA XX stated his arm was sore but thought he was alright. FA XY said she was thrown into her jump seat and that the turbulence was severe. The two remaining Flight Attendants were in the front of the aircraft and did not report being jostled or injured.

During post flight an area was discovered on right wing that appeared to have indicated we hit something airborne. The area does not look like we hit something organic; there is evidence of a heat signature and the fairing has exposed composite. We never saw anything however I am wondering if we grazed a drone. The aircraft static wicks are all intact and we never encountered any weather. I do not believe this to be a lightning strike.

Departed ZZZ; Aircraft X; to ZZZ1 on Date. Approximately 100 E/NE ZZZ2 while at FL340 at XA50Z; while deviating north for weather; the flight crew received a Master Caution and ECAM for HYD SYS LO PRSR for the Yellow Hydraulic System. Subsequently; a FLT CNTRL ECAM was received due a partial spoiler deployment (#4) on the right wing. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying and the Captain was the Pilot Monitoring. All QRC; ECAM; QRH and follow-up procedures were completed by the Pilot Monitoring. While the Pilot Flying continued the weather deviation; the Pilot Monitoring conferred with dispatch on flight options and diversion details; to include the NOTAMs for ZZZ2. A request for priority handling was made and a diversion to ZZZ2 with ATC priority radar vectors for descent. Coordination via a precautionary landing brief to the flight attendants and passenger PA were also completed. Additional information regarding the partial spoiler deployment was obtained via communication between the Pilot Monitoring and the number one Flight Attendant via a visual inspection of the right wing. There was a noticeable right wing dip at altitude and increased buffet and droop during the descent and approach phase of flight. The Pilot Flying executed a visual approach; with the electronic means of backup using the ILS XXR to an underweight landing (132;000 pounds). After clearing the Runway; an Airport Rescue and Firefighting vision inspection was executed; with the crew confirming flight crew suspicions of hydraulic fluid loss along the belly of the aircraft. With the Green; Blue hydraulic systems intact; the aircraft was taxied to Gate XX. Cause was determined to be the mechanical failure of Yellow System Reservoir. ECAM status page mentions approach phase procedures which result in return of HYD SYS LO PRSR ECAM warning (engine pump on) which can confuse with electric pump on since both work with Yellow System.

On final approach to XXL in ZZZZ; out of 5;000 ft. and cleared for the approach; the first officer armed the approach mode. Once armed; we received multiple EICAS messages (3 pages) of system failures. I lost background lighting and multiple instruments. I looked up at the electrical panel and noted the STBY PWR OFF Light illuminated. After requesting priority handling; I handed the Paper QRH to the International Relief Officer and instructed her to read the Standby Power Off checklist. We complied with the checklist and continued the approach to an uneventful landing.On rollout; I took control of the aircraft; and through 100 kts.; felt the airplane being sluggish. I stated I thought we had blown tires; as our inboard tires had no anti-skid protection. We cleared the runway; and noted the break temp monitors were at 9 on my outboard brakes. I called Tower to ensure services were enroute; and wanted them to focus on our main landing gear in case of fire. Once ensured there was no fire; I contacted Ops; Dispatch; Maintenance Control to make everyone aware of our situation. After approximately 30 minutes I was informed that all 8 main tires were flat. Air stairs were brought to the aircraft; and all passengers and crew egressed with no injuries. We were taken by bus to the main terminal.Before leaving the aircraft; an ELB write up was accomplished. Upon further investigation of the logbook's history; I see there was a similar write up of a 'hard power transfer' when the approach mode was selected with multiple EICAS messages. In their case; they never lost STBY PWR; as in mine. Seems there was an electric anomaly with this jet that was never found by Maintenance. In my opinion; the paper QRH should not be removed from our aircraft; as it was the fastest means for us to accomplish a lengthy checklist before landing; as this problem presented itself at a very inopportune moment on approach.This is an addendum to a previous report. It was brought to my attention after landing that the speed brakes failed to deploy; and the crew missed that fact with all our attention focused on failed systems; checklists; and flying the airplane. Upon landing my focus was squarely on keeping the airplane tracking the runway center line. In the end; with the length of runway; I do not believe the speed brakes were a factor in the final outcome of the flight.

Fuel starvation caused by a multitude of events. Left tank seemed to have a leak during preflight- made sure the sump was tightened to prevent any further issue. Likely took off on the left tank (~17 gallons) while right tank was full (25 gallons). Student was near checkride ready; so it was more of an observation flight as a CFI. Student was not paying attention when the GPS message popped up every 30 minutes to change tanks. We did burn off the right tank for 30 minutes; but the rest had to have been on the left tank. I noticed the message as we were around 5 miles out from the ZZZ and decided to let him finish his approach in and point it out after landing and getting ready for a few trips in the traffic pattern. We ended up going around once because he didn't like his approach. The second trip around we had an extended pattern and good separation between the aircraft we were following. They ended up taking a further exit off the Runway which forced another go around. I thought the engine coughed because the Student slammed full power in after missing the go around call from Tower; so I took the radio call and told him he was told to go around. We get up maybe around 700 AGL when the engine starts coughing more and my only immediate response was fuel pump on until I realized we just need to land safely. The go around was from 27R; we requested priority handling and landed on 09R. We got down safely and the engine was fully dead when we attempted to turn off the Runway. The fuel pump made loud and unusual noises; so I decided not to attempt a further restart. I think the shock of what just happened set in so I decided to get a tug back to the Ramp. For future lessons; I will ensure students verbally say which tank they change to and verify the fullest tank. I will also be watching even more closely for the GPS messages to change tanks - I had seen them; but the student had not. It will be drilled into their heads.

The Hot Spot at Syracuse at the intersection of Taxiway M and [Taxiway] A has documented no less than 8 runway incursions since December 2017. Airline aircraft; not general aviation aircraft; account for 7 of these incursions with 1 vehicle deviation for this location. Seven of the eight incursions; 88%; occurred in VMC conditions. Syracuse does not have an ASDE-X; and has taxiway lights; runway edge lighting and wig-wag lights indicating the entrance to a runway only when lights are turned on during IMC conditions.These runway incursions are discussed at annual meetings held at the Syracuse Airport. At the very least new signage and in-pavement lighting need to be installed. Although ASDE is no longer an option; a ground based radar with lighting controls would be the best solution.

I was practicing patterns and landings on runway XX at the ZZZ airport; and on my final landing; I taxied to the end of the runway to taxi back to the ramp. There was another plane just behind me and I ended up needlessly hurrying to the taxiway; and I didn't manage to get the plane stopped in time. As I turned off the runway; I knew it would be a tight turn; but I stopped once I felt the nose slightly drop as the nosewheel rolled onto the grass. From this point; I knew I was in a bind; so I made a radio call asking for assistance and shut down the engine. From there; a line worker was able to come to help push my plane back onto the taxiway. In the future; the corrective action is to be more patient and taxi in a slower; more controlled manner. As best as I can tell; no damage was sustained to any part of the plane or area of excursion.

Winds at 9;000 ft. were out of the southwest at 125 kts. CVG weather was marginal with gusty winds out of the West. The NOTAMs for ILS27 included alternate missed approach instructions which we used to edit the FMC. We were to climb to 2;000 ft. and turn left to FLM for holding at 3;000 ft. We briefed and talked about this difference which would most likely set us up for vectors from the south of the field. We were vectored for ILS27; holding 170 kts. until the marker. Configuration was F20 gear up. I held off on gear extension until glide slope capture which put our landing flap selection close to '1;000 ft. stable' threshold. I remember thinking that we had about 600 ft. for the flaps to move into position and complete the landing checklist. The remaining items of the event seemed compressed in time. Flaps were selected 25; speed brakes armed and landing checklist complete; and speed bug set for a wind correction of 161 kts. Just prior to 1;000 ft. an amber line strike out the GS pitch FMA. Shortly after the pitch bar on the FD biased out of view and EICAS message AUTOPILOT appeared. The raw data glideslope was missing.I do not believe that the Land 3 FMA annunciation changed; or at the least we didn't get a No AUTOLAND annunciation. My initial thought was that we were in an attitude stabilizing mode as there was a Aircraft Y in position on the runway. We then got a GPWS 'glideslope' aural alert in IMC flight conditions. I called and executed an immediate Go Around. Initial Tower instructions had us fly 290 heading and climb 3;000 ft. We were then given right turn to 360 when able and climb 4;000 ft. Starting the missed approach at 1;000 ft. AGL; 2;000 ft. MSL put us close to level off at 3;000 ft. and I recognized and compensated for this by holding the power levers from going full forward. Still the high rate at which the event took place coupled with hand flying; trying to get back to a place that we could re-automate; and accomplishing the go-around procedure while communicating with ATC made for a busy flight deck environment. We were able to engage the autopilot with the aircraft trimmed for the current flight path with about 1;000 ft. before leveling at 4;000 ft. I noticed that we were approaching 4;000 ft. with too much momentum and again manually decreased the thrust lever position. It didn't seem like the autopilot was going to even attempt a level off; much different than not exceeding a 1G level off; it was not pushing over much at all. I disconnected the autopilot and decreased the thrust levers to near idle as I attempted a manual level off but we were already climbing through our assigned altitude. The PM (Pilot Monitoring) called Tower telling them that we were not able 4;000 ft. and that we were already through the altitude. Tower immediately cleared us to 5;000 ft. which was uneventful.I believe that we were probable at around 4;300 ft. before the planes flight path was beginning to descend. We cleaned the aircraft to flaps 10 and 190 kts. due to the strong winds. We discussed the possibility of 5G interference with the glide slope as it wasn't a temporary fluctuation as you would expect with an aircraft in the critical area. I briefed and we discussed what the procedure would be if we encountered the same issues with the glide slope and how we could reconfigure for an IAN (Integrated Approach Navigation) approach. The second approach was uneventful with all systems working normally. ATC reported that the preceding aircraft reported no anomalies with the glideslope.Maintenance log reported Autopilot Caution and FD Bar Bias with ILS BEAM ERROR (FCC) 'NO ACTION REQUIRED'. I needed to focus more on the aircraft during the missed approach so as to anticipate the failed level off by the automation. The missed approach was a very busy time which was compounded by ATC changing headings and altitudes verses what was expected.

Captain (CA) was Pilot Flying (PF). We flew ZZZ1 XX with no issue and landed. Taxied off XX onto Runway YY. Ground told us to take Kilo and hold short abeam gate 33. After I read this back I began my after landing flow. I noticed the L BTMS [Brake Temperature Monitor system] Indicator on the most left wheel began to skyrocket. It went from 2 to 15 to 20 and then red. It gave us Master Warning Brake Overheat. ATC cleared us to taxi to the gate; but we told them we need to stay put and run a checklist. I ran Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) then Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). The Captain directed me to call ATC and ask for the fire trucks to take a look at the brakes; as we had no other abnormal indications (the BTMS directly next to it was reading only 02 and green). An airline taxiing by told us they did not see any smoke or fire; and the fire trucks relayed the same information when they arrived. They also took the temperature of the brakes. We elected to continue to the gate. Maintenance deferred the indicator.

I was flying Aircraft X Cessna C-172N from ZZZ to ZZZ1. This was a personal flight to help maintain pilot proficiency. This is a rental aircraft from a flight school located at ZZZ. I did a full checklist-based pre-flight inspection; and normal takeoff from ZZZ. Flying my planned ZZZ1 RNAV XX approach; I proceeded to ZZZZZ; via ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ2 altitudes; and performed pre-landing checks. Had 4 white lights on the Runway XX PAPI; reduced power to lose altitude and speed. PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; I adjusted power and attitude to maintain glide slope. Checked airspeed was in the white; added first notch of flaps. Waited for aircraft to stabilize; verified PAPI showed 2 Red 2 White; checked airspeed; adjusted power; added second notch of flaps. Almost immediately after second notch of flaps there was a loud bang; an immediate turn to the right; losing altitude very quickly. I corrected the uncommanded turn as much as possible; adjusted power to maintain altitude; looked for cause of problem. I noted one flap up; one down; and went around. Gained altitude; circled; and carefully explored controllability of the aircraft; 'no change' to the flaps was best for aircraft controllability. I landed without incident. In addition to the control system failure; the aircraft apparently suffered damage to the flaps. The flight school Mechanic; and the flight school; are not communicating with me; so I do not know the extent of the damage. A careful look at GPS data shows the aircraft was operated within limits; including Vfe; at all times prior to the incident. While this flight ended with a safe landing; for me this was a very close call; and caused me a few sleepless nights processing the event. I was mentally processing the event through the evening of Date1; and did not report the control system failure as quickly as I should have. It took me a while to overcome the seriousness of the event before I started my reporting responsibilities.Not having any communication or support from the flight school added additional delay. I was hoping for more information and cooperation from the school in the reporting process; as well as resolving what happened and how to avoid this situation in the future. I regret my delay and have reviewed my reporting duties and responsibilities as pilot in command to help ensure prompt reporting as required by regulations.

I was working R24 for about an hour and a half today. All sectors around my sector were busy dealing with weather deviations and traffic routed from East coast to West coast. I did not have a D-side. During the session I had an aircraft respond to an RA descending above another aircraft. I think I violated W174. I estimate I probably had 3-4 airspace violations with Approach and surrounding sectors. This is/these are the incidents I noticed and/or remember. I did not have time to note aircraft call signs. A D-side would have helped with much of the coordination/airspace violations; but there simply was not sufficient staffing for a D-side. [I suggest] better staffing [and] better flow control.

While flying the final portion of the ZZZZZ STAR into ZZZ; we received a vector (fly current heading) prior to the final course intercept. When ATC told us to intercept final course; we were just about to fly through it. Reminded ATC that we were on a heading and not following the ZZZZZ course. They immediately gave us an intercept heading as we had just flown through final. Intercepted final. ATC gave clearance for visual approach. Aircraft was high and fast at glideslope intercept (not ATC's fault). In process of trying to slow down and capture glideslope from above; aircraft descended through glideslope and got approximately 1 dot low (autopilot had been selected off trying to capture glideslope from above). Crew recognized that we had gone low and as we were correcting; tower gave an altitude warning. Aircraft returned to glideslope and was stable at 500 ft. and landed uneventfully.

The event occurred while taxiing on the ZZZ ramp around D concourse. We were cleared by the east ramp frequency to taxi from our present position (pushed back off or EX) to spot 24X and contact the south ramp frequency. Immediately after receiving our clearance; an Aircraft X was cleared to make a right turn to spot 25X and contact Ground. Approximately a minute later; while rounding the corner from the north to south west; near spot 26 we had noted that there was an Aircraft Y that was stationary off to our right; further down the D concourse near gates D3 or D5. Shortly after passing spot 26 the Aircraft X turned out and proceeded immediately in front of us with no apparent regard for our direction of movement. Our Captain had to aggressively brake to ensure we would avoid the aircraft. Throughout this whole time; there was no communication from either the Aircraft Y; or the Ramp Controllers on involving any potential traffic conflicts on the ramp or having either us; or the Aircraft Y stop to avoid the conflict.
