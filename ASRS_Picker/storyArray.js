I was a student pilot in flight training with my flight instructor. We had intentions to do an instrument flight in the local area. We did a normal start-up and taxi. We made sure to do a brake check before taxing to Runway XX. We got clearance to taxi everything was working fine. Upon reaching Taxiway 1 I noticed that we were right of the Taxiway so I immediately applied left rudder and nothing happened. Nothing was happening; and we were speeding up to about 8-10 kts. I immediately advise my Instructor that the brakes were not working and he applies full brakes. The plane just turned right into the grass in between the taxi lights. The plane was about 6 to 10 ft. off the Taxiway. At the time our ground speed was 10 kts. My Instructor immediately advises ground that we left the Taxiway and there was no physical damage to any Taxiway lights; airport surfaces; or the plane itself. The Chief Flight Instructor was notified along with ground operations. The aircraft was taxied to maintenance where it is being diagnosed.

Inbound on the arrival planning Runway XXL. Around ZZZZZ [Intersection] we were told the airport was changing configuration and to plan on Runway XY. We set up for ILS to visual conditions and briefed as such. We were told that Tower had one more departure off of [Runway] XX; but were being given vectors to ILS Runway XY. About two miles outside of  ZZZZZ1 [Intersection]; we were told the Tower couldn't get the ILS turned around and to plan on the RNAV. At first the PM (Pilot Monitoring) selected the RNAV Z but quickly changed the box to reflect the RNAV Y; I think the PM stated it was more appropriate. The baro selector was set to the touchdown zone as we were planning for a visual. After announcing LNAV/VNAV PATH and starting down after ZZZZZ1 [Intersection]; we both said we may need to shoot the full approach as we could not see the airport. Note; after putting this approach in the box; I did quickly go over the waypoints and altitudes. I 'think' I had the PM set his baro selector to the DA for this approach. I also remember thinking I had set my selector as well. Unfortunately; I am pretty certain I changed the altimeter setting to a higher setting. I did not set my baro selector to minimums; as I thought I had. I was in the yellow at that time. While trying to focus; we heard 'Glideslope' numerous times. I almost disregarded it as I was thinking it was not on and was erroneous. This added to my confusion. I have no doubt I had tunnel vision at that time. At some point I heard the PM call out approaching minimums and simultaneously stated 'you are low' as we broke out from the overcast. I looked up to see four red on the VASI. I'm fairly sure I told him I was correcting and immediately added some power and regained two red and two white on the VASI. We did not get any terrain warnings from the GPWS or from the Tower. We landed and turned off the runway and taxied to gate. I was a bit 'spooked' about what had just happened. At the gate the PM and I discussed this event in detail and at some point saw my altimeter setting was wrong.

During cruise at FL330; the Flight Engineer brought to the Captain's attention an illuminated #3 CSD (Constant Speed Drive) Oil Pressure Low Light. The Captain elected to call company Maintenance Control to bring them into the decision-making process regarding running of checklists and possible post-flight MEL options. The Flight Engineer and Captain accomplished the associated checklist for the CSD LOW PRESS LIGHT ILLUMINATED; subsequently disconnecting the CSD. There was no further incident until the approach phase of flight nearing ZZZ1 airport. Upon the Captain's call for selection of flaps 2;" the aircraft experienced #1 and #2 engine-driven AC generators tripped; with associated under-excitation faults Systems 1 and 2; #2 Generator Breaker and #2 Generator Field lights illuminated and the #1 Generator Breaker and #1 Bus Tie Breaker lights illuminated. The Flight Engineer attempted to select the essential power source to STBY but was unsuccessful in restoring essential power using the STBY source. The Engineer attempted then to close the #1 Bus Tie Breaker; which was unsuccessful. At this time the essential power source was selected to the #1 GEN. The Captain had the First Officer [request priority handling] and diversion to ZZZ2 airport where an otherwise normal approach to landing was accomplished.[The problem was identified] upon loss of electrical power with associated loss of lights and instruments. [The cause was] unknown electrical system irregularities and malfunctions. [Responded with an] attempt to restore and protect essential power to the Captain's instruments following procedures and checklists for the related system failures. Subsequently; when it was determined normal course of procedures and checklists would not fully resolve our issues; the decision to [request priority handling] due to loss of electrical power systems and diversion to the nearest suitable airfield with ATC and ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) services."

[During] daytime VMC we performed an Auto-land Confidence check. Just after the 500 ft. call the plane nosed down toward 1;000 VSI. PF disconnected AP and landed manually. [This was possibly a] 5G issue. Auto-land was normal till 500 ft. [I suggest] more confidence checks so that we catch auto-land systems that are out of tolerances day VFR.

I was flying into ZZZ VFR but on the practice GPS 3 approach and reporting all positions into the field. I was following Aircraft Y who was also calling in all positions on CTAF. As Aircraft Y was on very short final with callouts from both him and me with our positions as 'on short final' and 'on final'; Aircraft Z the plan in question; decided to depart [unannounced] from Runway XX. By the time he made his callout Aircraft Y was forced to leave short final for a go around while I was still on my stabilized instrument approach. Upon getting my TCAS alert and then seeing the plane I took evasive action and missed hitting Aircraft Y head [on] by approximately 50-100 ft. both horizontal and vertical. Staff on the ground heard/saw on CTAF what happened and provided me with the information of the pilot in question so I could file the report.

Misinterpreted airspace conditions where flight took place. Prior to my flight I mission-planned on Airmap and mistook Class D airspace for Class G airspace. A few weeks post operations management informed me of airspace violation that took place at time of operations. Management reviewed airspace with me; the types of controlled airspace and how to better identify airspace prior to flight operations to prevent further incidents.

When I activated the cabin combustion heater in flight; a strong smell of smoke was noted in the cabin. I requested priority handling and performed the 'Electrical Smoke or Fire in Cabin During Flight' immediate action items and QRH checklist. No visible smoke was noted; and the smell quickly dissipated following completion of the checklist. I diverted to IRK and landed without further incident. No medical attention was needed; and I noted no visible damage to the aircraft.

Passing through 12;000 ft.; the FO (First Officer) and I experienced a fume event. We both noticed a musty dirty sock smell; indicative oil contamination in the ECS. I put on my oxygen mask and ran the cabin odor isolation procedure as per the manual. The smell seemed to go away after a few minutes after the 'PACK-1 OFF' step. Inflight did not smell anything in the cabin. Upon arrival; I entered the discrepancy into the Maintenance logbook; filled out the odor survey; and contacted Maintenance. After deplaning; two of the Flight Attendants agreed that the flight deck smelled very strange; but could not describe the odor. One of the two FAs  (Flight Attendants) then told me they had a metallic taste in their mouth; which is exactly what I am experiencing a day later. All required reports submitted.

On the morning of Date a private pilot and myself conducted an instrument training flight departing from ZZZ. We filed an instrument flight plan to ZZZ1 and a subsequent flight plan to ZZZ2 since reported and observed conditions provided great actual IMC training for the student. We performed a thorough pre-flight inspection in accordance with the Cessna 172R pilots operating handbook and found no discrepancies with the aircraft. Following our pre-flight we briefed our training flight; which was planned to depart ZZZ; fly the VOR-A into ZZZ1; pick up another clearance to then fly the ILS XX into ZZZ2; and fly under VFR back to ZZZ; weather permitting.   Run-up and pre-takeoff checklist items were performed and the aircraft operated normally and was properly configured for departure. The take off and climb up to cruise altitude was uneventful. Once reaching ZZZZZ (IAF/FAF for the ZZZ1 VOR-A approach) we elected to hold as published for training purposes as we were IMC. At this time we experienced two 2-3 second high pitch engine vibrations within a span of approximately 2 minutes. These vibration events were unprovoked and remedied itself. We observed the aircraft's engine gauges and attempted to replicate the issue. We could not replicate the issue and found the aircraft to be operating normally; so we decided to proceed with the flight. ZZZ Approach allowed us to change to the CTAF frequency once we were established inbound.    After conducting the approach into ZZZ1 and performing a touch and go we climbed into IMC conditions around 2;400 ft MSL. Shortly after entering IMC we observed the directional gyro precess at a rate of approximately 30 degrees within 5 minutes.  While we still had an operational magnetic compass we requested to deviate to our home airport ZZZ and end the flight. During our level off at our cruise altitude we began to experience engine vibrations and roughness. The vibrations were stronger and more prolonged than the previous ones we experienced during our flight. The engine vibrations occurred approximately 4-6 times lasting 2-4 seconds within a span of ~5 minutes. At this time we could not rely on smooth engine performance. We requested vectors to ZZZ3 and the lowest altitude in hopes to proceed in VMC. We were able to establish visual contact with the airport and were cleared the visual approach. We flew a higher and closer pattern than normal in case normal engine performance was lost. The landing was uneventful.    Following the flight I made contact with the flight schools chief mechanic and was advised to perform an engine run-up. The engine ran rough during the run-up however the magneto drop was within normal perimeters. I passed this along to the mechanic and we suspected a stuck valve. A local mechanic shop performed an engine run-up and compression test but found no anomalies. 'Av blend' oil additive was also put into the engine. The aircraft was deemed safe following their inspection and a logbook endorsement in the aircraft logbooks was entered permitting it to return to service. The reposition flight from ZZZ3 to ZZZ was uneventful and the aircraft performed normally.

We were on the ramp in ZZZ at approximately XA35z. (Engines not running). The First Officer and I just completed the supplementary procedure with respect to Deicing. We coordinated with the Deicing personnel via frequency XXX.XX. The deicing personnel was instructed by me to spray the aircraft with Type I and Type IV fluid full body. After the aircraft was sprayed the deicing personnel notified us with the time; application of fluid; brand and mixture. I called for the completion of the supplementary procedure. Approximately one minute after a fire warning appeared with a main deck cargo fire. I instructed the First Officer to take out the Cargo Fire (Main) Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) and shortly thereafter I also instructed the First Officer that an evacuation will be necessary momentarily. Time was of the essence and I said let's open the flight deck door to get moving; we saw smoke entering the cockpit. The First officer immediately closed the flight deck door. I instructed the First Officer that we will evacuate immediately through the flight deck window. The First officer opened his window and in the interest of saving time; I reached for First Officer's escape rope so that we could evacuate quicker. The First Officer exited first and when I saw he made it safely on the ground I subsequently went after. Prior to leaving; I turned the APU off. I made it safely to the ground. The Fire trucks arrived on the scene shortly thereafter. Deicing Fluid sprayed in the APU inlet door. This triggered the main deck cargo fire. Have more oversight on the outsourced vendors and perhaps have a Company employed personnel physically present to monitor the procedures that are compliant with Company. Retrain the Deicing vendors.

After takeoff we were given a series of headings to avoid helicopter traffic which we watched pass left to right. Once clear of the traffic we were climbing and turning towards ACITO the first point on our flight plan approximately 3000 [feet] we got a descent command from an RA. I immediately disconnected the autopilot; put the airplane symbol in the box and reduced power. As soon as I reached the box it went away. The PM (Pilot Monitoring) communicated with Tower [that] we had an RA. They said impossible because there was no aircraft near us. We agreed with them because neither pilot observed any nearby traffic except the helicopter which had passed us. I think we may have had 5G interference. This was a false RA I know now. But I still reacted as [if] it was real. I spoke to Maintenance about it following the flight and they agreed it sounded like the system got interference.Improve the aircraft equipment to distinguish between a false signal and a real RA signal.

While on initial climb out of SMF on the FTHIL 3 Departure; ATC cleared us to FL190 after initial contact. After passing 5000 ft. MSL; we received a TA. Shortly after (within five seconds); we received an RA telling us to descend. I disengaged the autopilot and throttles and followed the TCAS commands. My FO (First Officer) advised ATC that we were responding to a RA. Once the aircraft reversed its momentum from climb to descent; we came within 400 ft. of a VFR Cessna vertically. The Cessna was VFR at 6000 ft.-6500 ft. MSL and was not in contact with ATC. ATC never notified us or gave us any alerts to this aircraft. If the TCAS didn't alert us and give a resolution; there would [have] been a midair collision or a near midair.I don't know what the Controller was doing or if he got distracted; but he cleared us through an altitude with traffic on a direct path with our aircraft. TCAS and our training prevented an accident from occurring.

While conducting an operational flight with an optical payload; the UAS; VLOS flight; climbed through its maximum planned altitude of 390 ft AGL. The UAS took off normally; from the beach; under the full autonomous mode using Mission Planner.  At the transition altitude of 150 ft AGL; over the ocean; the aircraft accelerated into full forward flight. It became apparent the that the aircraft was climbing to an altitude that would exceed 400 ft AGL. The entire flight climb out occurred over the ocean. The pilot manipulating controls used the computer and Mission Planner to direct the aircraft back toward the beach and take off area. A pre-programmed waypoint at an altitude of 150 ft was selected and the aircraft responded. One visual observer crew member stood ready to take manual control as required. This was not required. The aircraft return to the take off point and landed. A debriefing occurred following the flight. The consensus of opinions was that since the controller laptop was operating Mission Planner for the first time it defaulted to metric. The aircrew changed the units to Imperial. The Mission Planner interface showed Imperial Units; however; the aircraft waypoints were loaded in Metric units. In the future while using Mission Planner; if the units of measure are changed then Mission Planner should be shut down after the change.  The aircraft should be powered down. Then both Mission Planner and the aircraft should be restarted. This will clear all cached data. These procedures will be added to the checklist.

Climbing out of HPN on the Westchester 7 departure from Runway 16 we lost navigation guidance from the FMS. I maintained manual control and hand flew the departure without the autopilot. The first deviation on the departure was a late turn to heading 320 which ATC queried us about. The second deviation was while leveling off at 3000 feet which was the maximum altitude on the departure. I deviated + 200 [ft.] to 3;200 feet before correcting back to 3000 feet.

When I arrived at the airport in ZZZ; I noticed that the door flap for the 1L door was protruding out quite a bit. I disarmed the one L door at the gate; and quickly did a test of my flat hand in to grab the white main handle and slightly pulled back and noticed that my hand had pinched between the main handle and the cover flap. This has been an ongoing problem and I have been told to continue reporting this. I informed the Captain and he and every crew member on board tested and had the same issue of their hands being pinched as well. Maintenance was called and arrived which resulted in a lengthy delay and which eventually I saw the entire door covering removed. We were advised that another aircraft had arrived and we would be switching gates; so when we arrived to the second aircraft the same issue applied with that lining cover for the 1L door as well. We informed maintenance and the Maintenance Staff as well had the same issue of their hands being pinched. In this case; because there was no prior damage to the molding of the door; they were able to adjust the bracket so that the lining cover sprung into place with enough allowable room for everyone to operate the main handle door properly. Every door in our entire fleet should be tested; and certified before sending into service. It is not a preflight for the Flight Attendants at this time to check that main handle door. However; it is obvious that it is a failure. I don't know why this isn't done across our fleet as serious bodily injury would result for anyone operating that door in emergency mode.

We were operating from ZZZ1-ZZZ2 on Date and had a possible altitude deviation during our descent due to an automation issue with the aircraft while on descent on the STAR. The flight was the second segment of the pairing and prior to this event we had no issues with the flight to ZZZ1 with the same aircraft. While in ZZZ1; I noticed the high forecasted winds out of the west in ZZZ2 and decided to add 10 minutes of extra fuel for any unforseen delays. After receiving our clearance we were notified of a 40 minute EDCT (estimated departure clearance time) due to the winds in ZZZ2. I made a quick phone call to Dispatch to confer and verify that the winds were the reason for the EDCT. We worked on a plan to push 10 minutes later from the gate; which would allow time for a Southeast Taxi and possible 5-10 minute delay at the end of the departure runway prior to being cleared for takeoff if everything went right. Everything did go as planned and shortly after takeoff we received an ACARS message from Dispatch alerting us to possible 20-30 minute hold times inbound to ZZZ2 due to winds. Upon reaching cruise altitude we formed a contingency plan between ourselves and also advised Dispatch of our limited hold ability. We were nearing our descent phase of the flight and as per my preflight FA (flight attendants) and PAX brief; I had briefed our FA on the ground that we would be seating them early and to have everything stowed with the FA in their jumpsuits at least 30 minutes prior to arrival. We took one final break about 50 minutes out and I reconfirmed with the FA that they were to finish up within 20 minutes and be in their jumpseats in anticipation of the reported turbulence in our descent. The rest of the flight went well till the shortly after we started our final descent.During our brief we had planned for the contingencies of what we would do if we had to land on a north runway with gusty crosswinds. My First Officer was a probationary pilot and was the flying pilot. Given he had prior experience in gusty crosswind landings in the aircraft; but was still relatively new; we agreed that if crosswinds were 30kts or greater on a North runway I would land the aircraft as that was his personal comfort level; however if they were less than that or if it was a West landing runway my FO (first officer) would land the aircraft. After briefing the approach for Runway XX; covering contingencies for multiple runways and finishing our descent checklist we started our descent into ZZZ2 on a Descend VIA the ZZZZZ RNAV landing North about 5 minutes later. We rechecked the landing data and current winds and saw that the winds were around 23 kts crosswind for Runway XXR and I asked my FO how comfortable he felt with that to which he said he was comfortable landing in those conditions. I told my FO to continue as the pilot flying in that case and I would do the runway change in the FMC. We were somewhere in the mid FL200 and started into the light to occasional moderate turbulence at this point while we were somewhere just prior to ZZZZZ; perhaps less than 5 miles ZZZZZ; when we had the automation issue with the aircraft right before I could do a runway change. We were in FMC SPD/VNAV PATH per our FMA with a bottom altitude of 11000 ft. in the altitude selector and around 280kts when suddenly the our autopilot disconnect alert came on and we found ourselves in CWS (Control Wheel Steering) and CWP (Control Wheel Panel) modes and both of our flight directors missing as we approached ZZZZZ intersection. After the initial startle factor I told my FO to hand fly the arrival while I tried to trouble shoot the issue. I believe my FO initially tried re-engaging the CMD B autopilot first when this happened; followed by my trying to re-engaging VNAV/LNAV with no luck. I then tried a quick reset of the Flight Directors (and noted the Captain side would not take the master leading me to wonder if it was a CA (captain) side FCC issue) which did not work either. During this time my FO told me he didn't know if he could make the altitude restriction at ZZZZZ as we were somewhat high so I called ATC and asked for altitude relief due to a flight computer issue. We were given the relief as well as offered any assistance such as a heading if needed. Other than being higher than planned profile due to the startle factor we seemed to have everything under control so I advised ATC we would let him know if we needed further assistance but okay for now. At this point I told my FO I was going to check the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) real quick too see if I could find a quick solution only to quickly remember my iPad was at less than 15% (while in dark mode and remaining off most of the flight) due to the fact that the aircraft had no USB charging port and that the only power charging station was behind my FO head. I had been charging my iPad during our 50 minute turn and during our flight but it never went above 30%. My FO also stated his iPad started at 100% as well and while plugged in the entire flight he was already at 30% battery life. I quickly grabbed the paper QRH; did a quick search and did not see anything immediately that would help us solve the issue without more trouble shooting. Given my long day; fatigue starting to set in and the time of the situation I put the QRH back and told my FO to just continue hand flying the aircraft as it was probably going to take too much time to find the right section of the QRH with the turbulence and workload level of our flight. After putting the paper QRH away I then asked my FO if we would like to try level change at least while manual setting in the altitudes to see if that would do anything; to which he responded yes. Once I hit level change our vertical guidance on the flight director came back and noticing that; I engaged heading and our lateral guidance came back as well. I asked my FO if he was comfortable with me engaging LNAV/VNAV to see if it would re-engage and after his concurrence I did. We then recovered our Flight Detector and were able to re-engage our autopilot. After taking a few moments to make sure we were where we were supposed to be and doing what what we were supposed to do on the arrival; I finally had a moment to ask my FO if he would like me to load up runway change again. After his concurrence I did the runway change; verified the changes with my FO and hit execute. Once again; right around ZZZZZ intersection; our FD disappeared and the autopilot disconnect alerts chimed and we were also once again in CWS/CWP. We quickly went to LVL CHG and HDG selected followed by LNAV/VNAV to bring our flight directors back up followed by re-engaging the CMB B autopilot once we had made sure the aircraft was doing what it was supposed to be doing on the arrival. After this we decide if we had any other issues we would just hand fly the aircraft for the remainder of the flight. The rest of the flight went without incident as were just about finished with the STAR and told to expect vectors for a visual to XXR

This was my first time flying this aircraft; it was a checkout flight to then perform aerial glider tows. I started off in the morning with basic maneuvers at 3;000 ft. AGL. Descended down to perform touch and goes at the airport. During the 5th or 6th touch and go; on initial climb out about 50-100 ft. off the runway I heard a sputter of the engine and noticed my rpm dropped and I was not climbing anymore. I checked to make sure I had full power and everything was properly configured and I was still not climbing. I pushed on the stick to drop the nose down and noticed I was blown to the right side of the runway due to the crosswind. I had to make a landing and the engine was not providing performance. I did what I could to keep the airplane as straight as possible with the nose still down and flew the best I could into the ground. Without much time or altitude to make a decision I responded with what I could do. Upon making contact with the ground the landing gear collapsed and the prop struck the ground. Prior to this the airplane was showing no signs of any engine problems and I had a healthy engine performance up until then. I had full fuel and was only flying for about 30 minutes prior to the incident. A few weeks before this incident the annual had also been completed on this aircraft.

Aircraft X checked in with approach; and was given a vector of 265 for the visual approach Runway XX; descend and maintain 100. Aircraft X read back the correct heading but a wrong altitude of 80; and expecting visual Runway XX. The approach Controller missed the wrong altitude on the read back and went on to work a coordination with the Center and then other traffic. The computer generated Low Altitude alert never activated; but the approach Controller caught Aircraft X descending below the MVA at 82 and instructed the aircraft to climb to 100 immediately; also issuing an alert to check altitude immediately; MVA in your area is 92. Aircraft X was silent on the radio and did not reply until instructed a second time. Aircraft X began their climb back up to 100 and also stated they've had the terrain in sight.

Between XB:00 and XC:00 local time; Pilot In-Command (PIC) Name and Visual Observer (VO) Name 1 operated a DJI Matrice 210 V2.0 RTK quadcopter UAS for the purpose of mapping and documenting a construction site immediately southwest of ZZZ. We have been operated in this area and performing the same flights on a weekly basis since Date under a series of FAA authorizations; currently XXXX-ZXXX-XYZ-XXXXX. The area may be defined as that portion of ZZZ Class B Airspace within 0.25 nautical miles of latitude/longitude [fix]; at or below 200 ft AGL; or: VOR XXX at 3.6 - 0.25 nautical mile radius. The majority of this area covers the 0-foot portion of the ZZZ UASFM (Unmanned Aircraft Systems Facility Maps); but the eastern area overlaps with a 300-foot area of the UASFM.The terms of the authorization for the 0-foot area require us to notify ZZZ ATCT 30 minutes prior to launch. The PIC carried out this responsibility successfully with a call at XA:30 local. Actual launch time was around XB:05.The mapping flights are executed using DJI Ground Station Pro; an app which automates the flight grid and image capture. There are two mapping areas; north and south of road X; and these were carried out at ~197-199 feet AGL. Following the mapping flights; we fly a waypoint mission to collect oblique images of the site from cardinal directions. Two waypoints of this flight go up to 297 ft AGL in the area of the site which is covered by the 300 ft area of the UASFM. As part of our pre-flight operation; the PIC is responsible for obtaining a LAANC authorization prior to flight above 200 ft AGL into this area of the UASFM. However; when the pre-flight checklist was written; the PIC and the VO were using a wide-area authorization for ZZZ's UASFM which authorized flights to the altitudes published on the UASFM without prior notification. The PIC has been mentally substituting the LAANC request for this item.On Date 1; the PIC was distracted during pre-mission setup by a low-battery warning on the primary iPad in use; forcing him to switch to the secondary; and this was sufficient to cause him to forget to request the additional LAANC authorization for the 300-foot portion of the flight in the Aloft app. As a result; the PIC operated the UAS on the course of the waypoint mission about 100 ft above the maximum altitude authorized by active 14 CFR 107.41 authorizations. The PIC only realized this after landing; storing the UAS for travel; and calling to inform ZZZ ATCT that the operation was complete.At no time did the UAS operation interfere with manned-aircraft operations. I just forgot to request the LAANC authorization that I usually request prior to launch. As a corrective action; the PIC will update the pre-flight checklist already in place to include requesting the LAANC authorization.

Delayed reporting after Captain submitted [report]. Realized I should submit [a report] as well. Normal arrival into ZZZ. Snowstorm the previous night and into the morning. Ground taxi behind Aircraft Y with Captain riding the brakes. Taxiways with some snow and ice. Captain called for #2 engine shutdown. After arriving near the gate and lined up for a straight-in taxi; Captain set the parking brake; waiting for Ground crew to guide us in for the remaining 100 yards to the gate. Once directed by Ground crew; Captain released the parking brake and began to add power. No movement was noted and the Captain added more power; thinking that there was snow or ice preventing us from moving. I looked to checked that the parking brake was released and no message was displayed. I then looked at the pressure gauge and saw the needles pegged at 3000 psi; but was unable to recognize the discrepancy before the plane broke free with the asymmetric thrust and skidded in a 150-degree right hand turn. Once stopped; we confirmed that the needles were at 3000 psi with the brakes released. The Captain cycled the parking brake and the pressure returned to normal. With Ramp coordination; we continued our right-hand turn and returned to the gate normally. The brake issue was not reported via maintenance report since indications had return to normal. Follow-on flight crew was at the gate and we gave a verbal report of what happened with the brakes.

We were flying over CKN at 4500 ft. to set up for a simulated engine failure at altitude and make a power off landing on the airport. We were making a good amount of radio calls to let the airport CTAF know our intentions and scanned the area for traffic before we started descending. As we started a circling descent over the airport a yellow aircraft was holding short of Runway 13 and asked if they had enough time to takeoff before we came in. We let them know they would be able to takeoff because we still had a good amount of altitude to lose. As we were watching the yellow aircraft takeoff we were about 3000 ft. MSL and made another radio call while continuing the circling descent. All of a sudden a high wing aircraft (white with blue stripes) flew directly beneath us from the south; heading north; and made no attempt at making any radio calls. That traffic was not on ADSB either. I took the flight controls and started a climb back up and let the airport CTAF know that we were stopping the simulated engine failure. We watched that same white high wing aircraft with blue stripes continue flying north and seemed to have no intention on actually landing at Crookston. We decided to fly back to ZZZ after that event.[Caused by] an aircraft flying right over the Crookston airport at lower altitudes and not making any radio calls or listening to the airport CTAF.[I suggest] more information to general aviation pilots about making radio calls and listening to the CTAF frequency when near an airport to gain situational awareness about what is going on.

After doing a previous flight in Aircraft X; I was going to conduct another flight. I started the engine with a hot start checklist procedure. After the engine started cranking I applied full mixture and then applied throttle; immediately after that the aircraft started moving to the right and I couldn't reach full brakes. Next to the aircraft it was Aircraft Y; I hit it with the right wing of Aircraft X; on the spinner; this caused that the airplane to do an 180 turn. Next to Aircraft Y it was Aircraft Z; finally; the propeller of Aircraft X hit the right wing of Aircraft Y; the engine of Aircraft X stopped by itself; and the left wing tip of Aircraft X hit the rudder of Aircraft Z.

In my opinion Desk X on the AM shift for Date is flight release/task saturated. With the addition of 5G on top of an already hefty workload; I feel this desk Dispatcher could very easily lose operational control; if any Irregular Operations situations arise. This desk has ZZZ Functional Check Flight flights as well. So not only do I think the flights on my desk are at the boiling over pt.; throw in 5G; and ZZZ Functional Check Flight flights. This desk workload needs to be addressed. I do not feel I have or will lose operational control today; however I see this desk as setup for failure and could quickly slide down that slippery slope if anything were to arise. I did send a help alert for the potential of my desk needing help due to the sheer volume of work and daily work tasks. Factors that lead to my conclusion about my desk include daily weather/5G NOTAMs and material related/the shear amount of flights. The only solution I see as benefiting this situation is task reduction. More desk would equal less flights/tasks per desk.

At or just before reaching the final fix on the CLT JONZI2 arrival we saw momentary fail flags for GS; VPITCH; the flight plan dropped out (but left the approach in) and time and fuel calculation displays showed dashes. AP was engaged. The aircraft started to turn; reaching about 110 deg M before I got heading mode engaged. HDG was just being set to 090* per just received ATC heading instruction but I had not yet selected HDG when the turn started.In case this was a 5G issue I pressed the flight data event button. Don't know. The STAR has a 090 terminating HDG for the runway in use; which happened to match the ATC instruction just received.

While instructing S-turns with a student; working in a south to north direction between ZZZ and ZZZ1; a PA28 was observed descending towards our aircraft from a few hundred ft. above and head on. I took the controls from the students and went full power with a hard right turn. The PA28 continued to descend and began banking in the same direction as I was which would have been to their left contrary to right of way rules furthering the near miss incident.

Shortly after takeoff; a 'Door Open;' warning light appeared on the aircraft. As I was sitting in the right seat; I look back to discover the latch partially removed from the door and the door began bouncing and vibrating on its' hinge. I reached back in an attempt to secure the handle into the close position; at that time the door handle became full open and the door began violently bouncing on the safety clip. As I began to hold the handle; the clip sheared off (as there was LLWS/Light Turbulence). At that point in time; the student asked to return to the airport. After some delay in student action; the door became unbearable to hold close and my hand slid off. This caused the door to finally break loose and shear off in flight on the emergency release position. I advised the owner and the door appears to have landed into a lake with no damage or adverse impacts to the aircraft or property damage. After some self assessment; I believe the primary issue resulted in the latch breaking loose from light turbulence. When attempting to close the door and the loosing mechanism happened; after I held the door and saw the emergency clip failing to engage; I knew the door would be lost at that time. No action could be completed other than returning the aircraft safety to the ground.

My instructor and I were on final approach to land on Runway 17 doing touch and goes.  On our go-around we saw an aircraft opposite direction landing 35.  No communications were received from the other aircraft so we decided to side step to the east off the runway to avoid collision.  The other aircraft came in and landed on the runway.  Once clear of the runway the other aircraft radioed and apologized for being on the wrong frequency. They did not realize 17 was in use and other aircraft were in the pattern.

On a student solo XC (Cross Country) with Company flight school in ZZZ1. On approach to ZZZ; I set up to enter traffic pattern on a left downwind approach at a 45 for Runway XX. No issues entering downwind or turning base. I am in full landing configuration shortly after turning base as I have been taught. As I turned final; I notice I am a little high; so I power idle and pitch the nose down a little. On final with the nose pitch down towards the center runway numbers; my airspeed is about 76 kts. As I make my final call out to ZZZ traffic for short final; I transfer into ground effect. Was in ground effect a little bit past the 1;000 ft. markers while maintaining center line. As airspeed begins to bleed off; I pull back on the yoke gently to induce a flare as I am coming out of ground effect. My main gears make first contact with the runway and then the nose gear comes down. I still have control of the direction of the plane and maintaining center line. Shortly after landing; I try to apply brakes to slow down. At that point; I feel no tension on the brakes or no indication that me pressing down on the brakes is causing the plane to slow down. I take my foot off the brake pedals to reapply pressure and I still feel no tension or no indication that the brakes is slowing the plane down like in a normal landing. As I am continuing to reapply full pressure on brakes hoping that they will start working; I apply a little bit too much pressure to the left rudder while trying to get the brakes working again with no luck. The plane starts to turn a little to the left; I then add a little bit of right rudder to avoid turning too far left which causes the plane to skid to the left and then turn to the right. As the plane starts to turn to the right from me adding a right rudder; I then add a little bit of left rudder to regain control. As that happens; the plane skids a little to the right. These are not major inputs of rudder pressure to the left and right; but it was enough to cause the plane to skid on the runway in each direction as I try to regain control of the plane while causing the plane to somewhat slow down without the use of brakes at my disposal.At this point; I abandon the thought of the brakes working to cause the plane to slow down like brakes should do in a normal landing situation. I immediately shifted my focus to regaining control of the plane and safely coming to a complete stop with no damage done to the plane; airport; or myself. As the plane stops skidding to the right and maintains a straight path to the left side of Runway XX; it is still moving fast enough for me to conclude that the plane was going to go off the runway. Also; I know if I keep adding rudder inputs to try and keep it on the runway then I will continue to not have control without the use of brakes. With that in mind; the plane is on a direct path to the left side of Runway XX and heading towards a runway sign. If I would have kept going straight with the speed the plane was still going; I know for a fact that I would have run into the sign and caused damage to the plane; the airport; and possibly myself. With that in mind I just add a little bit of left rudder to turn the plane and avoided hitting the runway sign. I also concluded that the grass would help slow the plane down as I had no choice; but to let it roll in the grass to slow the plane down.As I am in the grass on the left side of Runway XX and avoided the runway sign; the plane is slowing down. It is still moving fast enough to run into what it appears to be high standing grass field or crop field. The height of the grass or crop field is higher than myself standing straight up on the climbing area of the right wing where you enter the aircraft from my observation. To avoid damage to the plane; I added right rudder to avoid the high grass/crop field and the plane turns to the right and comes to a complete stop. At this point; I am off to the left side of Runway XX away from potential danger of aircraft wanting to fly into the untowered airport. I immediately get on the CTAF to let ZZZ traffic know about the excursion; so they are made aware that there is no potential danger. Name; a CFI at Company; was in the area doing a training flight with a student pilot and contacted me on the CTAF to see if I was okay and safe. At the same time; other pilots on the frequency called in to see if I was okay. I informed the frequency that I was okay and safe. I gave brief explanation of what caused the excursions which was my brakes not working upon landing. Name told me that he was happy that I was okay and told me to complete the shutdown terminate checklist and immediately call my instructor; Name1; while Name proceeded turn around to come in and land to check on me. ZZZ personnel also drove over to see if I was okay and offered to help as I was talking to my Instructor on the phone for the next steps. Shortly after getting off the phone with my Flight Instructor; a representative from Company flight safety contacted me and advised me on the next steps.

ASOS obtained on ramp reported winds 110 degrees at 9 kts. so taxied to Runway 18 for departure. Received clearance from Wichita Approach Clearance Delivery 125.0 and advised to contact Wichita Approach on 134.8 for release. After initial hold for release; Departure advised release for departure and fly runway heading. Announced departure as taking runway on Unicom 122.7. On take-off roll traffic on final landing [Runway] 36 asked if I had not heard him report final landing 36 at AAO and I did not see him until that time. Evidently; I missed his call when talking on departure frequency. I stated traffic had been landing and departing Runway 18 but he stated winds were now 090. Approaching aircraft went around and over-flew my take-off. As I was coming into AAO earlier that day I heard a similar radio conversation between traffic landing using opposite ends of the runway at AAO. Runwya 36 is designated as calm winds runway which would probably apply to direct crosswind but due to near thunderstorm activity; winds must have changed from my taxi from the runway to departure end. Failure to adequately monitor Unicom while talking to departure contributed to this conflict.

During push back the aircraft became detached from the tug. There was no indication such as 'breakaway; breakaway'; or two-step alternating alert tone'. There was no communication from the pushback crew at all. During the push back the aircraft was moved to a spot as would be normally expected. We were given the 'cleared to start engines' instruction; and then the aircraft came to a stop for a moment or two. Then we started moving forward again. A ramper appeared aircraft left holding up the lockout pin; and the tug was moving forward away from the aircraft. I realized what had happened and smoothly applied the brakes. I am aware that ZZZ is primarily served by RJs and I am not sure if the ramp crew are [company] employees or not. I suspect there could be some differences in SOP from mainline aircraft and regional aircraft. However; I cannot stress enough the need for standardized communication in this process. We were never given the 'set brakes' command; which led me to believe we were still under tow. When in fact the ground crew had disconnected the tug; lockout pin and headset. The obvious danger here is we were rolling forward and the tug was backing up. To my vantage point; that looks normal; like we were still connected. The reality was the tug was reversing because it was trying to get away from the aircraft. We were fortunate to avoid damage or injury."

We were still in our climb to 41;000 ft. when we got a Master Caution; HYD indication and an A System Engine Driven Pump Low Pressure light illuminated. We verified what indication we had and I called for the QRH Checklist. After we completed that; I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them and Maintenance know our issue. As we continued we did notice a decrease in the A System quantity; but the pressure remained steady. Around 40 minutes later; the B System Engine Driven pump Low Pressure light also illuminated. I called for and we ran the same checklist for the Low Pressure light. We continued to have normal system pressure on the hydraulic pressure gauges so we decided to continue the flight. I instructed the First Officer to send another ACARS message to Dispatch; which he did.At this point; we ran through some possible scenarios and began to prepare for an A System failure. We input data for a normal and A System failure landing into the Weight and Balance. Then we discussed what might happen; once we started to put a higher load on the hydraulic system; such as lowering the gear and flaps; using thrust reverse and nose wheel steering. It became apparent to us that while we were operating normally; our situation could change rapidly. It was at this point we decided to advise ATC and proceed directly to ZZZ. We notified ATC of our hydraulic malfunction and our intention to go directly to our destination. I then asked the First Officer to notify Dispatch of our request for priority handling. He did via ACARS. I contacted the Flight Attendants and briefed them on what we planned to be a normal landing; but that we had requested priority handling and to expect to see the CFR vehicles near the runway.I also briefed the Passengers about the same situation. ATC cleared us direct to the airport and we started our descent. During the Approach Briefing; we had discussed configuring early to allow time for the electric pump gear and flap extension. Those worked as expected and we maintained normal pressure on the hydraulic gauges. The landing was normal. Thrust reverse and spoiler extension operated normally with the slightest of flicker from the Electric Pump Low Pressure lights as mentioned in the QRH. I even had normal nose wheel steering. We cleared the runway and I asked that CFR inspect the aircraft for any visible leaks. They saw none; so we continued to the gate in ZZZ. Upon arrival at the gate; I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. I then wrote up the Two Low Pressure light indications in the logbook.

Selected L autopilot on at 1200 [ft.] AGL; 230 kts.; slats retracting; VNAV engaged at about 5 degrees of pitch. When auto pilot became active; it directed an abrupt positive pitching moment. Passing 18 degrees of pitch with no sign of stabilizing; I deselected the autopilot and recovered the aircraft. No alerts of any anomalies displayed and stick shaker did not activate. When I took manual control of the aircraft after the event; the aircraft was significantly out of trim nose up. I considered raising the guarded switches and cutting out the trim; but I ascertained quickly that I was able to trim out the stick forces without being overridden by the trim system. After I stabilized the aircraft in normal flight; I engaged the L autopilot again and noted no other anomalies for the remainder of the flight. I wrote the event up in the [software program] and read a few hours later that the L autopilot was deferred. This event could have easily been a stall and recovery event if I had put the autopilot on and become occupied with another cockpit task. As it was; this event was an unusual attitude recovery. My assessment was that it was not the autopilot; but the inferior; substandard software logic of the MCP and FMS. Anomalies of unpredictable autopilot and auto throttle behavior are common in the 767. The entire software suite needs to be reworked by the manufacturer.

On my descent into ZZZ; I began to observe what appeared to be a compressor stall of some sort as I pulled my power back below 1;500 LBS of torque on my left engine. I moved the power back up and it stopped. As I continued my descent; it became apparent that I needed to shut down my left engine to avoid engine damage and to ensure passenger safety. I then decided that continuing into ZZZ from my current position was the safest option as they were the nearest suitable airport with plenty of runway; good weather; and I am familiar with the terrain. The Tower informed me that they [requested priority handling] for me; and cleared me to land. I executed a normal; stable approach and landing with no issues.

On Date; my student and I were conducting a landing lesson at Hendricks County Airport (2R2). There was another plane in the pattern; which we kept visual separation and good communication with. My student and I saw another plane approaching the area from the northeast on ADS-B but was not making any calls. As he continued inbound we assumed he was just exiting out from underneath the Class Charlie airspace. The plane then began to enter a left crosswind at around 500-600 feet AGL for Runway 18. My student and I were on the left downwind and the other plane in the pattern had just departed Runway 18. The other plane called his left crosswind and the other plane said they had just taken off [Runway] 18; the other plane did not say anything and just kept flying on crosswind joining the left downwind for 18. A few minutes later; my student and I departed 18 and made our traffic calls as needed. Once we were turning crosswind the other airplane made a call saying 'departing Runway 18' but did not say if he was staying in the pattern or exiting the area. As my student and I joined the left downwind leg for 18 the other aircraft immediately turned crosswind after takeoff. As doing so he was headed our direction and joined the downwind right behind us; no more than .5 mile separation. As he did so; I asked on comms of he had us insight and he said nothing. At this point my student and I came to the realization that he was gaining on us and I made the decision to take controls and execute a short approach into 18. My student was looking for the traffic as we were turning and he said he was no more than 200 feet away from us. As far as suggestions go; I believe there is not much more my student or I could have done. We did not know the intentions of the other pilot being he was not communicating with us. We were unable to climb to avoid traffic due to the Class Charlie airspace above.

Flight departed ZZZZ; during climb passing 9;000 ft. Number one FA (Flight Attendant) reported a burning rubber smell in the forward galley. FO (First Officer) (Pilot Flying) continued climb. Captain (Pilot Monitoring) reviewed system pages on ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor). No abnormalities noted. Captain initiated the Smoke/Fumes/Avionics Smoke QRH procedure. Continuing through the checklist; once the Commercial Pushbutton was pressed; inflight reported smell dissipating. The procedure was completed per SOP. The smell had been localized to the galley and first 3 rows of the cabin. The flight leveled off at 25;000. Captain placed a SELCAL to Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The decision was made to return to ZZZZ. Inflight and passengers were informed of the decision to return. Overweight checklist was completed. ATC was informed of our decision to return; no emergency declared. The aircraft returned to land without further incident. There were no reports of illness or discomfort from the passengers or crew. Logbook entries completed.

We were coming into ZZZ. Daytime VMC I was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). Coming into ZZZ the winds were shifting and variable. We had been set up to do the visual to Runway XX. Checking in with Approach they said the winds keep shifting and are currently variable at 9 [kts] between 010 and 330 and recommended visual to Runway XY since the wind has been favoring that way. We said OK we will plan Runway XY but told him we will need delay vectors to get set up for the approach since we were west of the field and it would be close to a straight in approach to Runway XY. Approach started to give us vectors so we could loose altitude; slow down; and get set up for the approach. As PM I changed our approach in the FMS to Runway XY and changed our landing numbers. The Pilot Flying (PF) then focused on flying and I briefed the approach due to it being a high area of vulnerability. ATC gave us vectors across final as we descended to 4000 ft. and got set up for the approach. Once we were briefed and felt caught up to the aircraft due to the runway change we told ATC we were ready for the approach. ATC gave us a vector onto final and said advise airport in sight. We had the airport in sight and got cleared for the visual Runway XY. We intercepted final around 2 NM prior to ZZZZZ at 3200ft. we were fully configured prior to ZZZZZ and crossed ZZZZZ at 3200 ft. We were in white needles but had blue preview needles up as well. The PF started descending to follow the glideslope (GS). The glideslope showed that they were high so they increased their descent rate to 900 fpm. Looking out the window we looked to be on glidepath but the mountainous terrain by ZZZZZ1 just looked closer than usual. I reminded the PF of the ZZZZZ1 crossing. But we were still showing high on the glideslope. we were at around 2600 ft. at the time and descending at 900 fpm. the PF shallowed out their descent to 700 fpm. Just Prior to ZZZZZ1 we got a 1000 [foot]  call at 2200 ft. from the radar altimeter (Airport elevation 955 ft.). About 2 seconds later we go a terrain warning followed by terrain; pull up aural. Our radar altimeter was saying we were 800 ft. AGL. PF disengaged the autopilot called max thrust flaps 8. we performed Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) escape maneuver. which cleared within 3 seconds. Then went into the Go-Around procedure. ATC gave runway heading to 4000 ft. We got vectors back around; briefed again; and did another visual approach to Runway XY this time in green needles. We crossed ZZZZZ at 3200 ft. like before and followed the glideslope down in green needles. the GS seemed to be working well this time. Descent rate was about 700 fpm the whole way down and we did not get a CFIT warning. Landed without incident. The biggest cause was the confusion between what the GS was telling us and what our eyes were telling us on the approach. caused us to loose situational awareness due to the confusion. We were showing high on the glideslope and possibly were getting bad readings from it since we were actually low. The PF had never been to ZZZ; and I had only been there once back in Month. Inexperience with the airport and the contradiction of instruments and visual ques. The use of the higher descent rate also triggered the CFIT event most likely since our navigation equipment was showing us to be high.Suggestions: On visual approach's trust your eyes as well as your instruments. If something doesn't look right; and your eyes are not matching the instruments execute a go around and try again. Don't wait until the plane tells you to go around with a CFIT escape maneuver. Make sure to brief high descent rates when doing approaches in mountainous terrain. If you are unfamiliar with an airport or mountainous airports take your time.

During push back; the pin that holds the handle down on the tow bar became dislodged and the tow bar separated from the aircraft. Due to the downhill gradient off of the gate; the aircraft rolled backwards quickly. Even though they were using wireless equipment; the Push Crew never said a word. By the time I noticed the tug was disconnected; we were rolling backwards pretty fast. I did not know exactly what was behind us; so I aggressively applied the brakes. A Flight Attendant fell due to the quick stop and was injured. The Push Crew should have communicated that the aircraft was inadvertently disconnected from the tow bar. I should not have applied the brakes so aggressively. I was not aware that the aircraft could disconnect from the tow bar. I think this scenario could be discussed during upgrade training.

We turned the engine bleeds off while taxiing into the gate from our first flight; to prevent a dual bleed light. The First Officer forgot to turn them back on after engine starting. We performed the appropriate checklists and the appropriate calls were made; but we forgot to visually check the bleed sources were in the correct position; when the Captain responded to the checklist. We climbed out as normal; but as we were performing the 10;000 ft. Checklist; the Cabin Pressure Warning horn and light went off. We leveled off at 10;000 ft.; told ATC and immediately realized what we had done. We turned the bleeds on; went through the QRH to resolved the issue; and the cabin pressurized as normal. We notified ATC and the Flight Attendants; continued the climb and proceeded on course as intended. No others issues entailed during the flight. Threats to this situation were an extremely early report time and early morning awakening for both Crew Members. First Officer was new and Captain visually looked at bleeds during checklist and responded with what was 'expected' but not as the bleeds actually were.Making sure that you respond to what you see not what you expect during checklist callouts And verifying bleed sources are in the correct position; after engine starting and shutting down the APU.

I was approaching to land on Runway XX at ZZZ airport. I was flying VFR from ZZZ1 to ZZZ.  I was receiving VFR flight following from ZZZ1 Center; and just prior to landing; I had been switched over to ZZZ Center.  I cancelled services with them approximately 10 nm from ZZZ squawked VFR; and made my comms on the CTAF on XYY.Z.This is an airport I'm very familiar with; as I've landed at ZZZ dozens of times.  It's a small non-towered airport with a short and fairly narrow runway.  Because of this; even though visibility was fine; I always fly direct to ZZZZZ; ZZZZZ1; and ZZZZZ2 just so I know I'll be lined up with Runway XX on approach.  Once I was on short final; I could tell that the runway was wet.  The runway at ZZZ is only a little over 3;XXX feet in length; so I knew I would have to brake as soon as I touched down at the runway threshold. Once I touched down; I braked and began hydroplaning; so I let up on the brakes to straighten the aircraft back out and and to coast for a second before I reapplied the brakes. At that point; I simply ran out of runway before I could bring the airplane to a stop.At the end of a runway; I skidded off; causing some damage to the plane.

While climbing through 11;000 ft. I experienced a rapid decline in Manifold Pressure in the right engine of my Cessna 340. I requested priority handling; shut down the engine; and made a single engine landing at ZZZ. This aircraft had been running good up until the loss of power. I am very proud of the way I handled this event. I swiftly and properly shut down and secured the right engine. I was over the ZZZ Airport at the time. I circled down in VFR conditions and made a very nice single engine landing with no additional mishap. I then pulled the plane off of the runway called ATC on the phone to report that the runway was clear. We then left Aircraft X at ZZZ with FBO for repair.

Radio failureOn Day 0; I was on a pleasure trip from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. I was on an IFR flight plan for the duration of the trip. However; the weather was clear until we got to ZZZ2. ZZZ2 was overcast with ceilings reported as 2;700 ft. I went across the lake at 13;000 ft. I was cleared to 4;000 ft. and direct to ZZZZZ; the initial approach fix for the RNAV XX approach to ZZZ2. I was not cleared for the approach. I had been talking to ZZZ Center. Descending through 5;500 ft. I reported to ZZZ that the cloud tops were at 5;500. I had no acknowledgement from ZZZ. When I got to 4;000 ft. I reported it to ZZZ and again there was no acknowledgement. I tried Unicom for ZZZ2 as sometimes they have a ranger at the airport to report conditions. Again; I got no reply. At this point I noted the coms area of my Garmin 750 was 'X'ed' out. I had radio failure. This was a situation that I had never encountered before.Since I didn't know why my coms were out I had no way to contact anyone. At 4;000 ft. I was now VFR even though AWOS had reported ceilings over the island at 2;700 ft. There was no traffic in the area. I knew from having been to ZZZ2 many times that I would lose ZZZ somewhere in the 3-5;000 ft. altitude area. It was not unusual for the ZZZ2 airport to not be staffed. However; with my coms 'X'ed' out on my 750 it appeared that I had radio failure. At the time I was unaware that my passenger in the co-pilot seat had bumped my avionic fuse area with his knee allowing the fuse to the coms to pop out; turning off my coms. When looking at the fuses I simply missed that that fuse was popped out. At the time I didn't know the procedure for lost coms when not on the approach. I debated turning my transponder to squawk 1200 and landing. I thought about squawking 7600; and landing. However; I wasn't aware I should have gone into a hold at the last fix ZZZ Center had given me. Since I was VFR; I elected to land using the approach. I was VFR so if there had been traffic in the area I would have seen them. Meanwhile; ZZZ Center tried to raise me by their radios and other planes in the area; as well as through the ranger at the ZZZ2 airport without success. After I landed I was asked to call ZZZ Center. I spoke with an agent in ZZZ who nicely explained that I should have gone to my last fix and entered a hold. The issue I have with the idea I should have gone into a holding pattern at the last fix given me is that it appeared to me that I had no radios to contact anyone and it appeared there was nothing that was going to improve that over time. At the time I was VFR so not a danger to not seeing a plane in the pattern. Reviewing the FAR's it seems like the option to land is ok given the situation I was in.In retrospect. I should have checked the coms fuse more closely. It was an easy fix; but I simply missed it. Given that my coms were out for the foreseeable future and I was in VFR weather; I think the next best option would have been to squawk 1200 and land. Lastly I could have squawked 7600 so Center would at least known my issue and landed.

Report menu will not let me choose hours awake before event and hours on duty before event. Actual times are 4 hours awake and 3 hours on duty. Flight was normal all the way up to and including cruise at FL 340. Upon climbing out of cruise from FL340 to FL 360; the First Officer (FO) airspeed indicator started increasing and the IAS disagree annunciation appeared on both ADI's. Moments later the alt disagree annunciator appeared on both ADI's; as well. The FO airspeed was approaching Mach limit and the over speed clacker annunciated. Initial action Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) items were completed and it was determined that the Captain (CA) airspeed and altitude information was correct and matched the standby instruments. Manual pitch and power settings for flaps up were also used to confirm the reliability of the operating CA airspeed and altimeter. The Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) checklist for airspeed unreliable was executed and all steps complied with. Aircraft was no longer RVSM compliant and ATC directed a decent to FL 280. This put our fuel status in a state that would no longer reach our scheduled destination of ZZZ1. The CA contacted Maintenance and there was no available solution to remedy the aircraft status. After working with dispatch; ZZZ2 was determined to be the best divert location. At that time we requested priority and requested routing to ZZZ2. After setting up for the arrival and approach into ZZZ2 for XXL; we started to descend from FL280. During the descent; the FO airspeed began rapidly decreasing to the point where the FO airspeed was bottomed out at 45 kts passing FL180 while the CA airspeed read 250. While the aircraft entered the stall warning red zone; the stick shaker did NOT activate. Overweight landing checklist was also ran. After descending through approximately 13000 ft.; the FO airspeed and altimeter readings appeared to revert back to normal and match the CA's and standby readings. Landing and taxi to park were uneventful. Also on descent during the recall check; the FO noticed an engine warning and both EEC's were in alternate mode. Checklists were ran for that condition and the engines operated in alternate mode for the rest of the flight. Alternate mode was not displayed after engine shut down.

The previous afternoon; the aircraft had been worked on by an A&P and returned to service for a fault in the electrical charging system. Upon startup the next morning at ZZZ1; the alternator failed to come online as evidenced by the ammeter reading zero. After a brief phone call to the mechanic; I was advised to try briefly cycling the master switch which produced no results. The mechanic said he would drive to the airport to look at the problem.In the meantime; I read through the POH which; being from 1964; is not very detailed. It does however describe resetting the over-voltage relay by turning off the master switch for a full 30 seconds. I elected to shut the plane down by pulling the mixture and turned off the master as well. After more than 30 seconds; I restarted the aircraft and the alternator came online normally.To verify everything was working; I ran the engine up to about 1700 rpm for 5-10 seconds and also switched the avionics on/off 2 or 3 times. Everything reacted normally with the ammeter showing more load as devices were turned on. I proceeded with the 20-minute flight to my destination (ZZZ) where I was to meet another person for a local flight.About 2 miles from my destination (in Class E airspace); the transmit on the radio produced static; and I suspected low voltage. I was able to land normally. I sat on the ramp for about 20-25 minutes with the engine at fast-idle and all avionics turned off; in the hopes of reducing the load so that the battery would better charge.After turning the avionics back on; we departed normally and flew for about an hour with things working as expected. When returning to ZZZ to drop off my passenger; about 2 miles from the airport; the electrical system failed due to what seemed like low voltage. We used a handheld radio to enter the pattern while making radio calls and landed normally. We were the only aircraft using the airport at the time.While we had the avionics on during flight; there is a chance that due to the possibly low voltage; our ADS-B signal became inoperative. After landing back at ZZZ; we called a mechanic to come service the airplane with a fresh battery so we could have ample electrical power for the short flight back to our home base of ZZZ1 where the charging system could be examined.There is no good way to know if our ADS-B was fully operational near the end of each flight as the voltage appeared to drop to a low state. The electrically powered fuel gauges and electric fuel pump worked normally at all times as they require only small amounts of power.

Captain is pilot monitoring (PM) and First Officer acted as pilot flying (PF). While cruising at FL330; 'Bleed 1 fail' message appeared on EICAS. Crew ran the associated QRH procedure; and issue appeared to be resolved. Minutes later; Bleed 1 fail message re-appeared; and we requested a descent down to FL310 where we could continue the flight with a single bleed source. Approximately 5 minutes later; Bleed 2 fail message appeared. The PM repeated the reset procedure for Bleed 2. After the message failed to extinguish; the PM called for an immediate descent down to 15;000 so we could pressurize the cabin with our APU. PF began a priority descent; but due to the high workload; failed to reference the Electrical Power Center (EPC) for priority descent. As a result of the high workload; and failing to call for EPC; the crew overlooked squawking 7700; and never officially declared; however; ATC asked the crew for souls on board and remaining fuel which was interpreted by us as a declaration of priority for us. Weather in the descent was broken ceilings all the way down. PF remained focused on flying and scanning instruments; as the PM requested vectors and attempted to start the APU so we could maintain 15;000 ft. ATC provided vectors due to mountainous terrain. After multiple failed attempts to start the APU; crew requested further descent to 9;000; ATC was unable to accommodate this due to high terrain; and instead cleared us to maintain 10;000. Due to the inability to start the APU for pressurization; the crew reset the bleeds; as another attempt to regain some sort of pressurization. Throughout the time descending; cabin altitude was being called out by the PF; and the PM called for oxygen masks to be donned. Upon donning the masks; PF realized that their microphone was INOP; and could only motion to the PM that they were unable to communicate. Around this time; cabin altitude was in the red; and the aural warning sounded for CABIN ALT HI; unfortunately again the EPC was overlooked due to the high workload. Passenger oxygen masks did not deploy. Upon reaching 10;000 ft.; we had entered into a valley of surrounding mountains; and due to this were receiving vectors to circle us in the area while we decided what to do. The PF; still unable to talk with the oxygen mask on noted that cabin altitude was returning to normal levels; and the crew opted to re-stow masks so crew communications wouldn't be interrupted. An airport (ZZZ1) was offered to us; but the crew decided that it was only a last resort option; as it was not an approved airport; and as such as did not have charts or other information available to us for the field. After multiple attempts to start the APU; we had a successful start; and now had a higher altitude of 15;000 available to us. With this increase in altitude; we decided on ZZZ as our diversion airport; and received vectors to the airport. Crew ran emergency ABC's to ensure they had not missed anything prior to landing; and safely touched down at ZZZ.

During descent through 9000 ft.; a slight oily smell was noted in the cockpit by both pilots. The APU was not in use at the time. After we blocked in and the cabin door was opened; a noticeable oily smell was noticed throughout the cabin. The smell persisted. About 1 hour later; the smell was still apparent in the cabin and cockpit and was noted by both pilots and operations. A logbook entry was made; the odor form was completed; the odor survey was completed; and a report was submitted. Aircraft was removed from service.

On Date; I was pilot in command of Aircraft X. I departed ZZZ1 in the late morning; intending to practice visual approaches at ZZZ and return home. On my fourth practice approach for Runway XX. I was on glide slope when I felt a stall buffet and pitched the nose down. I had become slower than intended on final approach. I applied full throttle; waited a moment and leveled the airplane; but felt another stall buffet and pitched down again as required. Since engine spool-up time in the L-39 is relatively slow; I was unable to recover enough airspeed to generate the lift required to arrest my descent and make the runway. I made a controlled landing approximately 1;000 ft. short of the runway threshold in the grass. This landing caused minor damage both to the airplane and to one of the runway approach lights. I was able to maneuver the airplane back onto Runway XX and came to a full stop. There were no injuries.

Batt V 23.2 prior to start; initiated start and Batt V dropped to 13.4V but recovered quickly through 14V. Continued scan of VEMD; T4 rising normally; oil pressure check; and when scanning back to Batt V; noticed T4 needle moving quickly. Moved start selector to OFF and immediately noted OVERLIMIT DETECTED on upper VEMD. Accessed Maintenance pages and noted T4 of 871'C.Batteries that are cycled through show good voltage on preflight / before start checks; but how they will respond to a starter load is an unknown. Future first flight of day starts during cold weather / cold aircraft will be Start Pak assisted.

At cruise; both Pilots noticed an unfamiliar smell in the Flight Deck. We coordinated with the Flight Attendants (FA). The FAs in the rear smelled something as well. The smell was possibly electric. We ran the Fumes Checklist in the QRH. After a few minutes; the fumes seemed to dissipate. We coordinated with Dispatch and continued to ZZZ. Descent; approach and landing were uneventful.

We were on final cleared to land XXR back into ZZZ. There was an Aircraft X that just touched down Runway YY. Their instructions were cleared to land; they decided to do a touch and go without proper authorization and rotated directly into us. At the time of their rotation; we were just about to cross over Runway YY. ATC told Aircraft X to turn immediately left heading 230. We immediately turned right and climbed as traffic was turning directly in front of us. They received a possible pilot deviation and we safely entered a right downwind YY and landed. At the closest point we were within 500 ft. of their aircraft.

On DATE while taking off from ZZZ; I experienced engine trouble on the climb out from ZZZ. I noticed when I was accelerating down the Runway and obtaining airspeed the engine seemed to be a little labored. I was able to rotate and get off of the ground but when I started to climb I could not build airspeed and proper climb rate. The stall horn was constant and I had to level the plane to keep from going into a stall. I was able to add very little pitch and make a right turn to head back towards the Runway. As I was making this slow turn; I had transferred over to ATC Departure and advised the Controller that I was requesting priority handling due to an engine malfunction and needed to land immediately. The Controller advised he was contacting ZZZ Tower and to switch back to that frequency. I switched back to Tower and the Controller was able to clear the airspace so I could land back at the airport. While making these transmissions; I was only able to obtain and additional 200 ft. above AGL. The engine was still laboring and my airspeed would not increase. I went through the checklist and the systems of the aircraft. The Flaps were at the proper setting for takeoff; the trim was set for takeoff; I had full rpm and manifold pressure. There was no ice or debris on the wings. The preflight procedures had no issues with runup or engine malfunctions.

I was the pilot monitoring with FO (First Officer) flying. We had the left PACK deferred and before the flight went through the MEL and discussed the procedure we would follow transferring bleeds from APU to engines after takeoff. We noted a very recent flight (possibly the same day) had a PACK high pressure issue under the same circumstances; and agreed to be extra cautious when doing the transfer. Unrelated; but on push back the ground spoilers deployed for some reason. They then retracted at some point leaving the IB ground spoiler fault status message. This caused us to spend about 15 minutes running a fault reset; which was successful. After lift off and at a safe altitude (about 5;000 ft.) as the procedure prescribes; FO decreased the thrust and I transferred the bleeds using the exact procedure from the MEL. (decrease thrust; open right 10th and close the LCV (Load Control Valve) and ISOL (Isolation Valve); etc). The pack initially worked fine; we increased thrust to normal and probably a minute or two later the PACK turned off. It gave no cautions or indications; we could feel the aircraft lose airflow and start to depressurize. At this point we were coming through 9;000 ft. and we asked to level off. We stayed at 9k for about maybe 10 minutes while I attempted to reset the pack. I turned it off and on about 3 times monitoring the ECS (Environmental Control System) page with no luck. At this point we received word from Dispatch to return to ZZZ and we turned around and requested a lower altitude; ending at 4;000 ft. and I performed the unpressurized flight QRH procedure. I informed the passengers and the FA (Flight Attendant) that we would be returning to ZZZ and apologized for the uncomfortable cabin. Closer to the field we determined that we would be close to max landing weight and FO suggested we drop the gear to help burn extra fuel. We then were about to turn final I requested a single 360 to make sure we were within weight. We landed normally and we were given a gate and pulled right in. Faulty PACK with single pack deferred; or faulty RH 10th stage valve.Dispatch of a single PACK airplane with a previous high press write up could/should be avoided. If I would have had more time I would have contacted AIRINC (I was about to call but right then we were ACARSed back for the return) and gotten more information on things I could have tried; such as attempting to bleed from the APU again or retrying the 10th stage valve. However; after feeling and hearing about how uncomfortable the cabin was; and performing the unpressurized procedure to return to ZZZ my focus was on a safe landing back at base.
