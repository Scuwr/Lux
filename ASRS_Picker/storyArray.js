New Hire Student First Officer on initial operating experience has bounced landing due to lack of feel of aircraft approaching ground during the landing phase of flight. On go-around; the student applied max thrust and relaxed back stick pressure causing the aircraft to point at the ground requiring Instructor to take controls to avoid ground impact and execute go-around procedure. Student inability to identify aircraft closure rate with ground to start aircraft flare on time; resulting in bounced landing. Instructor Response; have a training event that focuses specifically on balked landings and go-around during simulator training for First Officers prior to releasing students to the line for initial operating experience. Implement a policy for initial operating experience students to return to simulator for specific landing practice if not on track to complete initial operating experience by the 50 hour point due to deficiencies in landing the aircraft.

During initial climb; passing about 8000 feet an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) Cargo Smoke Warning occurred; but then quickly stopped and went away. However; the last page; only; of the ECAM Actions for cargo smoke was displayed on the STS (Status) page. Moments later; passing through about 10000 feet the same warning recurred and again stopped and vanished. The STS continued to display the same last page.Since we [were] coasting-out and were unable to determine whether or not we were on fire; and unable to determine if the warning was for the for the forward or aft cargo compartment; I transferred aircraft control and ATC communications responsibilities to the First Officer; with the command to request priority handling and return to the departure airport ASAP.We each completed our divided duties and re-joined as a crew; so to speak; on about a 10 mile final. Although we were about 21;000 pounds above maximum landing weight; First Officer rolled the aircraft onto the runway as smooth as could be and brought us to a stop on the center line. I found the procedure of calling 'My Aircraft' and the onset of both warnings very helpful. And the method of dividing responsibilities; i.e.; 'Your aircraft; your radios' to serve us perfectly as well.

Broken Stab R2 brake assembly removed and stowed in flight deck. Please review MEL XX-XX-X and XX-XX-X. The stabilizer has two EMCU (Electric Motor Control Unit) units L2 and R2. Their inputs are single path summed inputs to the HTAS (Horizontal Trimmable Stabilizer System) (Company name for the jack screw that moves the horizontal stabilizer). This MEL allows one of the two to be inoperable (and requires the entire EMCU and brake assembly to be removed); and for the plane to fly 10 flights before being fixed with no restrictions (such as no ETOPS; etc). In the last several years a high proportion of fatal aviation crashes have involved broken stabilizers or jack screws. A single failure of the remaining control unit (but breaking in a different way than unanticipated by Boeing) could create a very difficult to control airplane. The backup for the remaining stabilizer control unit is the elevators to provide pitch control--but they could be fighting against a non-faired stabilizer and CG both moving in the same direction against them. Issues with MEL: 1. Only a single failure of the other EMCU stabilizer motor control brake unit could create a priority situation. While the elevators could still control pitch; the non normal checklist for stabilizer requires a flaps 20 landing because elevators alone may be insufficient to overcome an out of position stabilizer. An example of this scenario is where the plane is loaded with an aft CG requiring nose down trim on the nose down limit for takeoff (what we had) and the stabilizer assembly breaks on transition from climb to cruise and locks in the climb attitude. You would have two strong forces pitching the nose up and the smaller elevator surfaces to bring it down again. Additionally this stabilizer position would create parasitic drag and increase fuel burn.2. Unlike other parts on the plane (for example the center fuel pumps; each of which can fully fuel both engines); the stabilizer control units are each designed for only half the load/work of moving the horizontal stabilizer. This is called single path summed inputs design. This is evidenced by the fact the trim rate drops to half with the MEL. When you remove a part of system and leave the remaining parts under a heavier than normal strain they are likely to break earlier and different than they otherwise might have. For connected systems the failure of one component can often cause damage to any attached system elements because as one brake assembly is breaking it is putting greater than normal load and strain on the remaining unit and everything else attached to it. The fact that this MEL could allow 100 hours plus of flight time on the remaining stabilizer assembly is increasing the chance that it breaks. Any wear statistics on the stabilizer assemblies are based on both working in concert each taking half the load. Does Boeing really have failure data on a single assembly? Especially flown over 100 hours; and after the other one was breaking first?3. Dispatch over ETOPS compounds the problems a single failure could create. Parasitic drag of the stabilizer could increase fuel burn. Alternates are far away.4. The EMCU R2 was removed and placed in the flight deck and not tied down. So created a hazard for the pilots.

During our approach into ZZZ; we where given the RNAV GPS XX; using high LPV minimums. During the brief we added in a 2 mile fix around the FAF to give us visual awareness for the 'GPS APPROACH' callout. Our initial ATIS information we received called for 10 miles of visibility; high winds and a ceiling of 6500 ft. As we descended through the STAR and vectors to the GPS approach; weather was rapidly deteriorating. On final approach we descended down to 1700 ft. and the next altitude was of 800 ft. was set. Once approaching the 2 mile point the GPS approach was called and I started a vertical descent of 700 fpm mistaking it for the 0.2NM descent. With Windshear and poor visibility; I was focused on maintain proper airspeed to ensure no over speed occurred. The Captain was making sure we had forward visibility and when he glanced back into the cockpit he noticed we were below the snowflake. At the time we were approaching 1100 ft. and ATC made an altitude alert call. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and rejoined the snowflake and continued down on a 700 fpm descent following the guidance.No contact of the runway environment was made and a go-around was initiated. On the go-around ATC noted that multiple aircraft have gone around at this point. During this time a new ATIS had come out with a visibility of 1 1/2SM. We didn't realize this until after making it on the ground. ATC was giving weather updates stating that improving visibility was from the viewpoint of the Tower but no actual visibility was stated as well as ceiling updates. We went around and made a second attempt using the GPS XX approach and made contact with the runway environment and landed. With the favorable weather conditions upon the original ATIS information; we had an expectation bias that the weather was going to be good upon landing. Poor visibility due to dropping weather conditions and high winds caused a high workload environment. We set up a 2 mile fix around the FAF; ZZZZZ; to remind us to call out 'GPS APPROACH' callout. I mistakenly mistook the 2 mile distance from the FAF for the 0.2 mile distance to initiate the descent. With both the CA (Captain) and I in a high workload situation in poor weather conditions; the callout for 'VS' was unchecked even though the confirmation of 'VS' was made. The distraction wind shear and monitoring the airspeed caused me to not fully check the distance correctly from the FAF. This brought the aircraft to descend too early and caused the low altitude callout from ATC. Another error of the cause was a lack of experience on my part; this was my second GPS approach in a real aircraft in weather conditions. A go-around should have been made instead of continuing the approach even though forward visibility was there when we received the Low Altitude Alert. Had we known the visibility an approach into ZZZ1 would have been more reasonable. Even though the checklist for the GPS approach was briefed; it probably would have been good to go over it again once closer to the airport to ensure all callouts and actions are properly made. An ILS approach would have given us more visual awareness and a reduced workload. Checking the automatic ATIS update prior to making the second attempt. Another suggestion would be to review familiarize myself with GPS approaches more so since I have only done two at this point.

When the flight crew arrived at the aircraft; it had been towed from the maintenance hangar sometime in the middle of the night before our departure. During preflight; the Captain noticed the Gear Pins were missing from the cockpit and the FO reported after his preflight walk around that they were still installed in the Landing Gear. The AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) showed that the Gear Pins had been removed and stowed the night prior by employee NUMBER. The Captain contacted OPS on the radio ad well as Maintenance Control by telephone; and entered the discrepancy in the AML . The local ZZZ OPS sent a newly hired ramper who immediately removed the three gear pins; and rushed them to the cockpit. The ramp agent did not know where they belonged in the cockpit or how to store them. He was also not trained or authorized to make any entries in the AML. The CA discussed the issue with the ramp agent; an operations agent; and the Maintenance Representative who later arrived at the airplane. All three stated that there is an ongoing issue at ZZZ where ramp teams tow aircraft from the maintenance hangar to the gates in the morning with zero representation from the maintenance team.These ramp tow teams have been performing unauthorized maintenance on the aircraft by installing and removing gear pins without properly logging such activities in the AML. The Ramp agent and Maintenance agent expressed that this was at least the third instance of an aircraft being released to a flight crew with installed Gear Pins (and no AML logging) in the last week. Maintenance verified the Gear Pins were properly removed and stowed; and then signed off the AML while the FO performed a new preflight walk-around inspection. Ramp Agents are performing unscheduled and undocumented Gear Pin installations on aircraft. This greatly and significantly increases the chances of an aircraft launching with the Gear Pins installed. The 'Swiss cheese holes' are lining up! Immediately stop the ZZZ ramp crews from towing aircraft without properly documenting when they have installed the Gear Pins. Provide training to all ZZZ operations managers and ramp agents on the importance of proper procedures; AML logging; and the dangers of an aircraft launching with Gear Pins installed.

Electrical problem whereby entire avionics system and engine lost power temporarily; then intermittently until landing. Headed straight in to ZZZ. Configured aircraft for best glide. Initial thoughts were battery/alternator problems (Have 2 Alternators and 2 Batteries); but avionics were in the process of rebooting so could not observe Voltage/Amperage at first. Avionics rebooted; and began emergency procedures: Battery Voltages Green; Alternators producing voltage/amperage; all Circuit breakers in; switched to ECU 2 (backup ECU) and Fuel Pump 2; switch fuel tanks. Radios came up; called into ZZZ Unicom and advised local traffic that I was having problems and coming in on a right base for Runway XX. Noticed there was power lines running across my path to Runway XX; observed to ensure clearance. Resumed diagnosis; and deduced might be the Electronic Bus Mgr. upon which time engaged the Emergency Bus Bypass switch which routes direct power to the Buses. Reached over and Pulled RPM control (Prop pitch) back to reduce drag and began slight turn to line up with Runway XX once Power Lines were cleared. At 300 ft. AGL; had runway made and continued reduced power descent. Dropped landing gear; received Green Light on Nose; but not Mains. Was now at about 50 ft. AGL and just about to cross threshold. Pumped emergency gear pump a couple of times and noticed the Emergency Bus Bypass switch was back in the off position. Quickly flipped it on again and dropped full flaps. Engine began to come alive again and thought for a moment that I should do a go around and work on gear; but decided that I had runway made and wasn't sure that problem was totally fixed. Decided continued landing was smartest/safest bet.Touched down at 65 kts.; soft landing; but Mains had not locked out and retracted back into wells. Nose Gear remained down and aircraft settled on rear tie down skid under tail. Shut engine down to avoid prop strike if Nose Gear happened to give way. Continued down runway with no braking (brakes are on Mains) and limited rudder authority. As aircraft slowed to about 20 kts.; lost rudder authority and aircraft slowly veered to left side of Runway XX and came to full stop about 25 ft. in soft turf at which point the nose gear retracted and aircraft sat down on belly.Damage incurred:Minor repairable abrasions on belly and Tail skid section.Nose Gear Hydraulic Cylinder brokeOne of Three prop blades damaged when nose gear retracted at stop; unrepairable remaining blades and hub no damage.Time from Occurrence to landing = 3 mins

We had a PACK INOP on take off out of ZZZ on Aircraft X. We transferred the bleeds from the APU to the engines when we got a Left PACK High Press Caution Message. We ran the QRH at 3;000 ft. and the Caution Message continued. We then proceeded to the unpressurized flight QRH and completed that. At that time cabin temp was 32 Degrees C; and we were close to reserve fuel landing in ZZZ1. We deemed the safest option was to go back to ZZZ. Cause: Complex single pack operations. QRH was vague in stating that if the High pressure caution message continues that the Pilot should then proceed to the unpressurized flight QRH.

We took off Runway XX out of ZZZ. I was the Pilot Flying (PF). Climbing out of 7;000 ft. we experienced a loud bang; accompanied by severe shaking and vibrations. After a second bang; I looked at the engine indications and saw the right engine was surging severely. I suspected a compressor stall.  I immediately shallowed our climb; pulled the thrust lever to idle and the compressor stall went away with normal engine indications at idle. The Captain (CA) initiated a request for priority handling with ZZZ Approach; and we leveled off at 8;000 ft. We ran the ECAM procedure and pulled out the QRH for Engine Stall. We ran it and tried several times advancing the thrust lever; and the compressor stall returned every time. We left the thrust lever at idle; ran the single-engine approach procedures and told ATC we were diverting to ZZZ2. I continued being the PF and flew the ILS to [Runway] YYR. The landing was uneventful; and we exited the runway. As we began exiting the runway the engine auto-shutdown and displayed an Engine Stall ECAM. I transferred control to the Captain; ran the ECAM procedure; and we came to a stop. Airport Rescue & Firefighting checked over the aircraft and the right engine and saw no abnormal indications. We taxied to Gate XXX and disembarked the passengers as normal.No factors played a role in this from the flight crew. All indications and procedures were normal up to this point.No suggestions; this was a mechanical issue.

We were on X country dual time building flight ZZZ to ZZZ1. During preflight we noticed oil level was very low around 1 quartz; so we added 6 quarts during preflight. After ground check was normal; we taxied to Runway XX. When holding; the alternator amps where at zero; volts where at 23; and battery amps where at zero; even when alternator where turn off the battery amps went negative (troubleshoot was unsuccessful). Also; oil temperature indicated 235 Fahrenheit (almost touching the red range). We requested Tower to taxi back to ramp. While taxing back we also experienced issues with hand brake. After returning safely to ramp; airplane was squawked for all the issues noted.

I had experienced an alternator failure enroute from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and made a precautionary landing at ZZZ2. A local retired A&P assisted in checking the airplane and removing the battery. I had called my local A&P and he flew a C-210 and brought a 24 volt charger and charged the battery. It was expected the battery would have enough charge to make sure that I had lights to land. I took off; with my passenger; a private pilot. We wanted to get as much daylight as possible. We had agreed prior that I would fly at 2;500 ft. and the C-210 would fly at 3;000 ft. The A&P was to call the tower; explain the situation and be on the lookout for me and then follow. While I was flying; the private pilot was trying to contact tower via text and voice messages. About 15 miles out; I activated every light that I had. All along; both the private pilot and myself were monitoring our individual Foreflights on tablets and phones to look out for traffic. As we were approaching ZZZ1; I check the favored runway. I saw both [Runway] XX and YY were indicating 2kt; but XX was favored. It was my plan to enter a 45 for a right downwind to obtain a light gun. As I was monitoring Foreflight; I noticed traffic taking off on YY. At that time; I made the decision to turn wide and enter a left downwind for YY for a light gun. Not receiving any; not observing any traffic; I landed. As I am on short final; I notice that I have a landing light; and flashing strobes reflecting off the ground. As I taxied to the hangars; I noticed that my A&P were landing on [Runway] XX. After I shut down; I called the tower on my cell phone. I explained to the controller what I have shared here. While talking with him; a fireman wanted to obtain my info. The tower controller said; 'I just popped up' when he saw me land. He suggested we could have filed a flight of two; or returned the next morning and that he had 10 minutes before closing to file his report.

Approach to ZZZ last minute changed from Runway XX to the ZZZZZ Visual to Runway XYR. A vector heading was given to join a left downwind with the terrain and the airport in visual contact at all times VMC conditions. On joining the downwind while descending and configuring for landing with the terrain clearly visible off the right of the aircraft a caution alert 'terrain /terrain' was annunciated. This was a momentary alert as the rising ridge on the downwind was well off the horizontal plane of the aircraft and was cleared in seconds. More vigilance should have been given to closure rate while descending in this environment so as not to activate mode 2 GPWS.

While enroute ZZZ-ZZZ1 our center hydraulic quantity started decreasing. While reviewing the appropriate non-normal checklists in [App]; the application crashed twice. We had to close and restart it each time; which resulted in a loss of all open tabs. Essentially we had to start the checklists over from the beginning.This happens frequently (like once or twice per trip). [App] just freezes sometimes -- it doesn't matter whether you're connected to the internet or not.Flight Operations wants to remove paper QRH's from the airplanes. This absolutely cannot be allowed to happen until we have a replacement system that works 100% of the time.

I landed Runway XX in ZZZ during VMC conditions and exited the runway on A4. At that point; contacted ground and received clearance to taxi to parking (foxtrot) via alpha; cross XX. My student and I were taxing on alpha and wanted to double check to make sure we were cleared to cross Runway XX. Ground then confirmed we were cleared to cross Runway XX. We continued to taxi. As we approached Runway XX; my student and I proceeded to visually check Runway XX for traffic as a precaution. To the right; we saw an aircraft taking off Runway XX. Had we not held short of Runway XX at that time or checked late; there could have been a collision on the runway. Thankfully we held short. At that point I called tower and stated we were holding short of Runway XX for the plane that just took off. Tower then cleared us to cross XX for the 3rd time and apologized.

After clearing the Runway 36L at AUS on Taxiway G; Ground Control issued us taxi instructions:  'G; C; West Ramp on C.  The First Officer then went off frequency to call Operations. Just before reaching taxiway C; I looked to my left in the direction of the upcoming turn and saw a Aircraft Y; moving southbound on C at about 30-40 knots. I had to slam on my brakes in order to avoid a collision. I then made a snarky remark to the Ground Controller that a head's up about Aircraft Y jet would have been appreciated. He apologized and said something to us to indicate that he had been distracted by ramp traffic and airplanes waiting to get to gates. This could have been a catastrophic collision had I not been glancing to my left.  Recommend a dedicated ramp controller that deals with ramp traffic thereby allowing the Ground Controller to monitor and control the movement area.Ground Control distracted with ramp congestion and never told us about other aircraft.Suggest a dedicated Ramp Control frequency and Controller.

On DATE; crew scheduling contacted me requesting that I fly Aircraft X that evening due to crew fatigue. The previous crew had experienced a series of mechanical problems throughout the day; and I was to be the relief captain. Knowing this; I arrived at the gate approximately 15-20 minutes before scheduled show time to determine the status of the aircraft; and how repairs were proceeding. Mechanics were working on repairing the hydraulic systems on Aircraft X after a complete hydraulic failure earlier that day. Aircraft X was also being looked at for a pressurization issue. Maintenance believed the hydraulic issue was a simpler problem that could be resolved more expeditiously to minimize potential delay; and they told me it would take 45-60 minutes to complete. When I was notified that the repairs were completed; I returned to the aircraft with the First Officer; and I told him to coordinate with the ramp crew so that I could taxi Aircraft X from the auxiliary parking space to [gate]. I ensured that the hydraulic system was producing pressure via the hydraulic pressure gauge and the lack of annunciation on the annunciator panel. The nose wheel steering system (NWS) was not operating when I attempted to turn out of the parking space; so I shut down and NAME came over to the plane. After various tests and checks to determine the cause of inoperative NWS; and coordinating with NAME1 and NAME2; we determined that it would be best to defer maintenance on the NWS per the MEL procedure; and continue the flight without it. From this point; everything seemed to be returning to normal. I taxied Aircraft X to [gate]; the First Officer and I prepared it for passengers; and we boarded after being fueled. Engine start; taxi; pre-takeoff checks were all normal. During takeoff; after standard call outs; at approximately 100-102 KIAS; prior to our V1/Rotate speed of 106 KIAS; I noticed the taxi light located on the nose gear strut turn off; and the nose subsequently fell to the ground. I immediately and continuously held full aft yoke pressure to shift as much weight to the main gear struts as possible. The First Officer immediately requested priority handling and assisted me with holding the yoke aft. I then pulled both Stop and Feather controls simultaneously; and focused all of my effort to keep the plane on the runway center line using rudder only. I did not use any brakes. During this time I also clarified the nature of the situation with Tower; and requested priority vehicles to meet the plane. After rolling/sliding for approximately 10;000 feet; the First Officer and I looked out the flight deck windows to ensure that there was not a fire; and I asked the Tower if he could see any flames coming from our aircraft.When he answered in the negative. Leaving all exterior lights on; I instructed the First Officer to open the main cabin door; assist the passengers out of the aircraft; and take them to the grass on the East side of the runway. I made an announcement over the PA that we were deplaning; to follow the direction of the First Officer; and exit the plane via the main cabin door. I informed the Tower of all of these things; then assisted the remaining passengers out of the airplane. After ensuring everyone was unharmed; I returned to the aircraft to inform the tower that I was shutting down all remaining systems. I coordinated with company; emergency crews; and airport operations to manage the situation; and only returned to the aircraft a few minutes later to retrieve my jacket. There was an extremely simple step that could have prevented several of these issues along the way: thoroughly; diligently utilizing the acceptance/pre-flight checklist located in the aircraft to ensure the correct configuration of the flight deck. This was not done; and the pre-flight was accomplished by memory; without checklist verification or utilization. Because of this; the Gear Position Control lever was in the UP position throughout this entire chain of events; and was never corrected. It is almost certain to be the cause of the NWS issue; as well as the emergency on the runway. I can't speak for any other pilot; but I can say with absolute confidence that this critical step will never be missed by me again.

Staffing numbers for the evening shift were four below the number; eight out of twelve; plus one Controller in Charge for the entire shift. Supervisor for the morning/day shift called me at XA:00L asking if I could come in for two hours of overtime at the beginning of the shift since the night shift had taken sick hits. I was originally scheduled to be in at XF:00L and agreed to come in at XD:00L. The other person scheduled for a XF:00 shift also came in at XD:00 for two hours of overtime. The day shift had also taken sick hits and was below the number. Nine out of twelve. One person changed their shift from XD:00L to XZ:00L and was held over one hour at the end of their shift for coverage. Two certified D-Sides from the morning shift were held over two hours. There was one Controller in Charge for the entire night shift starting at XD:30LThe warning areas along the east coast were all active. Within fifteen minutes of working Sector 50; every sector in the area had a D-Side staffing; except Sector 25 (Low sector). On a normal day. D-Sides are not staffing unless it is for training or currency time. During the position relief briefing; I was told that coordination sector to sector had occurred for AR (Atlantic Routes) traffic; single flow over CARPX intersection (190 miles offshore) due to weather and a rocket launch. If aircraft were not offshore capable; then there were to be routed inland; down J121. This coordination had been started early during the day shift; but no official routing was on the status board. Surrounding areas had been told about it. Northern sectors were not participating with the reroutes and aircraft were departing with normal AR routing. There was thirty miles in trail for PBI; MIA; and FLL for aircraft filed down J121 (inland). I had been working roughly ten minutes when the daytime Supervisor came into the area and announced the ZJX inland sectors (J47/J48) had shut off southbound traffic and to expect the same call to my area's south sectors (09/35). About five minutes later; ZJZ sectors J48 and J47 shut off southbound traffic and told to hold. Sector 09 exhausted holding fixes and altitudes available to them with warning area still after. They coordinated the last plane they could take with me at Sector 50. My sector quickly exhausted available holding fixes and altitudes; again with warning areas active to the east. I coordinated with the sector to the northeast side; how many planes I could take from them and hold any other Florida traffic. Sector 34 (sector below mine) shut off daily departures from another sector to the north and told to hold any Florida traffic. Sector 09 shut off northbound traffic from ZJX after roughly twenty to thirty minutes due to holding stacks using every altitude. Any aircraft within sector 09 northbound were vectored to avoid the holding stacks.; which would be coming into my sector and had to be vectored around my holding stacks as well. Any aircraft not going to Florida; either southbound or westbound; also had to be vectored around holding stacks in my sector. After about forty to forty-five minutes later; ZJX started taking southbound traffic; thirty miles in trail per airport. By this time; some aircraft I had been holding requested to divert to nearby airports (RDU or CHS). These required lengthy vectoring to get them lower. Warning areas (W122 and W386) went cold/inactive to accommodate holding for the sectors they were in. W122 is in Sector 09; and W386 is in the sector north of the one I was working; Sector 39. This happened about the time I was being relieved from the sector. AR traffic could still be routed single flow over the CARPX fix if they were able. I was relieved from the sector at about XE:05L. I took a thirty minute break and when I returned; I relieved the controller at Sector 09. There was no longer holding; there was still thirty miles in trail for inland (J121) traffic; very low volume and D-Sides had been released from positions.Earlier in the day; ZJX had shut off ZTL southbound traffic; which in turn; ZTL had shut off the western areas of ZDC. The event that occurred on the east coast could have been avoided. Communication between the Command Center; TMU; and the Centers needs to improve. Although sector to sector coordination is a valuable tool for Controllers; it should not have to be used throughout an entirety of a day; when there is an ongoing issue with the NAS. This event was a complete breakdown in communication when feasible plans could have been put in place to help the centers being inundated with traffic who have weather or low staffing. (Ground stops; SWAP routing; etc.)

Plane had an air return the day before for nose gear noise on takeoff. We briefed and anticipated an issue. Normal takeoff just prior to 4000 ft. initial level off a thumping sound started followed later by a LGICU (Landing Gear Control Interface Unit) 2 FAIL ECAM. We leveled at 10;000 ft. and coordinated with Maintenance and Dispatch who all agreed we needed to return to ZZZ. We had burned below Max landing weight while coordinating so we returned for a normal landing. Tower did decide to [assign priority handling] for us. Upon landing we had an over wing exit show open. That turned out to be just the cover came off (another repeat from the day prior). PA to remain seated and coordinated with Flight Attendants that the exit was closed. Taxied to the Gate and swapped planes to go to ZZZ1.

Shortly after takeoff out of ZZZ airport we got an auto press caution message at around 3;500 ft. We elected to level off at 5000 ft. and get vectors away from the storms. I was Pilot Flying. I took controls and radios and asked my First Officer to pull out the Quick Reference Checklist and Quick Reference Handbook for Auto Press Caution message. We completed the checklists. Advised Dispatch; ATC; and Flight Attendants. I received reports of ear discomfort from the Flight Attendants.I noted we had passengers onboard who were susceptible to medical issues from potential extraneous ear pressure; i.e. babies and older passengers. We elected to return to the airfield in the interest of safety. Other contributing factors I had in mind were storms; high cruising altitude; high task saturation; and the increase of risk factor of potential further issues/emergencies/failures that could arise in flight on top of the already highly task saturated duty of manual pressurization and deviations of storms.Auto pressurization failure; inner ear pressure issues potentially causing damage. Task saturation. If anything else were to occur during flight on top of having to dedicate duties away from flying to control the pressurization manually then it would increase risk factor and degrade pilot attentiveness and safety of flight further.

Uneventful Qual Line Check flight to ZZZ from ZZZ1. After the passengers had deplaned; our Flight Attendant (FA) cabin jump seater entered the flight deck and informed the pilots that doors 1L and 1R had incorrect placards installed. Specifically; the placards with the word 'OPEN' and the illustration on how to open the main cabin door in a priority situation. The placards for the 'Left' doors are mirror images of the placards for the 'Right' doors. The difference being the orientation of the diagram. She explained that she had found this discrepancy on 'at least 10' aircraft; that it was a 'no-go item' and that we should write it up once we were inbound to ZZZ1; since cabin inspectors would be looking for this issue. I thanked her for bringing this to our attention; and explained the requirement to write up any known discrepancies or irregularities as soon as they were known. We contacted Maintenance and described the issue; and they dispatched a contract mechanic; who did a fantastic job deferring the issue. They printed facsimile placards and fastened them in place; resulting in minimal delays. I bring this to the attention for several reasons. This aircraft as obviously operated numerous flight segments with improper placards installed.  I recommend reaching out to Maintenance to see if a fleet directive or other inspection program should be initiated to check for similar errors. Should consider reaching out to the safety team in case there are mechanics who should file reports for the incorrect placard installation. Should consider reaching out so that the jump seating Flight Attendant can submit a report with her perspective on the event. What is most troubling for me is that she likely noticed this issue during boarding in ZZZ1; as she was one of the first people on the aircraft and had notified numerous crews of this issue yet she chose to wait until her commuter flight arrived in ZZZ to notify the crew of the discrepancy. This act indicates that our Inflight Services partners might need to re-emphasize the importance of notifying the flight deck as soon as they find a defect or discrepancy with the aircraft.

I was flying in the pattern doing takeoff and landing practice. It was extremely crowded with many airplanes in the pattern. I was on the downwind getting close to turning base to Runway 31. That circuit is a right pattern. I was probably alerted by TCAS; but I looked at my display and saw an aircraft close to me and below on my left side. I looked out the window and there was another airplane passing below me from my left to my right. I then saw it about 200 or 300 ft. below me on my right side. At that moment the Tower Controller asked if I saw the airplane on my right. I responded with yes" and then I said that "I just flew over him." I then proceeded to turn base and subsequently land. At that time; I was surprised that the controller didn't warn me about the airplane; but I continued my day without thinking much about it.This evening I was reflecting on what happened and realized that the incident could have been my fault. I don't recall the Tower saying to follow another airplane before landing. If so; then I should have kept that airplane in sight. As I am thinking now; if that was the case; maybe the other airplane was in the downwind leg as normal or possibly rather wide. Then; maybe I continued in the downwind pattern moving closer to the runway than the other airplane; which would put me to the right of it. It then turned to base and passed below me. By the time I saw it; it was too close for me to take any evasive action; even if I thought it was necessary.It may have been lucky that I was about 250 ft. above the published pattern altitude and the other airplane was either at pattern altitude or lower; giving us a wide margin. Had that not been the case it could have been a near miss or worse."
