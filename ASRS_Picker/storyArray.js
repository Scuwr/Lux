When the landing gear was extended for landing at ZZZ; the left brake indicated 600 lbs and the right brake indicated 250 lbs. Pressing the brake pedals had no effect. Went around and held while consulting with Dispatcher; Maintenance Control & Tech Pilot. Cycling the brake/antiskid switch had no effect. Consensus was a normal landing would be OK. [Requested priority handling] and landed normally. Pressure in blocks still shows 600 left; 250 right.

Climbing through roughly 17;000 ft. the Captain and I noticed a smell similar to a hot oven. It was not strong and we did not feel any adverse effects. The Captain called to the back and they confirmed nothing was in the oven and that they smelled it as well. As we leveled at 22;000 the smell dissipated and we assumed it was transitory. Upon final descent (7;000 on the downwind) into ZZZ we faintly smelled it again for a very brief period but it went away just as quickly. Once we parked we conferred with the flight attendants who informed us that the smell was worse in the back. Upon landing; we were evaluated by paramedics. I had a headache; dry metallic mouth; and all my vitals were normal. The smell itself did not cause alarm. It was not overwhelming; with no reduction in visibility; and no adverse effects inflight.

RPLC Ramp [erroneously] loaded ADG (Air Carrier Dangerous Goods container) in position 7R inso '[instead of] on a Hazmat pallet where it was accessible. RPLC Ramp loaded flammable liquid in a regular container and loaded in the back of the aircraft and departed. Once airborne the mistake was caught and they contacted me and I advised the crew via ACARS; the Supervisor and ZZZ Operations Control and Maintenance. Not sure if there was a language barrier since it was from RPLC to ZZZZ and it appeared some of the labels may have been in English?

We departed ZZZ and; upon rotation; immediately required an abnormal aileron control correction to maintain wings level. We knew instantly that something was not correct with the aircraft. We [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ for landing which occurred without incident. Upon consultation with Company at the FBO at ZZZ; we found that the fuel was out of balance. The fuel was balanced with the onboard fuel transfer system; and it was determined that there was no mechanical fault with the plane.Before take-off; and during our routine check of EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System); no flags or warnings as to any fuel imbalance were observed. In order to prevent a reoccurrence; we have incorporated an additional checklist item so as to verify fuel is balanced. Additionally; this situation will be discussed with all pilots that fly this aircraft.

We were operating to Detroit. The flight was operated normally and uneventfully until our downwind to base turn in the approach phase. During the downwind; we were advised that we were following a heavy A350 on a visual approach to 3R. We were assigned by Detroit Approach to descend to 4;000 ft.; maintain a speed of 190 kts. and fly a heading to turn base. During our descent and turn; we encountered an excessive rate (25-30 degrees) of roll to the left (back towards the downwind) and pitch (approximately +10 degrees) from the wake of the A350.The First Officer (Pilot Flying) and I (Pilot Monitoring) simultaneously disconnected the autopilot. The First Officer properly responded by arresting the rate of roll; pitch and decrease in speed in accordance with the CFM. We had gained approximately 600 ft. from the wake turbulence and stabilized the aircraft on a downwind heading at 5;000 ft. and speed of 190 kts. I advised ATC of the wake turbulence upset and what we were doing to stabilize the aircraft. They acknowledged us and once we were stable; I queried ATC about being cleared to resume our descent to 4;000 ft. ATC re-cleared us to 4;000 ft.; and we proceeded inbound and landed without further issue.The wake turbulence of the A350 had created an excessive roll rate (25-30 degrees) back towards the downwind and a positive pitch (approximately 10 degrees) and a negative speed trend. As we turned our base; we encountered the roll back towards the opposite direction and then recovered on the downwind leg and had a slight climb from the positive pitch.

On climb from ZZZ noticed oil temp rising faster on right engine; as aircraft approached cruise altitude of FL370 we were hoping the oil temp would decrease but even after power back for cruise the oil temp kept rising slowly. Ran checklist and reduced power slightly; temp still rising; powered back to 50%; still rising; airspeed decreasing now asked for lower and decided to go back to ZZZ. Temp did not decrease until much lower altitude; Seemed normal under 10;000 feet. Returned to ZZZ and landed uneventfully. Never did oil temp reach red line but was very close for quite a while.

Our trip was originally scheduled as a commercial flight to ZZZZ with a 24 hour layover then operate back to ZZZ. We were rescheduled to DH (Dead Head) on Aircraft Y and immediately operate back as Aircraft X with no layover. This was my first trip back after vacation and my FO (First Officer) flew week prior. The arrival into ZZZZ had thunderstorms with low ceiling. Inbound crew broke out on arrival at 500 ft. with marginal VFR conditions at field. We took over aircraft as inbound crew went to hotel. We both did preflight duties and took our time. The CREW SAFETY briefing was very thorough. We discussed threats in detail. Fatigue; night ops in ZZZZ versus daytime; weather; terrain; communication; complex engine out procedures and my lack of recent flying. Then reviewed ZZZZ [information]. The performance verification was not rushed and all checklist completed 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Engine start; push back; taxi out were all normal. I was Pilot Flying and we were cleared for departure on Runway XX (Winds were 090/3; temp 14C; altimeter 1029 hPa; dry runway. Aircraft TOGW 345;700; thrust D TO 29; V1 154; VR 156; V2 160; N1 107.1). Thrust was set initially to 70% N1. Engines spooled up normally. Thrust mode was selected and engine accelerated normally. 80 knots was called out by PM (Pilot Monitoring) and verified and checked. I noticed I was drifting slightly right of centerline. I added left rudder to correct. The acceleration did not seem normal at this time (approximately passing 100 knots). This perception was based on past heavy weight; high altitude takeoffs. I glanced at EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) and engine instrument gauges and noticed N1 for right engine was rolling back and left was still at 107. I made decision to reject at approximately 118 knots. RTO (Rejected Takeoff) engaged as advertised and rapidly stopped the aircraft. We cleared runway and let tower know our intention to return to parking. During taxi back we discussed brake temperatures; FO asked ATC to have ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) called. FO called Dispatch which confirmed Block Turn Back. When in parking; asked mechanic to only chock nose wheel and stay away from main gear. No parking brake. Accomplished shutdown and secure checklist. Mechanic confirmed brakes were heated which agreed with our brake temp light on and BTMS (Brake Temperature Monitoring System) numbers increasing to 8s and 9s. We reviewed rejected takeoff procedure in AOM especially notes. We then (per AOM) reviewed Chapter 5 cooling chart for 767. Coordination between cockpit; mechanic and ARFF was good (Four tire fuse plugs melted and tires deflated). ARFF departed after no signs of further hazard.

While acting as Pilot Flying Aircraft X ZZZ to ZZZ1; during our takeoff roll and shortly before rotation speed a 'Tire failure' alert was triggered. As we continued our takeoff; once airborne the Pilot Monitoring inadvertently retracted the landing gear; however extended it again to remain compliant with company procedures. As we continued our climb; the Captain decided to assume aircraft controls and asked me to run the QRH procedures for TIRE FAIL. At the same time; we notified ATC about our situation; intentions to return to the airport and requested fuel dumping. Upon reaching ATC assigned altitude and vectors; we were authorized to start the fuel dump; which we performed as per the QRH's FUEL DUMP checklist. Before we landed on Runway XXR; we decided to [request priority handling] as a precaution and the landing was performed uneventfully. Upon exiting the runway; fire truck personnel indicated over the radio that all landing gear tires looked well; with the exception of a nose-wheel tire that seemed low. We then taxied to the gate uneventfully.[Identified] after V1; shortly before rotation speed. Although the tire pressure indications for one of the nose gear was deferred; the TIRE FAIL alert was not deactivated. Follow company procedures and ensure proper maintenance procedures for deferrals are performed.

After Takeoff from ZZZ we were unable to retract the landing gear. The First Officer was flying and after checking for an ECAM exception or quick action item I assigned flying duties and ATC communications to the First Officer. I completed the ECAM actions which failed to remedy the situation so I advised the First Officer to head to ZZZ1. I made a quick PA since it was very noisy just to put everyone at ease while I pulled out my QRH then completed the appropriate follow up items. I then notified the #1 Flight Attendant with the test items then made another PA explaining the situation. I then used the crew phone to call Dispatch and they were aware we were headed to ZZZ1. Since we were going to land at 182;000 pounds I reviewed the overweight landing checklist and discussed the options with the First Officer. The weather was clear with calm winds and a long Runway so decided it was best to land rather than burn off gas for an hour or more. I also called Dispatch to tell them my intention to make an overweight landing. The First Officer made the landing and everything was normal so we taxied to the Gate.

IMC; Pilot in Command; Pilot Flying [on] arrival; getting vectors for Runway XX; weather 800/3 WIND 320/16G26; Altimeter 999 MB. 5000 ft.; flaps 5; 200 KTS. ATC says ' cleared direct ZZZZZ; descend 3000 ft. cleared RNAV XX approach. Transition Level is 4500 ft. being close in to ZZZZZ on autopilot; Pilot Flying wanted FLCH to 3000 quickly so as to engage LVSAFE process ASAP. When prompted Altimeters; at Transition Level of 4500; by the time all altimeters set going from STD to 999 MB instantly lost approximately 800 ft.; do to transiting to LOW pressure aircraft was slightly below 3000 Autopilot didn't capture altitude selected above it. Auto throttles did not wake up slowed to 180 KTS; until recovery had to be initiated manually at 2740 with power and autopilot disconnected. Autopilot was re-selected at 3000 ft. and the approach was accomplished uneventfully. A safety representative called me and was asked to file company report.The Transition Level was known to the crew and we were prepared for the transition. What was not prepared for the instant loss of 1000 due to the very low altimeter setting; in a good descent rate put the aircraft below the selected altitude. The autopilot did not capture; an attempt on the MCP was made to change pitch mode and reacquire the selected altitude of 3000; and no autopilot response was met with a manual pilot intervention at 2740. All taken place after 10 hour all-nighter; IMC; and both pilots less than 100 hours in type; however familiar with ZZZZ in other Aircraft and seats. I recommend a published company procedure for this eventuality and crew awareness brief; so as to not be surprised by it. Lesser experienced crews might have gotten into real trouble. An easy to read conversion chart on altitude differences from flight ops on the briefing guide might be in order.

Immediately after takeoff from our departure airport; my student and I experienced significant unexpected turbulence and wind shear that causes us to make the decision to return to our departure airport. We were vectored for the ILS and intercepted the localizer at the proper altitude and were then cleared the visual approach. At that point we encountered even more significant wind shear and turbulence causing us to descend below the minimum altitude for an ILS approach. During the loss of altitude we had just switched to the Tower frequency and were cleared to land at which point Tower relayed a message from TRACON saying 'altitude alert' and that we were below the published altitude on the approach. I confirmed to Tower we had the field and terrain in sight and that we were unable to maintain altitude. Although a significant crosswind had picked up since our departure; an uneventful landing followed.

I refused [the] aircraft due to excessive MEL's that negatively affected flight safety being Dispatched into convective weather and rain with possible low ceilings at destination. Flight was dispatched away from a maintenance base with 6 MEL's of which when all tallied up affected multiple aircraft systems both on the ground and in flight. Notable systems were; loss of thrust reverser; loss of predictive Windshear; loss of auto start protections requiring manual start; loss of avionics bay cooling functions; loss of all nose gear lights(expected arrival time would have been dark or near dark) and loss of brake cooling among many others. Also it set the airplane up for a single point failure (failure of lcgiu1) for a complete loss of autopilot and flight director function in addition to the above. There is no good reason to send an aircraft in that condition with a full passenger load out of a heavy maintenance base into the weather conditions that were present at the time of scheduled departure. MEL's that were applied to aircraft were. XX-XX; XX-XXg; XX-XXb; XX-XXb; XX-XXa; and XX-XX.Causal factor is flight operations and maintenance failure to consider the excessive work load and backup system loss that resulted from this MEL combination being Dispatched into potentially heavy weather arriving at night. In addition the failure to consider the consequences of having another failure in flight with so many systems already degraded or inoperative. My suggestion is when these decisions are being made for the decision maker to ask themselves 'would I want my family on that airplane'. In the case of this aircraft; my bet their answer would be a definite no.

Aircraft X began with a report time of XA:15 local time at ZZZ with a destination of ZZZ1. Upon maintenance logbook review; two items of note were the INOP APU [for oil quantity I believe] and a #2 engine igniter INOP. These MEL items required an engine start at the gate with external air cart and a manual start for Engine #2. Aircraft was blocked with Engine 2 started at the gate under guidance from Section 7 reference material. Unable to cross bleed start in the alley the aircraft repositioned for a 'Cross bleed start' to taxi for departure. At this point the inflight called forward to inform us of a loss of all electrical power in in the cabin and trouble using the interphones. The galley power had shed and was only indicated by a note on the electrical page of the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor).  As per procedure I made a call to Dispatch and Maintenance Control for further direction. A description of the events was given to Maintenance Control and I asked for their direction to restore the galley bus. Under direction of Maintenance Control; I reset Sec 1; 2 and 3. I am unsure why the SECs would be used for the solution; but I defer to the knowledge of MX (Maintenance) Control. I never attempted to start the remaining engine which may have cured the problem; mostly because of the trouble with interphones and the unexpected galley issues. The call to MX Control was to get help in assessment of the failures and to find an easy solution. The reset was unsuccessful and Maintenance directed me to return to gate have the local maintenance fix the problem. Which to me indicated a larger aircraft systems problem.  In the hour of troubleshooting; the customers were left without air-conditioning and the cabin reached 90 degrees with many of the customers complaining of the heat. A water service was started by the inflight.  Back at the gate Maintenance was unable to reset the galley power by normal procedures and worked on the problem for one hour. The solution was to start both engines and the INOP APU; which MX started while still on MEL [the MEL was never cleared] at the gate along with a reset of the galley bus to restore galley function. I was told push off the gate with both engines as the solution. The aircraft was boarded and customers seated so we closed up received a new release and fuel summary for block out. The flight blocked out at XB:12 local.  At push back the wheel chocks were lodged in place and unable to be moved with both engines running. The push crew advised that we needed to shut an engine down to free the chocks. I asked for Maintenance on the interphone and a MX person answered on the tug comm. I advised that shutting down may cause the same galley problem and might result in a gate return a second time. Maintenance understood and recommended the Engine 2 shut down; to free the chocks; so Engine 2 was shut down.  With the chocks free the push continued with Engine 1 running which resulted in the same situation of loss of electrical aft of the cockpit. The push was stopped at my request and the aircraft towed into the gate at XB:22 local with the same MX problem and logbook entry.  I notified Dispatch of the return and a waited for further instructions from operations. At XC:00 local I called fatigued for the flight as a departure at this point would have had an arrival time of XD:00 local in ZZZ1 and I was not safe to operate the far into the red eye period.   I was never informed that all the failures might be normal and associated with the APU inop and single engine start. If so I would have continued with the normal operation and chock the situation up to my failure to recognize the associated failures.

While in cruise; we heard a popping sound followed by a short hissing sound. To me it sounded like an O2 mask or line broke and then was slowly leaking. We looked around the for the source and the Captain discovered it was the Halon Fire Extinguisher by feeling air from the pressure gauge. After a moments pause of realizing what happened; the Captain directed us to put on our O2 masks and establish communication. Once we completed that; the Captain transferred the controls to me and started looking for the correct QRH procedure. There were no direct correlation procedures for our situation and so we choose to start at Smoke and Fumes checklist as it was the highest level of danger we could start with. The Captain did a great job of keeping the situation calm and at the right level of urgency. He contacted [Operations] and was then connected to [Maintenance Control] as well. [Maintenance Control] did not have any direct guidance available for our given situation. Next the Captain ran the Toxic Substance check list. This did not really apply because it was directed more towards a cabin problem. During the whole situation; the Captain asked how I was feeling and if I felt any effects of possible halon inhalation. I never felt any ill effects. [Maintenance Control] was unable to give us any good information on how long the Halon would last in the flight deck due to no procedures for this event. After about 20 minutes we felt it was safe to remove our O2 masks and continue to ZZZ. We made that decision based on not seeing any evidence of Halon discharge (we later discovered we were both mistaken on what that would look like); the discharge from the fire bottle seemed to have stopped (no sounds; no felt air coming from the previous spot and bottle pressure holding steady for the last 15 minutes); and after some additional information from [Maintenance Control]; we felt the air had sufficiently circulated through the flight deck. We both kept our O2 mask at hand and ready to don again if the bottle where to release again.The location of the fire extinguisher lends itself in inadvertent contact as crew and team members transit the flight deck. Meaning; as people get out of the left seat; they can be making contact with the bottle without noticing or as a way to stabilize them themselves if they lose balance getting out of the seat or the jumpseat. Over time it is conceivable that the gauge could lose structural integrity to the point of not being able to hold the correct pressure any longer. Suggestions to Prevent: none that I can think of now. It would have been helpful to have known what to expect when the bottle is discharged (i.e. powder versus clear gas; odor; effects; timing of effects.) A quick brief on what Halon looks like; how it effects the body and perhaps a review on if a QRH procedure might be needed might be a few ways to mitigate problems if this were to happen again.
