Was flying from ZZZ to ZZZ1. Around 17 miles out I started my descent; when I pushed the mixture full forward the engine sputtered; then shut off. I tried adjusting the mixture and did some troubleshooting but could not get it started again. [Requested priority handling] with ZZZ1 TRACON and glided to ZZZ2; a private grass strip. My passenger was an A&P mechanic (we were flying to ZZZ1 to repair another plane so he had tools and parts onboard) and determined the cause of the failure was a faulty bolt connecting the mixture cable to the carburetor. The bolt released when I started my descent and shut the engine off. We were able to have the plane repaired on site and completed our flight to ZZZ1 later that day.

A few minutes prior to crossing the fix ZZZZZ; the Relief Pilot and the Relief Pilot Monitoring was asked by ATC if they would like a shortcut. The said yes and was given a direct to the fix ZZZZZ1. This caused our flight track to penetrate ZZZZ airspace and follow just north of the coast line. It appears we did not overfly any ZZZZ landmass. Around XX40Z the Relief Pilots called me in the bunk and when I came up to the cockpit; I was informed of what had happened.The Relief Pilots may have forgotten we cannot overfly ZZZZ with the [Hazmat] cargo we were carrying at the time.Better brief before departure emphasizing special cargo and the need to stay on flight plan to avoid overflying certain countries. Better brief of Relief Pilots reminding them of the need to stay out of certain airspace.

Configured and flying jump run. The left wing appeared to have lost lift causing a spin. Aircraft control was recovered within 5;000 ft. While the event was happening; a couple of jumpers left the aircraft upon which some skin damage occurred. Was able to land the aircraft safely with the jumpers that remained on board. We had a loss of lift on the left wing; so it has stalled. After speaking with the Company; we are going to run the jump run at a higher speed.

At FL 390; approximately 20 NM SE of ZZZ; ATC notified us of reports of moderate turbulence ahead. I had already asked the Flight Attendants to secure the cabin. The Passengers were seated with the Fasten Seat Belt sign on. I asked the Flight Attendants if they were seated and they said they were still securing the cabin. Shortly after that; moderate turbulence was encountered and I made a PA stating; 'Flight Attendants be seated; Flight Attendants be seated.'  Shortly after that; the PF (Pilot Flying) inquired if everyone was seated. I called the Flight Attendants to ask if everyone was seated. I was told by a Flight Attendant that 'Everyone is seated.' Shortly after that; we encountered severe turbulence for about 10 seconds. The aircraft rolled left then right about 30 degrees each way. We also had an updraft and downdraft; resulting in a loss of about 400 ft. altitude and a Mach overspeed of 0.82 for about eight seconds. PF regained control of aircraft quickly. ATC was contacted for a descent to FL 350.  Leveled off at FL 350.  I asked the Flight Attendants if everyone was ok and was told that the B FA (Flight Attendants) had minor injuries. I notified ATC of the severe turbulence and one minor Crew injury. I notified Dispatch of the same and requested EMS meet us at the gate in ZZZ.  Throughout the remainder of the flight; I periodically asked about the status of the B FA. A deadheading FA told me the B had been returned to her Jumpseat and had a sore hip and shoulder. We landed uneventfully in ZZZ. EMS met us at the gate and took the B FA to the hospital; accompanied by the deadheading FA. I was told later that B FA had no injuries other than soreness.  Flight Attendants should get seated and strapped in when a Pilot makes an announcement over the PA for them to be seated; as per the Pilot's [Maintenance Facility].

On the landing rollout in ZZZ; landing Runway XX; I saw a family of geese come out of the grass between the runway and taxiway. We were in the process of slowing to exit the Runway. The geese were initially moving from west to east across the runway but then turned north as they saw the airplane coming. I maneuvered the aircraft nose wheel slightly to the right of centerline to not hit the geese with the nose gear and I saw the geese go by down the left side of the airplane. They were all still on the ground at that time. I never saw them attempting to fly. I would estimate our speed as being around 50 kts. as we passed the geese and slowing.I notified Tower of the geese on the runway and that we might have struck them. We turned off the runway and turned south on [taxiway] to the gate. On the way past I could see at least 2 geese still on the runway just south of [taxiway]. We taxied to the gate. I did a thorough post flight inspection of the aircraft. I could not identify where on the aircraft we struck the geese. I notified Maintenance and Maintenance Personnel came and checked the aircraft as well and could not find signs of the bird strike. Airport Operations came to the aircraft and I spoke with them. They informed me that there were 4 geese found deceased on the Runway X full grown and 2 babies. One of the operations personnel was surprised by the lack of blood on the geese. I informed ZZZ Ground that we had observed no damage on the aircraft.

At 1;500 feet AGL on final to ZZZ XXR I called for 'Landing checklist - below the line'. At 'Flaps' it was observed that the flap handle was at 30 but the flap position indicator displayed flaps 1.We elected to increase airspeed to the white caret on the airspeed indicator and proceed with the landing. We did not set the Ground Proximity Flap Inhibit switch to 'Flap Inhibit' which resulted in receiving the 'Too Low - Terrain' aural warning. The aircraft was on profile so we ignored the warning and landed normally; with a slightly longer than normal rollout.After touchdown the 'PSEU' (Proximity Switch Electronic Unit) light illuminated and the flaps moved to 30. We were able to raise the flaps after clearing the runway; subsequently the 'PSEU' light extinguished.Cause - We elected to land in lieu of going around in an aircraft with unknown possible flight control issues. Aircraft was on profile on a clear night with light winds and a long runway. The alternative was to take the aircraft back into the air to perform the QRH procedure and attempt an alternate flap extension procedure.Suggestions - This would be a useful training scenario.

While climbing out of ZZZ approximately FL200 the Captain mentioned his flight displays were flickering. Then approximately FL250 we had a L GEN FAIL EICAS along with associated load shed messages; the captain ran the QRH for the L GEN FAIL and power was restored. About a minute or two later; all the instruments started flashing as well flags on the round dials; both left and Center CRTs were flashing as well. The Captain turned off the left generator and all but the load shed items came back online. Once he started the APU the load shed items came back online also. We [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ.

Everything from the moment we got into the aircraft at the gate; and all the way up until just after the top of climb was normal. Everything was operating normally; some MELs; but we already knew about it. The Captain went to the lav; and the Flight Attendant took the open seat according to the Company's procedures. I showed her how far we had to go and how much time we have left on the PROG page on my FMS; then I noticed an amber indication off the left corner of my eye. I noticed the LP vibrations on the right engine was 4.0 amber. All other vibrations were no higher than 0.5 and green. The entire EICAS was full. Once the Captain returned I immediately showed him. He pulled out the QRH and we ran the Engine Abnormal Vibration checklist. QRH called to slow down .02 mach; so we did. Went from .78 to .76. No change; it went to green for a few seconds; but came back to amber. It also called to descend 2000 ft.; so we did. Went from FL330 to FL310. No change; it went to green for a few seconds; but came back to amber.Then we tried again going down to FL290 and slowed our airspeed. Again; no change; it went to green for a few seconds; but came back to amber. I cannot recall if we tried a third time; I think we did; but I do remember being at FL270. We tried reducing the power on the affected engine to maintain green LP vibrations and (if I recall) increasing the non affected engine. But we weren't able to maintain airspeed. I believe at this time we were around 230 kts. and decreasing. Up until this time; I was PF (Pilot Flying). CA (Captain) decided its safer to secure the affected engine and divert. I agreed. I believe we agreed upon a diversion airport before we shut the engine down. I thought ZZZ was a good option. It was one of our bases; also one of our maintenance bases too. It was ~180nm away. CA thought ZZZ1 was a better option since it was closer (~120nm). We then both agreed on ZZZ1. We checked the weather at ZZZ1 and it showed VFR. CA requested priority handling and we got vectored to ZZZ1. At this point we switched roles. I became PM (Pilot Monitoring) and he became PF. We did hand over the controls multiple times to assist each other in other tasks throughout the diversion/descent. Basically; anytime I was reading the checklist; I was PM. Anytime CA was making a call to the passengers and FAs (Flight Attendant) in the cabin; I would be PF. Right after CA [advised] ATC and got a vector to ZZZ1; we secured the affected engine. Next; I could not recall which order these were in; but we accomplished these tasks in the order of the QRH: I got our landing speeds from the shutdown checklist. CA notified Dispatch via ACARS. CA notified FAs. CA notified passengers. I had difficulty clearing out the flight plan by dragging the destination airport to the top. CA helped; but had difficulty too. It could be a bug in the planes computer; it's an older E170. I just deleted every fix by hand. It only took about 20 seconds.Multiple descent clearances and headings. Visual app and landing XXL.

Aircraft taxied beyond hold short point. Received taxi clearance to taxi to Runway 4R BOS. Clearance was taxi to [Runway] 4R via [Taxiways] E1; K; B; hold short of Juliet. Give way to [Aircraft Z] from your right. I read back clearance correctly; wrote it down; then read it again to the CA (Captain). I cleared him right after the [Aircraft Z] passed for his right onto [Taxiway] E1. I informed Ground we were awaiting numbers. Close out printed after turning onto [Taxiway] K and I informed Ground we had our numbers. I told CA I was heads down and entered numbers and briefed closeout. We checked flight controls on [Taxiway] K. I cleared him right onto [Taxiway] B and went heads down to complete the before take off flow and checklist. When I announced 'to the line' and performed that flow he said continue. We performed checklist below the line and announced before takeoff checklist complete. I heard [a] radio call [for us to] hold position. I responded to Tower and I looked up to see we were in the bend of Taxiway B and I asked CA if he had passed [Taxiway] Juliet. He said yes; and realized we'd gone past the hold short at [Taxiway] Juliet. [Aircraft Y] was told to go around and we were then cleared across [Runway] 4L and cleared for takeoff without further incident. The CA copied the taxi clearance that I repeated; but failed to write down the hold short of [Taxiway] Juliet instructions. We originally thought we would get [Runway] 33L due to performance and briefed that taxi on the departure briefing. We received [Runway] 4R as our runway with our push clearance. It was not on the ATIS for a departure runway. The taxi to [Runway] 4R was briefed but was a short taxi requiring a lot of heads down time for the FO (First Officer) due to delayed closeout numbers. I was not familiar with Boston having only been there a couple of times and did not know of the Non-standard position of the [Runway] 4L holdshort on [Taxiway] Bravo at [Taxiway] Juliet. There was a lot of aircraft taxiing in both directions adding another distraction. Taxiway Bravo does not cross the inner Runway 4L giving the impression one would not need to stop until reaching the hold short for [Runway] 4R. There are no hold bars or lights at [Taxiway] Juliet. [Suggest] Hold lights at the hold short on [Taxiway] Bravo at [Taxiway] Juliet when there is landing traffic on [Runway] 4L. Tower call for aircraft to hold short of [Runway] 4L on [Taxiway] Bravo at [Taxiway] Juliet for landing traffic after the handoff to them from ground on [Taxiway] Kilo.

On a stage 2 private check short field landing; my student landed and applied an unnecessary amount of braking which resulted in the airplane skidding and then our left tire blowing. I did call for flight controls once we started skidding but it was too late. Once the tire was blown I had controls and was able to keep the airplane from leaving the runway surface. Afterward we secured the aircraft; called the fbo to advise them we were stuck on the runway and to NOTAM it closed. Then I called Maintenance so they could come out and change our tire.Practice doing short field landings to full stops with students and emphasize braking should only be as necessary to stop in required distance while maintaining safety and positive aircraft control.

Aircraft X on walk around found right pack exhaust diffuser mount brackets broken. This will allow the diffuser to spin and cause the fan bypass check valve to stay open at all times which may cause a pack overheat and get a pack O/H light in the flight deck. See log page X. Aircraft taken out of service for repairs.

Flying the ORD7 departure; PEKUE fix; the FMS had PEKUE loaded twice. We did not catch it on the route briefing. We got to PEKUE and the aircraft tried to make a right turn to circle over PEKUE again. We caught it and the First Officer quickly TCS'd to stay on course until I could fix the FMS. ATC did not say anything to us. This issue happened the last time I flew the ORD7 to a different fix. We luckily caught it in the route briefing. My suggestion is do not load the ORD7 into the FMS. There is no need as this departure is strictly radar vectors. There are no RNAV tracks anywhere on this departure either. Loading it into the FMS does absolutely nothing. The initial fix is part of the flight plan; and the departure itself is not even listed on the release. There is a glitch in our FMS database that's allowing this to happen. We did not change departure runways or anything that would've caused this.

We received a TCAS RA while being vectored for the visual approach to Runway 36 at PIE. We were flying an assigned heading of 180 degrees and assigned speed of 170 knots when Tampa Approach advised us of traffic at our 12 o'clock and below. I was able to see the traffic on TCAS; but unable to visually acquire it. A moment later we received a TCAS RA to climb. We followed the advisory and climbed 300-400 feet at which time we received another advisory that we were clear of the conflict. I immediately advised ATC of the TCAS RA at which time the Controller instructed us to descend back to 3;000 feet. Tampa Approach had no further comment. I believe the conflict was caused by a VFR aircraft that was 500 feet below us; underneath the Class B and may have initiated a climb.

Was training a developmental on the R side. The developmental cleared Aircraft X off of ZZZ via the departure to 14000 ft. The clearance was relayed through flight data. The aircraft then departed what looked like Runway XX and was heading directly south towards RZZZZZ. The departure procedure was not followed by the pilot since they are only allowed to depart off Runway XY. I then instructed the aircraft below the MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude) to make a turn to the north I needed you to follow the departure. The aircraft was well below the MIA which is the reason for the report. Let the aircraft continue to do a pilot deviation and go into restricted areas.

Accepted an aircraft with a deferred aircraft pack and dispatched with one operating pack. While in cruise at FL340; the single operating pack did not maintain a cabin altitude below 10;000 ft. We followed the QRH and descended to 10;000 ft.I tried numerous times to contact Flight Control; but could not get anyone to answer. Next; I tried to contact Flight Control via ARINC; but received no answer. I was able to contact Company and asked them to relay to Company that we were diverting to ZZZ1. We landed without further incident. [I suggest] preventative maintenance. I was told by Maintenance after landing that the aircraft had a massive duct leak.

After a normal engine start; with the parking brake still set; both crew members were heads down in the cockpit. We were getting clearance and setting up the cockpit. We both felt movement of the airplane at the same moment and looked up and the plane had moved; we quickly got on the pedal brakes to stop the aircraft. There was a lineman that was near the nose of the aircraft giving us a stop sign for a moving aircraft. The aircraft came close to them and could have caused an incident without our quick reaction. We had no intention of moving at that time; and still did not move for a few moments after due to setting up the cockpit and the stop sign from the lineman. The parking brake was trusted to do its job; and was checked multiple times prior to start; but at that moment; it did not. The lessons learned: keep your feet on the brakes even when the parking brake is set in case the brake gives way; and one pilot should be heads up at all times. I plan to implement both of these moving forward.

Material Logistic Specialist on duty in the ZZZ Warehouse Shipping Department was preparing material for the Load Device 3 can to ship to Company Maintenance Base. Material Logistic Specialist came across Airways Bill Parcel which is in a black hard sided case. The paperwork on the outside of the box was a hand written note that said send to [shop]. This shop is a Company shop. [The box had the address; Name and Vendor Number] on the repair order. This is not the appropriate paperwork to ship something. When Material Logistic Specialist opened the case she found a repair order # XXXXXXX that was shipped from ZZZ1 on Airway Bill XXX-XXXXXXXX to ZZZ. There was Hazmat paperwork with the shipment that had been generated. None of the repair order paperwork had a Hazardous Materials sticker attached. When I did some research I discovered that this cleared customs on Date and brought to the base by freight truck on that day [who] took the shipment to ZZZ Warehouse Receiving Dept where it would be sorted to where it would go or be received into inventory.
